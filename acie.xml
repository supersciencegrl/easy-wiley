         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Kinetic Boron Conjugate Addition of &#947;&#8208;Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>Chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing simple &#947;&#8208; substituents are found in biologically active molecules and natural products, however, their synthesis still remains difficult. Herein, we report an efficient kinetic resolution of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams via a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric boron conjugate addition, which also leads to the efficient synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbon centers. The kinetic resolution proceeded smoothly with a wide range of &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituted substrates including those bearing aromatic heterocycles and different N&#8208;protected substrates in up to 347 of s value. Their highly versatile transformations, synthetic utility in biologically active molecules, and inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cell A2780 have also been demonstrated. Differing from the well&#8208;known mechanism involving Cu&#8208;B species in Cu&#8208;catalyzed boron conjugate additions, our mechanistic studies using DFT calculations and experiments indicate that a Lewis acid Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed mechanism is the likely pathway in the catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Colloidal Assembly Behavior Enables Printable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiple quantum wells (QWs) distribution in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films hinders charge transport due to the fundamental difficulty of controlling crystal growth from precursor solutions, yielding poorly homogeneous low&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially in upscaling fabrication. Here, efficient low&#8208;dimensional PSCs are realized by modulating the colloidal assembly behavior in the precursor solution to induce intermediate structures. In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved lead iodide&#8208;dominated colloidal soft framework is visualized by investigating the precursor species differences under hydrogen bonding interactions. Subsequently, solid&#8208;state reactions emerge and the formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite films exhibit significantly suppressed multiple QWs distribution. Encouragingly, the FA device (n = 9, by meniscus&#8208;assisted coating) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.28% for a size of 0.04 cm2 and a PCE of 15.35% for a mini&#8208;module of 16.94 cm2 with superior stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Abundant Chirality Inversion of Supramolecular Nanohelices by Multiply Manipulating the Binding Sites in Molecular Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple binding sites of biomolecules induced diverse chirality regulation is ubiquitous in nature and play an essential role in determining the biofunction of biosystems. However, mimicking this biological phenomenon and understand its mechanism from multiple binding sites at molecular level by establishing an artificial system still remains a challenge. Herein, the abundant chirality inversion is achieved by precisely and multiply manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives (D/LPPF) with different naphthalene derivatives (NA, NC, NP, NF). The amide and hydroxyl group of naphthalene derivatives prefer to bind with carboxyl of LPPF, while carboxylic and fluoride atom tend to bind with amide of LPPF. All these diverse interaction modes can precisely trigger the helicity inversion of LPPF nanofibers. In addition, synergistically manipulating the carboxyl and amide binding sites from a single LPPF molecule to simultaneously interact with different naphthalene derivatives is realized for chirality regulation. Typically, the variation of solvent may switch the interaction modes and the switched new interaction modes can be employed to further regulate the chirality of LPPF nanofibers. This study may provide a novel approach to explore the chirality diversity in artificial systems by regulating the intermolecular binding sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Detection of Trace Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoor detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration is necessary due to the serious toxicity hazards&#160;even at trace level. However, physisorbents usually exhibit weak interactions especially in the presence of trace concentrations of VOCs, thus exhibiting poor responsive signal. Herein, we report a new flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that exhibits interesting pore&#8208;opening behavior after immersing in H2O. The pore&#8208;opening phase shows significant (~116 folds) and extremely fast (&lt; 1 minute) fluorescence enhancement&#160;after being exposed to saturated benzene vapor. The limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor can be calculated as 0.133 mg L&#8208;1. Thus this material represents the first MOF to achieve visual detection of trace benzene vapor by the naked eyes. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure reveal that the special "bilateral &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking" interactions between the host and guest, which facilitate electron transfer and greatly enhance the intensity of fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Diffusion Limitation of Faradaic Processes: Property&#8208;Performance Relationships of 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 for Reversible Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Faradaic reactions including charge transfer are often accompanied with diffusion limitation inside the bulk. Conductive two&#8208;dimensional frameworks (2D MOFs) with a fast ion transport can combine both &#8208; charge transfer and fast diffusion inside their porous structure. To study remaining diffusion limitations caused by particle morphology, different synthesis routes of Cu&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu3(HHTP)2), a copper&#8208;based 2D MOF, are used to obtain flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like MOF particles. Both morphologies are systematically characterized and evaluated for redox&#8208;active Li+ ion storage. The redox mechanism is investigated by means of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ XRD. Both types are compared regarding kinetic properties for Li+ ion storage via cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. A significant influence of particle morphology for 2D MOFs on kinetic aspects of electrochemical Li+ ion storage can be observed. This study opens the path for optimization of redox active porous structures to overcome diffusion limitations of Faradaic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Thioethers as Dichotomous Electrophiles for Site&#8208;Selective Silylation via C&#8208;S Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of aryl alkyl sulfides as dichotomous electrophiles for site&#8208;selective silylation via C&#8208;S bond cleavage has been achieved. Iron&#8208;catalyzed selective cleavage of C(aryl)&#8208;S bonds can occur in the presence of &#946;&#8208;diketimine ligands, and the cleavage of C(alkyl)&#8208;S bonds can be achieved by t&#8208;BuONa without the use of transition metals, resulting in the corresponding silylated products in moderate to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that Fe&#8208;Si species may undergo metathesis reactions during the cleavage of C(aryl)&#8208;S bonds, while silyl radicals are involved during the cleavage of C(alkyl)&#8208;S bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Approach to Solution&#8208;Processible Small&#8208;Molecule Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters  for High &#8208;Performance Narrowband OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most multi&#8208;resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters generally exhibit strong aggregation and relatively worse solubility due to their rigid and planar molecule structures, which is highly undesirable for solution&#8208;processible devices. Herein, a simple but feasible approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule MR&#8208;TADF emitters is developed by incorporating two MR&#8208;TADF units onto carbazole bridge bearing long alkyl chains. The obtained emitters demonstrate supreme film&#8208;forming capability and narrowband emissions with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 22 nm. The resulting solution&#8208;processed narrowband electroluminescent devices achieve maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.1%, which represents the highest efficiency among the solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters. This simple approach reveals great potential of developing solution&#8208;processible emitters for rigid and planar molecular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfenate Anion Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aziridines are highly valued synthetic targets in organic and medicinal chemistry. The organocatalytic synthesis of such structures with broad substrate scope and good diastereoselectivity, however, is rare. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and diastereoselective synthetic method for the synthesis of trans&#8208;aziridines from imines and benzylic or alkyl halides utilizing sulfenate anions (PhSO&#8211;) as the catalyst. Substrates bearing heterocyclic aromatic groups, alkyl, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aryl groups were shown to be compatible with this method (33 examples), giving good yields and high diastereoselectivity (trans: cis &gt; 20:1). Further functionalization of aziridines containing cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl groups was achieved through ring&#8208;opening reactions, with a cyclobutyl&#8208;substituted norephedrine derivative obtained through a four&#8208;step synthesis. We offer a mechanistic proposal involving reversible addition of the deprotonated benzyl sulfoxide to the imine to explain the high trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Linker Dimensionality in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom Pore Control for Separation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with high surface areas, which are acquiring rapid attention on an exponential basis. A significant characteristic of MOFs is their ability to act as adsorbents to selectively separate component mixtures of similar size, thereby addressing the technological need for an alternative approach to conventional distillation methods. Recently, MOFs comprising a 3&#8208;Dimensional (3D) linker have shown outstanding capabilities for difficult separations compared to the parent 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) analogue. 3D&#8208;linkers with a polycyclic core are underrepresented in the MOF database due to the widespread preferred use of 2D&#8208;linkers and the misconceived high&#8208;cost of 3D linkers. We summarize the recent research of 3D&#8208;linker MOFs and highlight their beneficial employment for selective gas and hydrocarbon adsorption and separation. Furthermore, we outline forecasts in this area to create a platform for widespread adoption of 3D&#8208;linkers in MOF synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzil Derivatives for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials could revolutionize batteries because of their high energy densities, the use of Earth&#8208;abundant elements, and structural diversity, which allows fine&#8208;tuning of electrochemical properties. However, small organic molecules and intermediates formed during their redox cycling in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have high solubility in organic electrolytes, leading to rapid decay of cycling performance. We report the use of three cyclotetrabenzil octaketone macrocycles as cathode materials for LIBs. The rigid and insoluble naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil reversibly accepts eight electrons in a two&#8208;step process with a specific capacity of 279 mAh g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance with ~65% capacity retention after 135 cycles. DFT calculations indicate that its reduction increases both ring strain and ring rigidity, as demonstrated by computed high distortion energies, repulsive regions in NCI plots, and close [C&#183;&#183;&#183;C] contacts between the naphthalenes. This work highlights the importance of shape&#8208;persistency and ring strain in the design of redox&#8208;active macrocycles that maintain very low solubility in various redox states.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanobody Loop Mimetics Enhance Son of Sevenless 1&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleotide Exchange on RAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RAS proteins control various intracellular signaling networks. Mutations at specific locations were shown to stabilize their active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)&#8208;bound state, which is associated with the development of multiple cancers. An attractive approach to modulate RAS signaling is through its regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). With the recent discovery of Nanobody14 (Nb14), which potently enhances SOS1&#8208;catalyzed nucleotide exchange on RAS, we explored the feasibility of developing peptide mimetics by structurally mimicking the complementarity&#8208;determining region 3 (CDR3). Guided by a biochemical GEF assay and X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures, successive rounds of optimization and gradual conformational rigidification led to CDR3 mimetics showing half of the maximal activation potential of Nb14 with an EC50 value of 29 &#956;M. Altogether, this study demonstrated that peptides able to modulate a protein&#8208;protein interaction can be obtained by structural mimicry of a Nb paratope.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Carbon&#8208;Sequestrated Seawater into Stoichiometric CO and HClO with Nitrogen&#8208;Doped BiOCl Atomic Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seawater is one of the most important CO2 sequestration media for delivering value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels and active chlorine; however, this scenario is plagued by sluggish reaction rates and poor product selectivity. Herein, we first report the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers to directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater (Yellow Sea, China) into stoichiometric CO (92.8 &#181;mol h&#8208;1) and HClO (83.2 &#181;mol h&#8208;1) under visible light with selectivities greater than 90%. Photoelectrons enriched on the exposed BiOCl{001} facet kinetically facilitate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction via surface&#8208;doped nitrogen bearing Lewis basicity. Photoholes, mainly located on the lateral facets of van der Waals gaps, promote the selective oxidation of Cl&#8208; into HClO. Sequestrated CO2 also maintains the pH of seawater at around 4.2 to prevent the alkaline earth cations from precipitating. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships, offering a green and safe way for onsite sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Oxidative Degradation Mechanism of Solid Amine Sorbents for CO2 Capture from Air: Roles of Atmospheric Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct air capture (DAC) processes for extraction of CO2 from ambient air are unique among chemical processes in that they operate outdoors conditions with minimal feed pretreatments. Here, the impact of humidity on the oxidative degradation of a prototypical solid supported amine sorbent, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) supported on Al2O3, is explored in detail. By combining CO2 adsorption measurements, oxidative degradation rates, elemental analyses, solid&#8208;state NMR and in situ IR spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with 18O labeling of water, a comprehensive picture of sorbent oxidation is achieved under accelerated conditions. We demonstrated that the presence of water vapor can play an important role in accelerating the degradation reactions. From the study we inferred the identity and kinetics of formation of the major oxidative products, and the role(s) of humidity. Our data are consistent with a radical mediated autooxidative degradation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Active Cu2O/Copper Interface Sites for N&#8208;Formylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines with CO2/H2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;formylation of aliphatic primary amines with CO2/H2 to formamide is achieved with a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal Cu&#8208;based catalyst containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites.







Abstract
Heterogeneously catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamide with CO2/H2 is highly attractive for the valorization of CO2. However, the relationship of the catalytic performance with the catalyst structure is still elusive. Herein, mixed valence catalysts containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites were constructed for this transformation. Both aliphatic primary and secondary amines with diverse structures were efficiently converted into the desired formamides with good to excellent yields. Combined ex and in situ catalyst characterization revealed that the presence of Cu2O/Cu interface sites was vital for the excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that better catalytic activity of Cu2O/Cu(111) than Cu(111) is attributed to the assistance of oxygen at the Cu2O/Cu interface (Ointer) in formation of Ointer&#8208;H moieties, which not only reduce the apparent barrier of HCOOH formation but also benefit the desorption of the desired N&#8208;formylated amine, leading to high activity and selectivity.

         <title>A Fluid Multivalent Magnetic Interface for High&#8208;Performance Isolation and Proteomic Profiling of Tumor&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluid multivalent magnetic interface was engineered in a microfluidic chip to improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition for efficient isolation of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs). With the assistance of magnetic and flow fields, this interface balanced affinity, selectivity, reversibility, and extendibility, enabling high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for protein profiling.







Abstract
Isolation and analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs) are important for clinical cancer management. Here, we develop a fluid multivalent magnetic interface (FluidmagFace) in a microfluidic chip for high&#8208;performance isolation, release, and protein profiling of T&#8208;EVs. The FluidmagFace increases affinity by 105&#8208;fold with fluidity&#8208;enhanced multivalent binding to improve isolation efficiency by 13.9&#8201;% compared with a non&#8208;fluid interface. Its anti&#8208;adsorption property and microfluidic hydrodynamic shear minimize contamination, increasing detection sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its reversibility and expandability allow high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for mass spectrometric protein analysis. With the chip, T&#8208;EVs were detected in all tested cancer samples with identification of differentially expressed proteins compared with healthy controls. The FluidmagFace opens a new avenue to isolation and release of targets for cancer diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Reaction of Metal&#8208;Polarized Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzoxazinones with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides were developed under transition metal catalysis. Pharmaceutically significant bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, benzimidazolines and dibenzodiazepines, were produced with high efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, detailed mechanism studies were carried out to explain the proposed mechanism and reaction selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs) are a unique and efficient handle for azaheterocycle synthesis. Despite great achievements, the potential of these reactive intermediates has not yet been fully exploited, especially the new reaction modes. Herein, we disclosed an unprecedented dearomatization process of metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs, affording transient dearomatized spiroaziridine intermediates. Based on this serendipity, we accomplished three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzimidazolines with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides, enabling the divergent synthesis of bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles with high efficiency and flexibility. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to explain the proposed mechanisms and observed selectivity. Further cellular evaluation of the dibenzodiazepine products identified a hit compound for new antitumor drugs.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Azulene&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Knoevenagel&#8208;Type Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and modular method has been developed for the construction of novel azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with good structure versatility. The chemical structures, aromaticity, and photophysical properties of the synthesized non&#8208;alternant PAHs are fully investigated. This strategy provides straightforward access and rapid construction of unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs, and possibly graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.







Abstract
The research interest in azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has significantly increased recently, but the lack of efficient synthetic strategies impedes the investigation of their structure&#8208;property relationships and further opto&#8208;electronic applications. Here we report a modular synthetic strategy towards diverse azulene&#8208;embedded PAHs by a tandem Suzuki coupling and base&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel&#8208;type condensation with good yields and great structural versatility, including non&#8208;alternant thiophene&#8208;rich PAHs, butterfly&#8208; or Z&#8208;shaped PAHs bearing two azulene units, and the first example of a two&#8208;azulene&#8208;embedded double [5]helicene. The structural topology, aromaticity and photophysical properties were investigated by NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy assisted by DFT calculations. This strategy provides a new platform for rapidly synthesizing unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs or even graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbons in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) are promising candidates as oxygen electrocatalysts due to their low cost, tunable catalytic activity and selectivity, and well&#8208;dispersed morphologies. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of such systems, it is critical to gain a detailed understanding of their structure and properties through advanced characterization. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) serves as a powerful tool to probe both the active sites and structural evolution of catalytic materials under reaction conditions. In this review, we firstly provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of XAS and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are subsequently discussed in detail. Finally, major challenges and future opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

         <title>Interaction between Divalent Copper Fluoride and Carboxamide Group Enabling Stereoretentive Fluorination of Tertiary Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination reaction allowed to achieve the synthesis of molecules bearing F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Based on the use of enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;halocarboxamides and inexpensive CsF, the reaction could be controlled by efficient divalent&#8208;Cu/carboxamide interactions. This new methodology enables to generate the tert&#8208;alkyl fluorides in a stereoretentive manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination involving CsF and &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as tertiary alkyl sources that, unlike traditional stereospecific routes involving stereoinversive SN2 reactions, proceeds with retention of stereochemistry. The developed stereospecific Cu&#8208;catalyzed reaction is among the most efficient methods for synthesizing fluorinated molecules that possess highly congested stereogenic carbon centers. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combined reactivity of CuF2 and Cs salt is essential for completing the catalytic cycle. Our catalytic system underwent fluorination exclusively with tertiary alkyl bromides and did not react with primary alkyl bromides, indicating that this stereospecific fluorination methodology is suitable for synthesizing fluorinated building blocks possessing stereo&#8208;defined F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center.

         <title>Optochemical Control of mRNA Translation in Eukaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optochemically controlled biomolecules are a rapidly growing field that holds enormous promise for biological and therapeutic research. The growing need for therapeutic oligonucleotides and the recent success of mRNA as a therapeutic modality highlight the requirement for highly precise spatial and temporal regulation of nucleic acid activities at the post&#8208;transcriptional level.







Abstract
A major stage in the expression of genes is the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), and the regulation of this process is essential for protein production in cells. How tightly controlled gene expression can be spatially and temporally, is particularly evident in polar cells and embryonic development. We need tools to dissect these complex processes, if we wish to understand the underlying links, especially the difficulties brought on by malfunction. External bioorthogonal triggers are very helpful in this area, if they let us precisely control where and when a process is started. Equipping nucleic acids with light&#8208;responsive groups has proven to be an effective approach to examine the dynamic regulatory route of mRNA translation in living cells. In this review, we present an overview of the most recent methods for optochemically controlling translation, focusing on cis&#8208;acting technologies.

         <title>Origin of Surface Reconstruction in Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism Based&#8208;Transition Metal Oxides: A Spontaneous Chemical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface reconstruction of Lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based metal oxides in alkaline medium was unveiled to be triggered by a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the activated lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules firstly, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;). Then, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface.







Abstract
A fundamental understanding of surface reconstruction process is pivotal to developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is believed as an irreversible oxygen redox behavior, due to the much slower rate of OH&#8722; refilling than that of oxygen vacancy formation. Here, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;). Subsequently, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface. This work also suggests that the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity could accelerate the surface reconstruction process. Hence, such a finding could add a new layer for the understanding of surface reconstruction mechanism.

         <title>Contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis for Direct Synthesis of H2O2 under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to prepare H2O2 in a green, safe, simple and efficient way under ambient conditions. We proposed a facile approach for the direct production of H2O2, relying on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis between Polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water without any other traditional catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an indispensable basic reagent in various industries, such as textile bleach, chemical synthesis, and environmental protection. However, it is challenging to prepare H2O2 in a green, safe, simple and efficient way under ambient conditions. Here, we found that H2O2 could be synthesized using a catalytic pathway only by contact charging a two&#8208;phase interface at room temperature and normal pressure. Particularly, under the action of mechanical force, electron transfer occurs during physical contact between polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water/O2 interfaces, inducing the generation of reactive free radicals (&#8901;OH and &#8901;O2&#8722; ), and the free radicals could react to form H2O2, yielding as high as 313&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. In addition, the new reaction device could show long&#8208;term stable H2O2 production. This work provides a novel method for the efficient preparation of H2O2, which may also stimulate further explorations on contact&#8208;electrification&#8208;induced chemistry process.

         <title>Lipophilicity Modulations by Fluorination Correlate with Membrane Partitioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state 19F MAS&#8197;NMR method was developed to accurately and easily measure water&#8208;membrane partitioning values (Kp). Given the very different octanol and membrane environments, a remarkable correlation between logKp and logP was found, but only for a given compound series. This work indicates that even minor lipophilicity modulations by aliphatic fluorination can have true relevance for the drug discovery optimization process.







Abstract
Bioactive compounds generally need to cross membranes to arrive at their site of action. The octanol&#8208;water partition coefficient (lipophilicity, logPOW) has proven to be an excellent proxy for membrane permeability. In modern drug discovery, logPOW and bioactivity are optimized simultaneously, for which fluorination is one of the relevant strategies. The question arises as to which extent the often subtle logP modifications resulting from different aliphatic fluorine&#8208;motif introductions also lead to concomitant membrane permeability changes, given the difference in molecular environment between octanol and (anisotropic) membranes. It was found that for a given compound class, there is excellent correlation between logPOW values with the corresponding membrane molar partitioning coefficients (logKp); a study enabled by novel solid&#8208;state 19F NMR MAS methodology using lipid vesicles. Our results show that the factors that cause modulation of octanol&#8208;water partition coefficients similarly affect membrane permeability.

         <title>Precise Epitope Organization with Self&#8208;adjuvant Framework Nucleic Acid for Efficient COVID&#8208;19 Peptide Vaccine Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs)&#8208;based peptide vaccines with different structures and sizes were constructed to understand the effect of peptide spacing and carrier rigidity on B&#8197;cell activation, and reveal the significance of precise peptide organization. Epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were assembled on the preferred FNA to construct a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine prototype which effectively triggered humoral immune responses in mice.







Abstract
Peptide vaccines have advantages in easy fabrication and high safety, but their effectiveness is hampered by the poor immunogenicity of the epitopes themselves. Herein, we constructed a series of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) with regulated rigidity and size to precisely organize epitopes in order to reveal the influence of epitope spacing and carrier rigidity on the efficiency of peptide vaccines. We found that assembling epitopes on rigid tetrahedral FNAs (tFNAs) with the appropriate size could efficiently enhance their immunogenicity. Further, by integrating epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on preferred tFNAs, we constructed a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine which could induce high titers of IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and increase the ratio of memory B and T cells in mice. Considering the good biocompatibility of tFNAs, our research provides a new idea for developing efficient peptide vaccines against viruses and possibly other diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Induced Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Copper Nanoclusters Using DNA Nanoribbon Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of self&#8208;assembly induced enhanced electrochemiluminescence (SIEECL) using programmable DNA nanoribbon was proposed for the first time. This novel concept is confirmed in various ECL emitters, such as copper nanoclusters, gold nanoclusters and Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Accelerated electron transfer reaction and reduced energy gap contribute to the enhancement of ECL.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are attractive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters as Cu is comparatively inexpensive, nontoxic, and highly abundant. However, their ECL yield is relatively low. Herein, we report that orderly self&#8208;assembly of CuNCs using DNA nanoribbon as the template (DNR/CuNCs) conferred the CuNCs with improved ECL properties compared with individual CuNCs in both annihilation and co&#8208;reactant processes. The DNR/CuNCs resulted in a high ECL yield of 46.8&#8201;% in K2S2O8, which was &#8776;68 times higher than that of individual CuNCs. This strategy was successfully extended to other ECL emitters, such as gold nanoclusters and the Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Furthermore, as an application of DNR/CuNCs, a DNR/CuNC&#8208;based ECL biosensor with higher sensitivity was constructed for dopamine determination (two orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported), showing that DNR/CuNCs have a potential for application in ECL bioanalysis as a new type of superior luminophore candidate.

         <title>Linear and Bent Cp*2Si: Reversible Phase Transition of a Key Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organometallic lighthouse molecule Cp*2SiII was always the odd out from the heavier homologues. In the solid&#8208;state counterintuitively there is a linear molecule next to two bent ones. While the latter is more stable, the linear conformer was mainly attributed to fuzzy packing effects. Now it is clear that the linearity has to be assigned to entropy in the room temperature phase while the bending is due to dispersion of the rings in the 80&#8197;K phase.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;state structure of decamethylsilicocene Cp*2Si with a bent and a linear molecule in the same unit cell was so far considered an exception in relation to the structures of its all&#8208;bent heavier analogues Cp*2E with E=Ge, Sn, Pb. Here, we present the solution to this conundrum by reporting a low&#8208;temperature phase, where all three symmetrically independent molecules are present in a bent formation. This reversible enantiotropic phase transition occurs in the temperature range between 80&#8197;K and 130&#8197;K and provides a rationale for the unexpected linear molecule based in entropy beyond hand&#8208;waving explanations such as electronic reasons or packing effects.

         <title>Revealing the Interfacial Chemistry of Fluoride Alkyl Magnesium Salts in Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts reconstructing the solvation structure of Mg2+ not only improves the high voltage tolerance of the electrolyte, but also facilitates in situ generation robust solid electrolyte interface enabling steady Mg metal anode.







Abstract
Exploring promising electrolyte&#8208;system with high reversible Mg plating/stripping and excellent stability is essential for rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs). Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts (Mg(ORF)2) not only possess high solubility in ether solvents but also compatible with Mg metal anode, thus holding a vast application prospect. Herein, a series of diverse Mg(ORF)2 were synthesized, among them, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol magnesium (Mg(PFTB)2)/AlCl3/MgCl2 based electrolyte demonstrates highest oxidation stability, and promotes the in situ formation of robust solid electrolyte interface. Consequently, the fabricated symmetric cell sustains a long&#8208;term cycling over 2000&#8197;h, and the asymmetric cell exhibits a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% over 3000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the Mg||Mo6S8 full cell maintains a stable cycling over 500&#8197;cycles. This work presents guidance for understanding structure&#8211;property relationships and electrolyte applications of fluoride alkyl magnesium salts.

         <title>Reactivity of Glutaconamides Within [2]Rotaxanes: Mechanical Bond Controlled Chemoselective Synthesis of Highly Reactive &#945;&#8208;KetoAmides and their Light&#8208;Triggered Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical interlocking of glutaconamides is crucial for their chemoselective oxidation to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. These unprecedented species were satisfactorily employed in blue&#8208;light&#8208;driven cyclizations to divergently provide hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;azetidinones or oxazolidinones through two modes of the Norrish/Yang type&#8208;II reaction. This behavior starkly differs from that of the non&#8208;interlocked substrates under the same reaction conditions.







Abstract
Glutaconamide&#8208;based [2]rotaxanes are efficiently oxidized to the respective interlocked &#945;&#8208;ketoamides, whereas their non&#8208;interlocked threads afford hydroxycyclohexene tetraamides under similar reaction conditions. These results showcase the mechanically interlocking of highly reactive substrates as a powerful tool for controlling their chemical behavior. Inside the macrocycle and under irradiation with light, the &#945;&#8208;ketoamide threads convert, in a divergent manner, into the corresponding interlocked hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams or oxazolidinones by two modes of Norrish/Yang type&#8208;II intramolecular cyclizations, processes that are efficiently chemocontrolled by the mechanical bond.

Racemic (R)/(S) and enantiopure (D,R,D)/(L,S,L) binuclear PtII complexes with metal&#8208;induced planar chirality were designed and prepared by using soft&#8208;bridged achiral and chiral ligands, respectively. Their phosphorescence quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% can be achieved by shortening intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distance for highly efficient solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized OLEDs.







Abstract
PtII complexes have attracted a great deal of interest due to their rich phosphorescent properties. However, these square&#8208;planar PtII complexes are far more likely to encounter the problems of lack of metal&#8208;induced chirality and emission &#8220;aggregation&#8208;caused quenching&#8221;. Herein, soft&#8208;bridged binuclear PtII complexes bearing metal&#8208;induced planar chirality were synthesized and characterized. These soft bridging ligands with smaller conjugated system would help to not only improve solubility for synthesis and enantioseparation but also introduce point chirality from amino acid for highly efficient diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, the intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distances could be well regulated by soft bridging ligands, and consequently the phosphorescence quantum yield up to 100&#8201;% could be achieved by shortening intramolecular Pt&#8722;Pt distance for first time. These complexes can be used as emitters in highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallacages and Their Supramolecular Catalysis Behaviors in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined metallacages in microdroplets was achieved through a continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic approach. The high efficiency and diversity of this strategy were illustrated by the generation of five representative metallacages with nearly quantitative yields in a few minutes. This approach is promising for the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular systems in a confined space.







Abstract
Developing a new strategy to improve the self&#8208;assembly efficiency of functional assemblies in a confined space and construct hybrid functional materials is a significant and fascinating endeavor. Herein, we present a highly efficient strategy for achieving the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined metallacages in microdroplets through continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices. The high efficiency and versatility of this approach are demonstrated by the generation of five representative metallacages in different solvents containing water, DMF, acetonitrile, and methanol in a few minutes with nearly quantitative yields, in contrast to the yields obtained with the hour&#8208;scale reaction time in a batch reactor. A ring&#8208;opening catalytic reaction of the metallacages was selected as a model reaction for exploring supramolecular catalysis in microdroplets, whereby the catalytic yield was enhanced by 2.22&#8208;fold compared to that of the same reaction in the batch reactor. This work illustrates a new promising approach for the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular systems.

         <title>Organic pH Buffer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic pH buffer strategy is proposed. N&#8208;containing organic molecules simultaneously control electrolyte pH, suppress hydrogen evolution, enable uniform Zn deposition, and inhibit shuttle of polyiodine compounds, achieving highly reversible and stable, long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine (I2) batteries are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, drawbacks include, Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion and, cathode &#8220;shuttle&#8221; of polyiodines. Here we report a class of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds as organic pH buffers to obviate these. We evidence that addition of pyridine /imidazole regulates electrolyte pH, and inhibits HER and anode corrosion. In addition, pyridine and imidazole preferentially absorb on Zn metal, regulating non&#8208;dendritic Zn plating /stripping, and achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;% and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3200&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It is also confirmed that pyridine inhibits polyiodines shuttling and boosts conversion kinetics for I&#8722;/I2. As a result, the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery exhibits long cycle stability of &gt;25&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and high specific capacity of 105.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We conclude organic pH buffer engineering is practical for dendrite&#8208;free and shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Efficient Ion Gating through Self&#8208;Assembled Two&#8208;Dimensional Photothermal Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane is shown to be an excellent nanofluidic platform for the smart regulation of transverse ion transport. It exhibits extremely high ion gating ratios (up to 104) due to its good photothermal performance. This approach may lead to applications of MOF membranes which have a variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.







Abstract
Biological ion channels regulate the ion flow across cell membrane via opening or closing of the pores in response to various external stimuli. Replicating the function of high ion gating effects with artificial porous materials has been challenging. Herein, we report that the self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane can serve as an excellent nanofluidic platform for smart regulation of ion transport. The MOF membrane with good photothermal performance exhibits extremely high ion gating ratio (up to 104), which is among the highest values in MOF membrane nanochannels for light&#8208;controlled ion gating reported so far. By repeatedly turning on and off the light, the nanofluidic device shows outstanding stability and reversibility that can be applied in the remote light&#8208;switching system. This work may spark promising applications of MOF membrane with variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.

         <title>Loading of Amino Acids onto RNA in a Putative RNA&#8208;Peptide World</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The loading of RNAs with amino acids constitutes the first step toward RNA&#8208;based peptide synthesis in a putative prebiotic RNA&#8208;peptide world. The efficient loading of RNA strands incorporating N&#8208;methylcarbamoyl nucleotides with a series of amino acids is reported. The loaded RNA strands also underwent RNA&#8208;based amino acid transfer reactions.







Abstract
RNA is a molecule that can both store genetic information and perform catalytic reactions. This observed dualism places RNA into the limelight of concepts about the origin of life. The RNA world concept argues that life started from self&#8208;replicating RNA molecules, which evolved toward increasingly complex structures. Recently, we demonstrated that RNA, with the help of conserved non&#8208;canonical nucleosides, which are also putative relics of an early RNA world, had the ability to grow peptides covalently connected to RNA nucleobases, creating RNA&#8208;peptide chimeras. It is conceivable that such molecules, which combined the information&#8208;coding properties of RNA with the catalytic potential of amino acid side chains, were once the structures from which life emerged. Herein, we report prebiotic chemistry that enabled the loading of both nucleosides and RNAs with amino acids as the first step toward RNA&#8208;based peptide synthesis in a putative RNA&#8208;peptide world.

         <title>Graphene Mediates Charge Transfer between Lead Chromate and a Cobalt Cubane Cocatalyst for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially oxidized graphene (pGO) operates as a charge&#8208;transfer mediator between the water oxidation cocatalyst (Co4O4) and the hole&#8208;accumulating {&#8722;101} facets of PbCrO4. Unimpeded transfer of photogenerated holes from PbCrO4 to Co4O4 via the pGO mediator is demonstrated. The resulting Co4O4/pGO/PbCrO4 photocatalyst oxidizes water with an apparent quantum efficiency exceeding 10&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The interfacial barrier of charge transfer from semiconductors to cocatalysts means that the photogenerated charges cannot be fully utilized, especially for the challenging water oxidation reaction. Using cobalt cubane molecules (Co4O4) as water oxidation cocatalysts, we rationally assembled partially oxidized graphene (pGO), acting as a charge&#8208;transfer mediator, on the hole&#8208;accumulating {&#8722;101} facets of lead chromate (PbCrO4) crystal. The assembled pGO enables preferable immobilization of Co4O4 molecules on the {&#8722;101} facets of the PbCrO4 crystal, which is favorable for the photogenerated holes transferring from PbCrO4 to Co4O4 molecules. The surface charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of PbCrO4 was boosted by selective assembly of pGO between PbCrO4 and Co4O4 molecules. An apparent quantum efficiency for photocatalytic water oxidation on the Co4O4/pGO/PbCrO4 photocatalyst exceeded 10&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm. This strategy of rationally assembling charge&#8208;transfer mediator provides a feasible method for acceleration of charge transfer and utilization in semiconductor photocatalysis.

         <title>A Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Unique Aromatic Pore Surfaces for High Performance C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces, suitable pore spaces and pore volumes, Ni&#8208;MOF 2 displays high separation performance for C2H6/C2H4 separation and produces polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 with high&#8208;productivity (12&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1) by a single separation process.







Abstract
Developing adsorptive separation processes based on C2H6&#8208;selective sorbents to replace energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation is a promising alternative for C2H4 purification from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures, which however remains challenging. During our studies on two isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOF 1 and Ni&#8208;MOF 2), we found that Ni&#8208;MOF 2 exhibited significantly higher performance for C2H6/C2H4 separation than Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, as clearly established by gas sorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments. Density&#8208;Functional Theory (DFT) studies showed that the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces within Ni&#8208;MOF 2 induce more and stronger C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; with C2H6 over C2H4 while the suitable pore spaces enforce its high C2H6 uptake capacity, featuring Ni&#8208;MOF 2 as one of the best porous materials for this very important gas separation. It generates 12&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 product from equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at ambient conditions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes with Joined Nonhexagons via a Ring Expansion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, novel nanographenes bearing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs were synthesized through a facile ring expansion strategy. Modifications of heptagon spacers have endowed N&#8208;doped nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties. This ring expansion method was further explored to synthesize diverse N&#8208;doped nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs, demonstrating the high efficiency of the proposed method.







Abstract
Synthetic methodology is considered a holy grail in both organic chemistry and materials science. Over the past few decades, researchers have explored graphene&#8208;type molecules (or nanographenes) through classic Scholl oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. Despite the successes achieved with various nanographenes, the development of new methods to synthesize these highly desired molecules lags behind. Herein, we developed a facile and effective method to produce a series of nanographenes bearing nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in acceptable yields. Modification of the heptagonal ring endowed the resultant nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties; for instance, M9 exhibited both aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Most strikingly, novel nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs were also obtained using the same synthetic strategy, demonstrating the superior versatility and efficiency of the proposed ring expansion method.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Initiated Radical/Polar Crossover Annulation Cascade for Expedient Access to Complex Tetralins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical/polar crossover manifold permits annulations between allylarenes and Giese&#8208;type accepters, providing a route to functionalized tetralins. The reaction conditions are mild and therefore exhibit significant functional group tolerance. The annulation products are formally cycloadducts of styrenes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, and they can be used to form a variety of strained ring products.







Abstract
A radical/polar crossover annulation between allyl&#8208;substituted arenes and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is described. Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) facilitates tandem radical C&#8722;C bond formation that generates functionalized tetralin products in the face of potentially problematic hydrofluorination, hydroalkoxylation, hydrogenation, alkene isomerization, and radical polymerization reactions. The reactions proceed under mild conditions that tolerate many functional groups, leading to a broad substrate scope. This powerful ring&#8208;forming reaction very quickly assembles complex tetralins that are the formal products of the largely infeasible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions of styrenes.

         <title>Fast Isomerization Before Isomerization&#8208;Hydroformylation: Probing the Neglected Period with A Novel Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to limits in heat and mass transfer, the acquisition of kinetic data of fast reactions have been historically challenging, especially for multiphasic reactions. Inspired by the concept of flash chemistry and radial synthesis, a novel microreactor was designed to study the initial fast isomerization process (within the first minute) in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation. A new type of isomerization pathway without the coordination of CO to rhodium center was found, which is dramatically faster than the known one.







Abstract
By combining the concept of flash chemistry and radial synthesis, a novel microreactor (Flashstop reactor) was designed to study isomerization process of hydroformylation by a Rh/tetraphosphite catalyst in a time scale of seconds. It was found that in the initial 313&#8197;seconds, 60&#8211;99&#8201;% of 1&#8208;octene was isomerized to 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;octenes before the formation of aldehydes. Within this period, two different types of isomerization reactions were observed. It was proposed that a monohydride complex without CO ligand accounts for the ultrafast isomerization in the initial 30&#8197;seconds. The isomerization rate with such monohydride species was calculated much faster than that with the well&#8208;known H(CO)Rh(P&#8722;P) species. Both experimental and DFT computational studies were carried out to support this assumption. Fast transformations early on in catalytic cycles have been rarely studied due to the lack of proper tools. We believe that the Flashstop reactor is a powerful tool for analysis of kinetics in gas&#8208;liquid biphasic reactions within a time scale of seconds to minutes.

Within this period, two different types of isomerization reactions were observed. It was proposed that a monohydride complex without CO ligand accounts for the ultrafast isomerization in the initial 30&#8197;seconds. The isomerization rate with such monohydride species was calculated much faster than that with the well-known H(CO)Rh(P&#8722;P) species. Both experimental and DFT computational studies were carried out to support this assumption. Fast transformations early on in catalytic cycles have been rarely studied due to the lack of proper tools. We believe that the Flashstop reactor is a powerful tool for analysis of kinetics in gas-liquid biphasic reactions within a time scale of seconds to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimer Acceptor Adopting a Flexible Linker for Efficient and Durable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimer acceptor with flexible linker was designed and synthesized, which can not only act as the third component to enhance the intermolecular packing, but also stabilize the morphology by suppressing the molecular diffusion. As a result, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO based organic solar cells exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 18.41&#8201;% with excellent thermal/photo stability and mechanical performance.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have advanced rapidly due to the development of new photovoltaic materials. However, the long&#8208;term stability of OSCs still poses a severe challenge for their commercial deployment. To address this issue, a dimer acceptor (dT9TBO) with flexible linker is developed for incorporation into small&#8208;molecule acceptors to form molecular alloy with enhanced intermolecular packing and suppressed molecular diffusion to stabilize active layer morphology. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO&#8208;based device displays an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.41&#8201;% with excellent thermal stability and negligible decay after being aged at 65 &#176;C for 1800&#8197;h. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;dT9TBO&#8208;based flexible OSC also exhibits excellent mechanical durability, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial PCE after being bended repetitively for 1500&#8197;cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to fine&#8208;tune the molecular packing with stabilized morphology to overcome the trade&#8208;off between OSC efficiency and stability.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropanes from Carbon Pronucleophiles and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for diastereoselective cyclopropanation from unactivated alkenes and acidic carbon pronucleophiles is reported. The method is scalable and amenable to synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are desirable structural motifs with valuable applications in drug discovery and beyond. Established alkene cyclopropanation methods give rise to cyclopropanes with a limited array of substituents, are difficult to scale, or both. Herein, we disclose a new cyclopropane synthesis through the formal coupling of abundant carbon pronucleophiles and unactivated alkenes. This strategy exploits dicationic adducts derived from electrolysis of thianthrene in the presence of alkene substrates. We find that these dielectrophiles undergo cyclopropanation with methylene pronucleophiles via alkenyl thianthrenium intermediates. This protocol is scalable, proceeds with high diastereoselectivity, and tolerates diverse functional groups on both the alkene and pronucleophile coupling partners. To validate the utility of this new procedure, we prepared an array of substituted analogs of an established cyclopropane that is en route to multiple pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydroxyacid Potassium Synergists as an Efficient In Situ Defect Passivator for High Performance Tin&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on SnO2 electron transport layers have attracted extensive research due to their compelling photovoltaic performance. Herein, we presented an in situ passivation of SnO2 with low&#8208;cost hydroxyacid potassium synergist during deposition to optimize interface carrier extraction and transport&#160;of PSCs for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stabilities. The orbital overlap of the carboxyl oxygen with the Sn atom alongwith the nano particle depositon effectively suppresses the interfacial defects and releases the internal residual strains in the perovskite. Accordingly, a PCE of 24.91% and fill factor (FF) up to 0.852 of in situ passivated devices are obtained, which is one of the highest values for SnO2&#8208;based&#160;PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained 80% of its initial PCE at 80&#176;C over 600h, 100% PCE after aging at ambient conditions for 1300h, and 98% after one week under maximum&#160;power point tracking (MPPT) of continuous AM1.5G illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Organic&#8208;Cation Defects on Optoelectronic Properties of ASnI3 Perovskites A=HC(NH2)2, CH3NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve higher power conversion efficiency for tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites the critical role of organic defects in nonradiative recombination should be better understood. Random rotation of organic cation can suppress nonradiative carrier trapping owing to organic defects in FASnI3 [FA=HC(NH2)2], rendering the organic contributions for defect tolerance. In contrast, organic defects in MASnI3 (MA=CH3NH3) are strong and active trapping centers.







Abstract
Tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (tin OIHPs) possess a desirable band gap and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14&#8201;%. A commonly held view is that the organic cations in tin OIHPs would have little impact on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we show that the defective organic cations with randomly dynamic characteristics can have marked effect on optoelectronic properties of the tin OIHPs. Hydrogen vacancies originated from the proton dissociation from FA [HC(NH2)2] in FASnI3 can induce deep transition levels in the band gap but yield relatively small nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;15&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas those from MA (CH3NH3) in MASnI3 can yield much larger nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;11&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Additional insight into the &#8220;defect tolerance&#8221; is gained by disentangling the correlations between dynamic rotation of organic cations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Amides Enabled by 5&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Bipyridine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mere introduction of a CF3 group at position&#8197;5 of a bipyridine ligand promotes a dramatic change in regioselectivity in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylation of benzamides and derivatives, from meta/para to ortho&#8208;substitution. Computational and experimental data suggest that this effect is associated with unusual outer&#8208;sphere dispersion interactions between the carbonyl group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;bipy ring of the ligand.







Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylations of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds are highly attractive transformations because of the diversification possibilities offered by the resulting boronates. These transformations are best carried out using bidentate bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands, and tend to be governed by steric factors, therefore resulting in the competitive functionalization of meta and/or para positions. We have now discovered that a subtle change in the bipyridine ligand, namely, the introduction of a CF3 substituent at position&#8197;5, enables a complete change of regioselectivity in the borylation of aromatic amides, allowing the synthesis of a wide variety of ortho&#8208;borylated derivatives. Importantly, thorough computational studies suggest that the exquisite regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity stems from unusual outer&#8208;sphere interactions between the amide group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;substituted aryl ring of the bipyridine ligand.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iridium-catalyzed borylations of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds are highly attractive transformations because of the diversification possibilities offered by the resulting boronates. These transformations are best carried out using bidentate bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands, and tend to be governed by steric factors, therefore resulting in the competitive functionalization of &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; positions. We have now discovered that a subtle change in the bipyridine ligand, namely, the introduction of a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substituent at position&#8197;5, enables a complete change of regioselectivity in the borylation of aromatic amides, allowing the synthesis of a wide variety of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-borylated derivatives. Importantly, thorough computational studies suggest that the exquisite regio- and chemoselectivity stems from unusual outer-sphere interactions between the amide group of the substrate and the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-substituted aryl ring of the bipyridine ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the introduction of enzyme&#8208;responsive units in aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), enzyme&#8208;activatable SNAs can be constructed to mediate the connection between an enzyme biomarker and proteins of interest (POI) and enable cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective POI capture and translocation regulation. The enzyme&#8208;control strategy is expandable to regulate diverse POI with flexible aptamer design.







Abstract
Precise regulation of protein activity and localization in cancer cells is crucial to dissect the function of the protein&#8208;involved cellular network in tumorigenesis, but there is a lack of suitable methodology. Here we report the design of enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids (E&#8208;SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer&#8208;cell selectivity. The E&#8208;SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer&#8208;based modules bearing enzyme&#8208;responsive units in predesigned sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E&#8208;SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic&#8208;to&#8208;nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while they remain inactive in normal cells due to insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme&#8208;modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer&#8208;based design.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Polythiophene Derivative with Excellent Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring conjugated polymer is developed by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of polythiophene backbone. The resultant polymer shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels and highly ordered crystallite structure, leading to excellent thermoelectric performance after n&#8208;doping.







Abstract
Typical n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are based on fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;accepting building blocks. Herein, we report a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring strategy to design n&#8208;type conjugated polymers, i.e. introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring polythiophene backbone. The resulting polymer, n&#8208;PT1, shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of &#8722;3.91&#8197;eV/&#8722;6.22&#8197;eV, high electron mobility of 0.39&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and high crystallinity in thin film. After n&#8208;doping, n&#8208;PT1 exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance with an electrical conductivity of 61.2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor (PF) of 141.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This PF is the highest value reported so far for n&#8208;type conjugated polymers and this is the first time for polythiophene derivatives to be used in n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics. The excellent thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;PT1 is due to its superior tolerance to doping. This work indicates that polythiophene derivatives without fused rings are low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

         <title>Pretrichodermamide A Biosynthesis Reveals the Hidden Diversity of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic route of fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) was revealed by elucidating the biosynthesis of pretrichodermamide A. Diverse ETP derivatives, including 25 novel compounds, were characterized from tda gene deletion mutants, indicating divergent metabolic pathways of ETP intermediates and enzyme catalytic promiscuity.







Abstract
Fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) possess large structural diversity and complexity due to modifications of the cyclodipeptide skeleton. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pretrichodermamide A (1) in Trichoderma hypoxylon revealed a flexible catalytic machinery of multiple enzymes for generating ETP diversity. Seven tailoring enzymes encoded by the tda cluster are involved in 1 biosynthesis, that is, four P450s TdaB and TdaQ for 1,2&#8208;oxazine formation, TdaI for C7&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation, and TdaG for C4, C5&#8208;epoxidation, two methyltransferases TdaH for C6&#8242;&#8208; and TdaO for C7&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation, and a reductase TdaD for furan opening. Gene deletions led to the identification of 25 novel ETPs, including 20 shunt products, indicating the catalytic promiscuity of Tda enzymes. Particularly, TdaG and TdaD accept various substrates and catalyze regiospecific reactions at different stages of 1 biosynthesis. Our study not only uncovers a hidden library of ETP alkaloids, but also helps to understand the hidden chemical diversity of natural products by pathway manipulation.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazinones Enabled by Benzilic Amide Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of enantioselective benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones have been developed. The reaction proceeds via a high ordered sequence of imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;aza shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step.







Abstract
An unprecedent asymmetric catalytic benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones is reported. The reaction proceeds via a domino [4+1] imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;nitrogen shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration sequence, employing readily available vicinal tricarbonyl compounds and 1,2&#8208;diamines as starting materials. This approach provides an efficient access to chiral C3&#8208;disubsituted piperazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with high enantiocontrol, which are exceedingly difficult to access from the existing synthetic methodologies. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step. The resulting densely functionalized products are versatile building blocks to bioactive natural products, drug molecules and their analogues.

         <title>Somalactams A&#8211;D: Anti&#8208;inflammatory Macrolide Lactams with Unique Ring Systems from an Arctic Actinomycete Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new macrolide lactams, which were biosynthesized by a novel gene cluster sml, were isolated from an Arctic actinomycete strain. Multiple structural elucidation approaches were integrated to determine their structures. One of the compounds was found to inhibit IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It inhibited the MAPK pathway and significantly protected zebrafish from LPS&#8208;induced inflammation.







Abstract
Four new PKS&#8208;NRPS&#8208;derived macrolide lactams with three unique ring fusion types were discovered from the Arctic sponge associated actinomycete Streptomyces somaliensis 1107 using a genome mining strategy. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of MS, NMR spectroscopic analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Biosynthetically, a novel gene cluster sml consisting of three polyketide synthases and one hybrid polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase together with cytochrome P450s and flavin&#8208;containing monooxygenases and oxidoreductases was demonstrated to assemble the unique skeleton. Pharmacological studies revealed that compound 1 displayed a potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effect without cytotoxicity. It inhibited IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 0.18&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, and modulated the MAPK pathway. Moreover, compound 1 alleviated LPS&#8208;induced systemic inflammation in our transgenic fluorescent zebrafish model.

         <title>Molecular Lanthanide Switches for Magnetism and Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The common organic donor solvent tetrahydrofuran readily replaces the labile cyclononatetraenyl anion from the coordination sphere of trivalent lanthanide ions. Accordingly, [(C9H9)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)] sandwich complexes reversibly form [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)][(C9H9)] species upon solvent coordination. Depending on the complexed lanthanide ion, this drastic modulation of the coordination environment can be exploited to switch the photoluminescence properties (Ce, Tb) or magnetic behaviour (Nd, Er) of the parent complex.







Abstract
Solvation of [(CNT)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd, Tb, Er; CNT=cyclononatetraenyl, i.e., C9H9&#8722;; COT=cyclooctatetraendiid, i.e., C8H82&#8722;) complexes with tetrahydrofuran (THF) gives rise to neutral [(&#951;4&#8208;CNT)Ln(thf)2(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce) and ionic [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;COT)][CNT] (x=4 (Ce, Nd, Tb), 3 (Er)) species in a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation. Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single&#8208;molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self&#8208;sufficient switching process of the Ce(III) analogue in a spatially resolved manner.

         <title>Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity in the Zirconium Acid Triphosphate ZrH5(PO4)3
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a new crystalline acid Zr triphosphate which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in anhydrous conditions (relative humiditiy, RH, &#8810;1&#8201;%). This value of anhydrous proton conductivity is unprecedented and could unlock applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.







Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state proton conductors with high proton conductivity at low temperatures is crucial for the implementation of hydrogen&#8208;based technologies for portable and automotive applications. Here, we report on the discovery of a new crystalline metal acid triphosphate, ZrH5(PO4)3 (ZP3), which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous conditions. This is the highest anhydrous proton conductivity ever reported in a crystalline solid proton conductor in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C. Superprotonic conductivity in ZP3 is enabled by extended defective frustrated hydrogen bond chains, where the protons are dynamically disordered over two oxygen centers. The high proton conductivity and stability in anhydrous conditions make ZP3 an excellent candidate for innovative applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Double [9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene D9H with D2 symmetry has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;=18&#8201;%) in the near&#8208;infrared region and notable dissymmetry factor (gCD=0.019) in the visible region.







Abstract
Double helicenes are appealing chiral frameworks. Their &#960;&#8208;extension is desirable to achieve (chir)optical response in the visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, but access to higher double [n]helicenes (n&#8805;8) has remained challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene (D9H), unambiguously revealing its structure by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H shows remarkable NIR emission from 750 to 1100&#8197;nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 18&#8201;%. In addition, optically pure D9H exhibits panchromatic circular dichroism with a notable dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 0.019 at 590&#8197;nm, which is among the highest in the visible region for reported helicenes.

An efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction was discovered using a graph&#8208;based genetic algorithm. The catalytic activity was experimentally verified by a kinetic study and the newly discovered catalyst outcompetes a widely used catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
We present a de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction by searching chemical space for molecules that lower the estimated barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step using a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from randomly selected tertiary amines. We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessibility and have predicted rate&#8208;determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One suggested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.

         <title>The Self&#8208;Association of the KRAS4b Protein is Altered by Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Composition and Electrostatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of the peripheral membrane protein KRAS4b promotes oncogenic signaling. Using nanodiscs to enable paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments, we show that KRAS4b dimers associate through distinct conformations depending on lipid composition. Both states involve the &#945;4&#8208;&#945;5 interface, however increasing phosphatidylserine concentration alters the relative protomer orientation, shifting R135 electrostatic interactions from D153 to E168.







Abstract
KRAS is a peripheral membrane protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways, and is mutated in &#8776;30&#8201;% of cancers. Transient self&#8208;association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self&#8208;assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self&#8208;association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the &#8220;&#945;4/5&#8208;&#945;4/5&#8221; interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge&#8208;reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.

         <title>Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation with MFU&#8208;4&#8201;and Selectivity Reversal via Postsynthetic Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFU&#8208;4 shows high selectivity for adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 owing to a large activation energy for C2H2 diffusion through narrow pore apertures. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange increases the pore aperture size, allowing MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F to adsorb a large quantity of C2H2 and exhibit reversed selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Although many porous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have been reported to selectively adsorb C2H2 in C2H2/CO2 separation processes, CO2&#8208;selective sorbents are much less common. Here, we report the remarkable performance of MFU&#8208;4 (Zn5Cl4(bbta)3, bbta=benzo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;bistriazolate) toward inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The MOF facilitates kinetic separation of CO2 from C2H2, enabling the generation of high purity C2H2 (&gt;98&#8201;%) with good productivity in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Adsorption kinetics measurements and computational studies show C2H2 is excluded from MFU&#8208;4 by narrow pore windows formed by Zn&#8722;Cl groups. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange was used to synthesize an analogue (MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F) with expanded pore apertures, resulting in equilibrium C2H2/CO2 separation with reversed selectivity compared to MFU&#8208;4. MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F also exhibits a remarkably high C2H2 adsorption capacity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), allowing fuel grade C2H2 (98&#8201;% purity) to be harvested from C2H2/CO2 mixtures by room temperature desorption.

         <title>Heterobimetallic NiFe Cooperative Molecular Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of structurally well&#8208;defined bimetallic complexes (FeFe, NiFe, NiNi, ZnFe, NiZn) was used as a molecular platform to understand Ni/Fe cooperative water oxidation mechanism. The results disclosed that O&#8722;O bond formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety in NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O species, which provides a helpful guidance for rational design of heterobimetallic catalysts.







Abstract
We reported herein the development of heterobimetallic NiFe molecular platform to understand NiFe synergistic effect in water oxidation catalysis. Compared to homonuclear bimetallic compounds (NiNi and FeFe), NiFe complex possesses more remarkable catalytic water oxidation performance. Mechanistic studies suggest that this remarkable difference is attributed to the fact that NiFe synergy can effectively promote O&#8722;O bond formation. The generated NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O is the key intermediate and O&#8722;O bond was formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety.

         <title>Closing the Cycle as It Begins: Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Iodobiaryls via Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the Catellani reactions has enabled the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls starting from aryl iodides and bromides. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation (32 examples and 6 subsequent derivatizations), a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halide complexes.







Abstract
Despite the advances in the field of carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A new strategy based on the &lt;i&gt;Catellani reactions&lt;/i&gt; has enabled the one-pot synthesis of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-iodobiaryls starting from aryl iodides and bromides. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation (32 examples and 6 subsequent derivatizations), a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)-halide complexes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the advances in the field of carbon-halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis. This new example of Catellani reaction features the initial cleavage of a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;I bond, followed by the key formation of a palladacycle through &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H activation, the oxidative addition of an aryl bromide and the ultimate restoration of the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;I bond. A large variety of valuable &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-iodobiaryls has been synthesized in satisfactory to good yields and their derivatization have been described too. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation, a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the key reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)-halides complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new molecular design strategy has been proposed to construct the deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF molecules by the integration of asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N and symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units to form a rigid and extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton. The resultant ODBN exhibited deep&#8208;blue emission, high PLQY of 93&#8201;% and small FWHM of 26&#8197;nm. High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLED employing ODBN as emitter was achieved with maximum EQE value of 24.15&#8201;% and the CIE y coordinate below 0.1.







Abstract
Developing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we proposed a design strategy by integrating asymmetric oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (O&#8722;B&#8722;N) multi&#8208;resonance (MR) unit into traditional N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR molecules to form a rigid and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR &#960;&#8208;skeleton. Three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters of OBN, NBN and ODBN featuring asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N, symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units were synthesized through the regioselective one&#8208;shot electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation at different positions of the same precursor. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter ODBN exhibited respectable deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high photoluminescence quantum yield of 93&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26&#8197;nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing ODBN as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15&#8201;% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.

         <title>Chemoselective 1,2&#8208;Reduction and Regiodivergent Deuteration of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient protocol for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of arenes via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium has been reported for the first time. The versatility of this strategy further leads to a regiodivergent reductive deuteration that enables precise control of the deuteration sites as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, a general strategy for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of chromium&#8208;bound arenes was developed, thus providing rapid access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Selective arene activation via &#960;&#8208;complexation along with the use of mild hydride Ph3SiH can overcome the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds while tolerating various reduction&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Its versatility further enables a regiodivergent deuteration. Using different sequences of (non)deuterated hydride and acid reagents, the deuterated positions as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation can be controlled precisely, which leads to a large and previously inaccessible chemical space for 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene isotopologues. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on intermediate capture and control experiments. The synthetic value of this selective 1,2&#8208;reduction was demonstrated in the formal total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;galanthamine and (&#177;)&#8208;lycoramine.

         <title>Lithium Aluminium Hydride and Metallic Iron: A Powerful Team in Alkene and Arene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium aluminium hydride is well&#8208;known as a stoichiometric reducing agent for ketones. In combination with finely divided Fe0 it is a powerful catalyst for hydrogenation of challenging alkenes or even arenes. The actual catalyst is a thermal decomposition product of LiAlH4 and Fe0. The preactivated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst is also active under mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Alkenes that normally do not react with LiAlH4 (3&#8208;hexene, cyclohexene, 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene), can be reduced to the corresponding alkanes by a mixture of LiAlH4 and Fe0 (the iron was activated by Metal&#8208;Vapour&#8208;Synthesis). This alkene&#8208;to&#8208;alkane conversion with a stoichiometric quantity of LiAlH4/Fe0 does not need quenching with water or acids, implying that both H's originate from LiAlH4. The LiAlH4/Fe0 combination is also a remarkably potent cooperative catalyst for hydrogenation of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes and benzene or toluene. An induction period of circa two hours and the minimally required temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C, suggests that the actual catalyst is a combination of Fe0 and the decomposition product of LiAlH4 (LiH and Al0). A thermally pre&#8208;activated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst did not need an induction time and is also active at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar H2. A combination of AliBu3 and Fe0 is an even more active hydrogenation catalyst. Without pre&#8208;activation, tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes like Me2C=CMe2 and toluene could be fully hydrogenated.

         <title>Reversible Live&#8208;Cell Labeling with Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags Enables Long&#8208;Term High&#8208; and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags (reHaloTags) show substrate exchange in the seconds&#8208;to&#8208;minutes regime due to their restored dehalogenase activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, reHaloTags outperform the standard HaloTag7 in bleaching resistance and control of labeling density. Single molecule tracking and localization microscopy particularly benefits from these new tags, opening exciting possibilities for untangling protein dynamics over extended time.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (&#8776;0.006&#8197;s&#8722;1) and reHaloTagF (&#8776;0.055&#8197;s&#8722;1). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3&#8208;5&#8208;time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved.

     alt="Reversible Live-Cell Labeling with Retro-engineered HaloTags Enables Long-Term High- and Super-Resolution Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro-engineered HaloTags (reHaloTags) show substrate exchange in the seconds-to-minutes regime due to their restored dehalogenase activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, reHaloTags outperform the standard HaloTag7 in bleaching resistance and control of labeling density. Single molecule tracking and localization microscopy particularly benefits from these new tags, opening exciting possibilities for untangling protein dynamics over extended time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (&#8776;0.006&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and reHaloTagF (&#8776;0.055&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3-5-time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved. These applications highlight the potential of reHaloTag labeling for pushing the limits of advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Controllable Heterogeneous Supramolecular Polymerization of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers and Their Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy for the controllable heterogeneous supramolecular polymerization of liquid crystalline block copolymers. This strategy was demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust, and amphiphilic triblock copolymer&#8208;like supramolecular polymers were directly fabricated, which could spontaneously undergo high&#8208;level assembly to form hierarchical structures in a controllable manner.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly morphologies of subunits are largely governed by thermodynamics, which plays a less important role in dimensional control. Particularly for one&#8208;dimensional assemblies from block copolymers (BCPs), the negligible energy difference between short and long ones imposes great challenges in length control. Herein, we report that by incorporating additional polymers to induce in situ nucleation and trigger the subsequent growth, controllable supramolecular polymerization driven by mesogenic ordering effect could be realized from liquid crystalline BCPs. The length of the resultant fibrillar supramolecular polymers (SP) is controlled by tuning the ratio between nucleating and growing components. Depending on the choice of BCPs, the SPs can be homopolymer&#8208;like, heterogeneous triblock, and even pentablock copolymer&#8208;like. More interestingly, with insoluble BCP as a nucleating component, amphiphilic SPs are fabricated, which can undergo spontaneous hierarchical assembly.

         <title>N&#8208;(Morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide: A Shelf&#8208;Stable, Bilateral Platform Molecule Enabling Access to Diverse Unsymmetrical Disulfides

         <dc:description>
A shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare disulfurating reagent with chemoselectively displaceable amino and imide leaving groups is described. Protonation of this reagent promotes exclusive displacement of the amino group with various neutral carbon nucleophiles. The resulting dithiophthalimides are amenable to diverse substitution reactions under basic or neutral conditions, thus enabling expedient access to structurally diverse unsymmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
Synthetic methods for unsymmetrical disulfides are greatly needed owing to their applications in drug discovery, linker chemistry, and materials sciences. In this study, a new shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare bilateral disulfurating platform molecule, N&#8208;(morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical disulfides. The amino and imide leaving groups of this reagent can be orthogonally transformed. Under acidic conditions, the amino moiety undergoes selective protonation and thus can be displaced by various carbon nucleophiles, such as allyl trimethylsilanes, alkynyl silanes, and electron&#8208;rich arenes, leaving the phthalimide moiety untouched. Meanwhile, the phthalimide leaving group is amenable to substitution under basic or neutral conditions. The combination of these transformations provides rapid access to diverse unsymmetrical disulfides through two C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Turning the Inert Element Zinc into an Active Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Zn&#8722;N4 sites mediate transfer of electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to dissolved oxygen (DO). Self&#8208;oxidation of pollutants is realized along with PMS oxidation into singlet oxygen (1O2) and DO reduction into superoxide radicals (O2.&#8722;) for catalytic oxidation of contaminants. Resource consumption and residual sulfate anion (SO42&#8722;) formation are reduced.







Abstract
Amongst various Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the zinc (Zn)&#8208;related SACs have been barely reported due to the fully occupied 3d10 configuration of Zn2+ being inactive for the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Herein, the inert element Zn is turned into an active single&#8208;atom catalyst (SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC) for Fenton&#8208;like chemistry by forming an atomic Zn&#8722;N4 coordination structure. The SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC shows admirable Fenton&#8208;like activity in organic pollutant remediation, including self&#8208;oxidation and catalytic degradation by superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the single&#8208;atomic Zn&#8722;N4 site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration PMS toward dissolved oxygen (DO) to actuate DO reduction into O2&#8901;&#8722; and successive conversion into 1O2. This work inspires an exploration of efficient and stable Fenton&#8208;like SACs for sustainable and resource&#8208;saving environmental applications.

         <title>A Bioinspired Free&#8208;Standing 2D Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Polyimine Membrane for Selective Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of flexible dibenzo&#8208;14&#8208;crown&#8208;4&#8208;ether moieties into a rigid framework has led to the generation of a bioinspired ultrathin membrane that allows proton transport. The interconnected hydrogen&#8208;bond/water networks and ideal binding sites result in the highly selective and fast transportation of protons through the membrane.







Abstract
Biological proton channels play important roles in the delicate metabolism process, and have led to great interest in mimicking selective proton transport. Herein, we designed a bioinspired proton transport membrane by incorporating flexible 14&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (14C4) units into rigid frameworks of polyimine films by an interfacial Schiff base reaction. The Young's modulus of the membrane reaches about 8.2&#8197;GPa. The 14C4 units could grab water, thereby forming hydrogen bond&#8208;water networks and acting as jumping sites to lower the energy barrier of proton transport. The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi&#8208;planar molecular sheets. Furthermore, the 14C4 moieties could bond alkali ions through host&#8211;guest interactions. Thus, the ion conductance follows H+&#8811;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+, and an ultrahigh selectivity of H+/Li+ (ca. 215) is obtained. This study provides an effective avenue for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes by embedding macrocycle motifs with inherent cavities.

         <title>Practical and General Alcohol Deoxygenation Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for alcohol deoxygenation that functions across a wide range of alcohol structures is reported. This approach combines the reductive potency of carbon dioxide radical anion with acidic additives to promote the kinetically slow C(sp3)&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a practical protocol for the removal of alcohol functional groups through reductive cleavage of their benzoate ester analogs. This transformation requires a strong single electron transfer (SET) reductant and a means to accelerate slow fragmentation following substrate reduction. To accomplish this, we developed a photocatalytic system that generates a potent reductant from formate salts alongside Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids that promote fragmentation of the reduced intermediate. This deoxygenation procedure is effective across structurally and electronically diverse alcohols and enables a variety of difficult net transformations. This protocol requires no precautions to exclude air or moisture and remains efficient on multigram scale. Finally, the system can be adapted to a one&#8208;pot benzoylation&#8208;deoxygenation sequence to enable direct alcohol deletion. Mechanistic studies validate that the role of acidic additives is to promote the key C(sp3)&#8722;O bond fragmentation step.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Functional AIEgen for Spatiotemporal Pattern Control and All&#8208;round Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chromone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorogen called CPVCM can undergo a specific amination with primary amines and photoarrangement under UV irradiation. Its applications in developing multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors and an all&#8208;round information encryption system are based on its properties of multiple controls and responses.







Abstract
Functional materials with multi&#8208;responsive properties and good controllability are highly desired for developing bioinspired and intelligent multifunctional systems. Although some chromic molecules have been developed, it is still challenging to realize in situ multicolor fluorescence changes based on a single luminogen. Herein, we reported an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all&#8208;round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.

         <title>Outer&#8208;Shell Self&#8208;Supported Nickel Catalysts for the Synthesis of Polyolefin Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general heterogenization route was employed to prepare outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supported &#945;&#8208;diimine Ni catalysts. These heterogeneous catalysts demonstrate high activity, stable catalytic performances towards different fillers, and good morphology control in the synthesis of polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties.







Abstract
In situ heterogeneous olefin polymerization has attracted much attention for the synthesis of polyolefin composites. However, the complicated syntheses of specially designed catalysts or the detrimental effects of interactions between catalyst and solid supports pose great challenges. In this contribution, an outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supporting strategy was designed to heterogenize nickel catalysts on different fillers via precipitation homopolymerization of ionic cluster type polar monomer. These catalysts demonstrated high activity, good product morphology control, and stable performances in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization. Moreover, various polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties can be efficiently synthesized.

         <title>Regulating the Synergistic Effect in Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts by Adjusting the Coupling Strength Between Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, different metal center spacing or different conjugation degree of bridge skeleton were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers for OER.







Abstract
Bimetallic electrocatalysts with its superior performance has a broad application prospect in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect is still limited since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influence factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others. Herein, a series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) model OER catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers on OER performance. The coupling strength was regulated by adjusting the spacing between metal centers or the conjugation degree of bridge skeleton. Among the examined 2DPs, CoTAPP&#8208;Ni&#8208;MF&#8208;2DP, which has the strongest coupling strength between metal centers exhibited the best OER performance. These model systems can help to explore the precise structure&#8208;performance relationships, which is important for the rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels.

         <title>Spontaneous Chirality Induction in the Assembly of a Single Layer 2D Network with Switchable Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer chiral 2D network structures with photoswitchable internal cavities have been formed by the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene&#8208;based tetrapod aromatic amphiphiles, with spontaneous chirality induction arising from the breaking of both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The chiral network structures can selectively catch one enantiomer from a racemic solution and then release it upon UV irradiation through reversible pore deformation.







Abstract
Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral sheet structures are attractive because of their unique chemical and physical properties, single layer 2D chiral network structures with switchable pore interior remain elusive. Here we report spontaneous chirality induction in a single layer 2D network structure formed from the self&#8208;assembly of tetrapod azobenzene molecules. The chirality induction arises from multiple sublayers slipped in a preferred direction in which the sublayer consists of unidentical molecular arrangements in the in&#8208;plane a and b directions, breaking both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The protruded azobenzene units in the pore interior can be selectively isomerized upon UV irradiation, resulting in a reversible deformation of the chiral pores while maintaining the 2D frameworks. The chiral network can thus selectively entrap one enantiomer from a racemic solution with near perfect enantioselectivity, and then release it upon UV irradiation.

Rationally managing the secondary&#8208;phase excess lead iodide (PbI2) in hybrid perovskite is of significance for pursuing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the challenge remains on its conversion to a homogeneous layer that is robust stable against environmental stimuli. We herein demonstrate an effective strategy of surface reconstruction that converts the excess PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer, which substantially stabilizes the perovskite film and reduces interfacial charge transfer barrier in the PSCs device. The perovskite films with such bi&#8208;layer could bear harsh conditions such as soaking in water, light illumination at 70&#8201;% relative humidity, and the damp&#8208;thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% humidity) environment. The resulted PSCs deliver a champion efficiency up to 24.09&#8201;%, as well as remarkable environmental stability, e.g., retaining 78&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 5500&#8197;h of shelf storage, and 82&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h of operational stability testing.

         <title>Alkyne Insertion Enabled Vinyl to Acyl 1,5&#8208;Palladium Migration: Rapid Access to Substituted 5&#8208;Membered&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans and Indolines</title>

We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;palladium/hydrogen shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group, which provides a divergent access to substituted 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans and indolines. Further studies unveiled a novel relayed decarbonylative Catellani&#8208;type reaction. Mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations have shed light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8722;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4&#8208;palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5&#8208;palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5&#8208;palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a PdIV intermediate.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Titania Boosts Electroassisted Propane Dehydrogenation at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8722;In nanoalloy supported on Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 is a highly efficient catalyst for electroassisted propane dehydrogenation. Surface doping of Sm3+ enriched the surface proton density on TiO2 by charge compensation, which boosted propane dehydrogenation by accelerating proton collision on propane due to enhanced surface protonics. A propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was achieved at 300&#8201;&#176;C, which is far beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation.







Abstract
Electric field catalysis using surface proton conduction, in which proton hopping and collision on the reactant are promoted by external electricity, is a promising approach to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation in endothermic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study proposes a catalyst design concept for more efficient electroassisted PDH at low temperature. Sm was doped into the anatase TiO2 surface to increase surface proton density by charge compensation. Pt&#8722;In alloy was deposited on the Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 for more favorable proton collision and selective propylene formation. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH drastically increased by doping an appropriate amount of Sm (1&#8197;mol&#8201;% to Ti) where the highest propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was obtained at 300&#8201;&#176;C where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield was only 0.5&#8201;%. Results show that surface proton enrichment boosts alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Adsorbed Polymer&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zn and Non&#8208;Aqueous Li Batteries</title>

The optimized PEG adsorption interphases realize highly reversible Zn/Li anodes. The organic/inorganic SEI layer induced by the adsorbed PEG interphases plays a key role in the stability of the metal anode and the low N/P ratio full cells.







Abstract
Polymers are known to adsorb spontaneously from liquid solutions in contact with high&#8208;energy substrates to form configurationally complex, but robust phases that often exhibit higher durability than might be expected from the individual physical bonds formed with the substrate. Rational control of the physical, chemical, and transport properties of such interphases has emerged as a fundamental opportunity for scientific and technological advances in energy storage technology but requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the conformation states and electrochemical effect of the adsorbed polymers. Here, we analyze the interfacial adsorption of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains of moderate sizes dissolved in protic and aprotic liquid electrolytes and find that there is an optimum polymer molecular weight of approximately 400&#8197;Da at which the highest columbic efficiency is achieved for both Zn and Li deposition. These findings point to a simple, versatile approach for extending the lifetime of batteries.

         <title>Amplification of Dissymmetry for Circularly Polarized Photodetection by Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available point chirality units have been embedded adjacent to dicyanostilbene moieties in monomers to effect cooperative supramolecular polymerization. This effective and economic approach based on the synergistic participation of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, which facilitate remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core, allows photodetection based on circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Circularly polarized photodetectors require chiral light absorption materials with high sensing efficiency and low costs. Here readily accessible point chirality has been introduced to dicyanostilbenes as the chiral source, facilitating remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;aromatic core by cooperative supramolecular polymerization. The single&#8208;handed supramolecular polymers display powerful circularly polarized photodetection capability with a dissymmetry factor value as high as 0.83, superior to those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and oligomers. Strong chiral amplification occurs between the enantiopure sergeants and the achiral soldiers. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit comparable photodetection efficiency to those of the homopolymeric ones, with a 90&#8201;% decrease in the enantiopure compound consumption. Therefore, cooperative supramolecular polymerization provides an effective yet economical avenue toward circularly polarized photodetection applications.

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING potentiates immunotherapy agents. Using a luminescence&#8208;based cellular assay, we discovered a novel protein&#8208;protein interaction modulator, SB24011, that inhibited the STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction and upregulated cellular STING levels. As a result, SB24011 boosted STING immunity and improved the in vivo efficacy of immunotherapy with a STING agonist and an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody.







Abstract
Modulating target proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system has recently expanded the scope of pharmacological inventions. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an auspicious target for immunotherapy. Seminal studies envisioned the importance of STING as well as the utility of its agonists in immunotherapy outcomes. Herein, we suggest UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein&#8208;protein interaction strategy) to pharmacologically increase cellular STING levels for improved immunotherapy. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction, thus blocking TRIM29&#8208;induced degradation of STING. SB24011 enhanced STING immunity by upregulating STING protein levels, which robustly potentiated the immunotherapy efficacy of STING agonist and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody via systemic anticancer immunity. Overall, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING can be a promising approach for immuno&#8208;oncology.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Discovery of Potent Broad&#8208;Spectrum Vaccine Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Au nanoparticle (AuNP) adjuvants are prepared through computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning to discover agonist ligands, and sulfur&#8208;Au coordination chemistry guided well&#8208;ordered presentation of ligands on AuNP surface. These AuNP adjuvants show advantages in multi&#8208;toll like receptor (TLR) targeting and application as broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants to boost robust multifaceted anti&#8208;tumor vaccine responses.







Abstract
Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to vigorously respond to a vaccine. While current adjuvants such as aluminum salts and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions have been used for decades, they do not generate broad and long&#8208;lasting responses in many vaccines. Consequently, more potent adjuvants are needed. Here, using computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning, we discovered 2 new, broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants that can boost vaccine responses. Our library containing 46 toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR)&#8208;targeting agonist ligands were assembled on Au nanoparticles. Comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies showed both leads promoted dendritic cell activation via multiple TLRs and enhanced antigen presentation to T cells. When used together with tumor&#8208;specific antigens to immunize mice against B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and 4T1&#8208;PD1 breast cancer, both adjuvants unleashed strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases. Our results show computer&#8208;aided design and screening can rapidly uncover potent adjuvants for tackling waning immunity in current vaccines.

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8208;Aryl Glycosylation by Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroaryl Glycosyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones undergo desulfonylative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling with aryl&#8208;substituted nucleophiles or electrophiles through two complementary catalytic systems. The reactions offer access to a wide variety of C&#8208;aryl glycoside products with high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are increasingly gaining attention in carbohydrate chemistry because they enable glycosyl precursors, readily accessible as anomeric mixtures, to converge to a single diastereomeric product. However, controlling the stereochemical outcome through transition&#8208;metal catalysis remains challenging, and methods that leverage bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfone donors to facilitate glycosylation are rare. Herein, we show two complementary nonprecious metal catalytic systems, based on iron or nickel, which are capable of promoting efficient C&#8722;C coupling between heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones and aromatic nucleophiles or electrophiles through distinct mechanisms and modes of activation. Diverse C&#8208;aryl glycosides were secured with excellent selectivity, scope, and functional&#8208;group compatibility, and reliable access to both &#945; and &#946; isomers was possible for key sugar residues.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on Solvation Structure of Carbonate Electrolyte toward Durable Sodium Metal Battery at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte is designed by molecular engineering of solvated structure. By introducing the additive ethylene sulfate, the sodium ion diffusion barrier is lowered and strong solid electrolyte interphase is formed, inhibiting sodium dendrite growth. The as&#8208;fabricated cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;cycle performance at a low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Carbonate electrolytes have excellent chemical stability and high salt solubility, which are ideally practical choice for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium (Na) metal battery at room temperature. However, their application at ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C) is adversely affected by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by electrolyte decomposition and the difficulty of desolvation. Here, we designed a novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte by molecular engineering on solvation structure. The calculations and experimental results demonstrate that ethylene sulfate (ES) reduces the sodium ion desolvation energy and promotes the forming of more inorganic substances on the Na surface, which promote ion migration and inhibit dendrite growth. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the Na||Na symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle of 1500&#8197;hours, and the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) battery achieves 88.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Reversible Zn Metal Anodes Enabled by Trace Amounts of Underpotential Deposition Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
M is a metal with a higher reduction potential and work function than Zn. If Mn+ is used as an electrolyte additive, Mn+ will deposit preferentially and then render UPD of Zn uniformly on M. Moreover, the deposited M can dissolve back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping and thus does not increase the interfacial charge transfer resistance, enabling a highly reversible Zn anode. Ni2+, Cr2+, and Co2+ have been verified to function as Mn+.







Abstract
Routine electrolyte additives are not effective enough for uniform zinc (Zn) deposition, because they are hard to proactively guide atomic&#8208;level Zn deposition. Here, based on underpotential deposition (UPD), we propose an &#8220;escort effect&#8221; of electrolyte additives for uniform Zn deposition at the atomic level. With nickel ion (Ni2+) additives, we found that metallic Ni deposits preferentially and triggers the UPD of Zn on Ni. This facilitates firm nucleation and uniform growth of Zn while suppressing side reactions. Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr3+ and Co2+ additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic&#8208;level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.

Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic-level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Guided Nickel&#8208;Indium Heterogeneous Alloy Electrocatalysts for Promoting the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>

Lattice mismatch guides the selective alloying of tetragonal In to fcc Ni rather than hcp Ni. The heterogeneous alloy with 5&#8197;at% In catalyzes the electrochemical production of 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with 9.15&#8197;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency at 400&#8197;mV vs. RHE in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
The immiscibility of crystallographic facets in multi&#8208;metallic catalysts plays a key role in driving the green H2 production by water electrolysis. The lattice mismatch between tetragonal In and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Ni is 14.9&#8201;% but the mismatch with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) Ni is 49.8&#8201;%. Hence, in a series of Ni&#8722;In heterogeneous alloys, In is selectively incorporated in the fcc Ni. The 18&#8211;20&#8197;nm Ni particles have 36&#8197;wt&#8201;% fcc phase, which increases to 86&#8201;% after In incorporation. The charge transfer from In to Ni, stabilizes the Ni0 state and In develops a fractional positive charge that favors *OH adsorption. With only 5&#8197;at% In, 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 is evolved at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with mass activity of 57.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at&#8212;400&#8197;mV, 200&#8197;h stability at &#8722;0.18&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Pt&#8208;like activity at high current densities, due to the spontaneous water dissociation, lower activation energy barrier, optimal adsorption energy of OH&#8722; ions and the prevention of catalyst poisoning.

         <title>Origin of the Activity Trend in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethanol over VOx/CeO2
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using operando time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped activity trend in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol over VOx/CeO2 catalysts as a function of VOx surface coverage. Vanadium and cerium synergistically change their oxidation states during the catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity correlates with the concentration of reversible Ce4+/3+ species.







Abstract
Supported vanadia (VOx) is a versatile catalyst for various redox processes where ceria&#8208;supported VOx have shown to be particularly active in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols. In this work, we clarify the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped ethanol ODH activity trend for VOx/CeOx catalysts using operando quick V K&#8208; and Ce L3&#8208; edge XAS experiments performed under transient conditions. We quantitatively demonstrate that both vanadium and cerium are synergistically involved in alcohol ODH. The concentration of reversible Ce4+/Ce3+ species was identified as the main descriptor of the alcohol ODH activity. The activity drop in the volcano plot, observed at above ca. 3&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;2 surface loading (ca. 30&#8201;% of VOx monolayer coverage), is related to the formation of spectator V4+ and Ce3+ species, which were identified here for the first time. These results might prove to be helpful for the rational optimization of VOx/CeO2 catalysts and the refinement of the theoretical models.

We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides by Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (CuAAC), providing facile access to chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary azides and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with newly developed PYBOX ligands with a C4 sulfonyl group. The key role of the C4 sulfonyl in tuning the electronic and steric properties of the chiral catalysts to enhance enantiomer discrimination is rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Newly developed pyridine&#8208;bisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands, bearing a C4 sulfonyl group, enable effective kinetic resolution of racemic azides derived from privileged scaffolds such as indanone, cyclopentenone, and oxindole, and their asymmetric CuAAC to afford &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high to excellent ee values. DFT calculations and control experiments reveal that the C4 sulfonyl group decreases the Lewis basicity of the ligand and increases the electrophilicity of the copper center for better recognition of azides, and functions as a shielding group to make the chiral pocket of the catalyst more effective.

         <title>Optical and Electrochemical Probes for Monitoring Cytochrome&#8197;c in Subcellular Compartments During Apoptosis</title>

Photoresponsive Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c)&#8208;sensing probes consisting of fluorescent caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer frameworks or redox&#8208;active caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer&#8208;functionalized nanoelectrodes are introduced. Light&#8208;activated, spatially confined, optical or electrochemical detection of Cyt.&#8201;c, in cellular subdomains, at the single cell level is demonstrated. The analytical tools are applied to monitor intracellular Cyt.&#8201;c translocation upon cell apoptosis.







Abstract
Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c) is a key initiator of the caspases that activate cell apoptosis. The spatiotemporal evaluation of the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments and the detection of Cyt.&#8201;c delivery between cellular compartments upon apoptosis is important for probing cell viabilities. We introduce an optical probe and an electrochemical probe for the quantitative assessment of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments at the single cell level. The optical or electrochemical probes are functionalized with photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzylphosphate ester&#8208;caged Cyt.&#8201;c aptamer constituents. These are uncaged by light stimuli at single cell compartments, allowing the spatiotemporal detection of Cyt.&#8201;c through the formation of Cyt.&#8201;c/aptamer complexes at non&#8208;apoptotic or apoptotic conditions. The probes are applied to distinguish the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments of epithelial MCF&#8208;10A breast cells and malignant MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cells under apoptotic/non&#8208;apoptotic conditions.

The spatiotemporal evaluation of the contents of Cyt.&#8201;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; in cellular compartments and the detection of Cyt.&#8201;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; delivery between cellular compartments upon apoptosis is important for probing cell viabilities. We introduce an optical probe and an electrochemical probe for the quantitative assessment of Cyt.&#8201;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; in cellular compartments at the single cell level. The optical or electrochemical probes are functionalized with photoresponsive o-nitrobenzylphosphate ester-caged Cyt.&#8201;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; aptamer constituents. These are uncaged by light stimuli at single cell compartments, allowing the spatiotemporal detection of Cyt.&#8201;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; through the formation of Cyt.&#8201;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;/aptamer complexes at non-apoptotic or apoptotic conditions. The probes are applied to distinguish the contents of Cyt.&#8201;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; in cellular compartments of epithelial MCF-10A breast cells and malignant MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cells under apoptotic/non-apoptotic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymerization Strategies to Construct a 3D Polymer Passivation Network toward High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional polymer passivation network was constructed by combining the bulk in situ polymerization and surface pre&#8208;polymerization/secondary polymerization strategies. The all&#8208;rounded passivation structure increased carrier diffusion length, promoted energy level alignment and carrier injection. Corresponding devices achieve a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V with an efficiency over 24&#8201;%, and module also achieves an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
The spontaneously formed uncoordinated Pb2+ defects usually make the perovskite films demonstrate strong n&#8208;type with relatively lower carrier diffusion length and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss. In this work, we adopt different polymerization strategies to construct three&#8208;dimensional passivation frameworks in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the strong C&#8801;N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pb coordination bonding and the penetrating passivation structure, the defect state density is obviously reduced, accompanied by a significant increase in the carrier diffusion length. Additionally, the reduction of iodine vacancies also changed the Fermi level of the perovskite layer from strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type, which substantially promotes the energy level alignment and carrier injection efficiency. As a result, the optimized device achieved an efficiency exceeded 24&#8201;% (the certified efficiency is 24.16&#8201;%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V, and the corresponding module achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.

         <title>Exciton Localization for Highly Luminescent Two&#8208;Dimensional Tin&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites through Tin Vacancy Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and efficient Sn2+ vacancy tuning strategy is proposed to achieve strongly localized excitons in two&#8208;dimensional (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets by separating corner&#8208;sharing [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedra, thereby promoting their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported thus far for tin iodide perovskites.







Abstract
Exciton localization is an approach for preparing highly luminescent semiconductors. However, realizing strongly localized excitonic recombination in low&#8208;dimensional materials such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites remains challenging. Herein, we first propose a simple and efficient Sn2+ vacancy (VSn) tuning strategy to enhance excitonic localization in 2D (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets (PNSs), increasing their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for tin iodide perovskites. Combining experimental with first&#8208;principles calculation results, we confirm that the significantly increased PLQY of (OA)2SnI4 PNSs is primarily due to self&#8208;trapped excitons with highly localized energy states induced by VSn. Moreover, this universal strategy can be applied for improving other 2D Sn&#8208;based perovskites, thereby paving a new way to fabricate diverse 2D lead&#8208;free perovskites with desirable PL properties.

         <title>Development of a Versatile Protein Labeling Tool for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging Using Fluorescent &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile protein labeling system was developed using non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors. Fluorophore&#8208;diazabicyclooctane prodrug conjugates efficiently and stably labeled &#946;&#8208;lactamase tag&#8208;fused proteins localized in various intracellular compartments in living cells. Furthermore, use of a pH&#8208;activatable fluorophore allowed visualization of lysosomal protein trafficking at the late stage of autophagy under cellular starvation.







Abstract
To understand the function of protein in live cells, real&#8208;time monitoring of protein dynamics and sensing of their surrounding environment are important methods. Fluorescent labeling tools are thus needed that possess fast labeling kinetics, high efficiency, and long&#8208;term stability. We developed a versatile chemical protein&#8208;labeling tool based on fluorophore&#8208;conjugated diazabicyclooctane &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and wild&#8208;type TEM&#8208;1 &#946;&#8208;lactamase protein tag. The fluorescent probes efficiently formed a stable carbamoylated complex with &#946;&#8208;lactamase, and the labeled proteins were visualized over a long period of time in live cells. Moreover, use of an &#945;&#8208;fluorinated carboxylate ester&#8208;based BLI prodrug enabled the probe to permeate cell membranes and stably label intracellular proteins after unexpected spontaneous ester hydrolysis. Lastly, combining the labeling tool with a pH&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe allowed visual monitoring of lysosomal protein translocation during autophagy.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination of Iridium Single&#8208;atom IrN3O Boosting Formic Acid Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a rational catalyst design process by integrating theoretical prediction and experimental realization. Asymmetrically coordinated iridium single atoms IrN3O embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks are unambiguously revealed for the optimum formic acid electro&#8208;oxidation catalysis, which reaches a peak current of 20.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1, 167&#8197;times superior to that of the Ir/C nanocatalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single&#8208;atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single&#8208;atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4&#8722;xOx (x=1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near&#8208;zero overpotential. The as&#8208;designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen&#8208;rich glucose and nitrogen&#8208;rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Bandgap&#8208;tunable Transition Metal Sulfides through Gas&#8208;phase Cation Exchange&#8208;induced Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of cation exchange with different crystal structures is limited. We propose a new descriptor, the parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), to synthesize transition metal sulfides with crystal structure selectivity by gas&#8208;phase cation exchange&#8208;induced topological transformation. Powered by precise synthetic control, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is improved by 36.2 times after band gap engineering.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) with controlled compositions and crystal structures has long been promising for electronic devices and energy applications. Liquid&#8208;phase cation exchange (LCE) is a well&#8208;studied route by varying the compositions. However, achieving crystal structure selectivity is still a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate gas&#8208;phase cation exchange (GCE), which can induce a specific topological transformation (TT), for the synthesis of versatile TMSs with identified cubic or hexagonal crystal structures. The parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), a new descriptor, is defined to describe the substitution of cations and the transition of the anion sublattice. Under this principle, the band gap of targeted TMSs can be tailored. Using the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as an example, the optimal hydrogen evolution rate of a zinc&#8208;cadmium sulfide (ZCS4) is determined to be 11.59&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, showing a 36.2&#8208;fold improvement over CdS.

         <title>Insights into the Role of Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photobase in Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in (sp3)C&#8722;H Oxygenation of Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation of oxazolidinones to corresponding oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones is enabled by mpg&#8208;CN, a carbon nitride photocatalyst, using oxygen gas as an oxidant. The reaction proceeds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The mechanism of this transformation is established by photocatalytic experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) is a transition metal free semiconductor that mediates a variety of photocatalytic reactions. Although photoinduced electron transfer is often postulated in the mechanism, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a more favorable pathway for substrates possessing X&#8722;H bonds. Upon excitation of an (sp2)N&#8208;rich structure of g&#8208;CN with visible light, it behaves as a photobase&#8212;it undergoes reductive quenching accompanied by abstraction of a proton from a substrate. The results of modeling allowed us to identify active sites for PCET&#8212;the &#8216;triangular pockets&#8217; on the edge facets of g&#8208;CN. We employ excited state PCET from the substrate to g&#8208;CN to selectively cleavethe endo&#8208;(sp3)C&#8722;H bond in oxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;ones followed by trapping the radical with O2. This reaction affords 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones. Measurement of the apparent pKa value and modeling suggest that g&#8208;CN excited state can cleave X&#8722;H bonds that are characterized by bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) &#8776;100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Construction of Multiform Hollow&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Facile and Universal Strategy for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond was proposed for the fast synthesis of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs), achieving the construction of a HCOFs library with diverse nanostructures. The synthesized HCOFs with abundant cavities are ideal nanocarriers for high&#8208;efficiency drug loading, thus enhancing the sonodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The special structural morphology of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) has an important influence on their applications. However, the rapid and precise control of morphology for HCOFs still remains largely challenging. Herein, we present a facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond for the controllable synthesis of HCOFs. The strategy enables to prepare HCOFs in a greatly shortened reaction time and seven kinds of HCOFs are fabricated by the oxidation of imine bond via hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated from Fenton reaction. Importantly, a fascinating library of HCOFs with diverse nanostructures, including bowl&#8208;like, yolk&#8208;shell, capsule&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like morphologies, has been ingeniously constructed. Owing to the large cavities, the obtained HCOFs are ideal candidates for drug delivery, which are employed to load five small molecule drugs, achieving the enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy in vivo.

Abstract
Enantiopure [6]helicene containing an embedded seven&#8208;membered ring and carbo[7]helicene (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) with opposite helicity were simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99&#8201;%) synthesized with a perfect stereospecificity through stepwise acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne annulations of doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors. The helical handedness of the [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes was fully stereocontrolled by the doubly axial chirality of the precursors as a result of complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer. The cyclizations proceeded in a stepwise manner; the first six&#8208;membered ring formation was followed by the kinetically controlled seven&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring formation with or without helix&#8208;inversion of a [4]helicene intermediate generated during the first cyclization step, thus quantitatively producing enantiopure circularly polarized luminescent [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes with opposite helicity.

         <title>Unlocking a (Pseudo)&#8208;Mechanically Interlocked Molecule with a Coronene &#8220;Shoehorn&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) comprising a tetragold metallobox and a tetraoctynyl&#8208;pyrene guest that can be regarded as a pseudo&#8208;metallosuit[4]ane is described. In contrast to other MIMs, the tetrasubstituted guest can be released from this molecule by the addition of coronene through a &#8220;shoehorning&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have gained increasing interest during the last decades, not only because of their aesthetic appeal, but also because their unique properties have allowed them to find applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, chemosensing and biomedicine. Herein we describe how a pyrene molecule with four octynyl substituents can be easily encapsulated within the cavity of a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallobox, by template formation of the metallo&#8208;assembly in the presence of the guest. The resulting assembly behaves as a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM), in which the four long limbs of the guest protrude from the entrances of the metallobox, thus locking the guest inside the cavity of the metallobox. The new assembly resembles a metallo&#8208;suit[4]ane, given the number of protruding long limbs and the presence of the metal atoms in the host molecule. However, unlike normal MIMs, this molecule can release the tetra&#8208;substituted pyrene guest by the addition of coronene, which can smoothly replace the guest in the cavity of the metallobox. Combined experimental and computational studies allowed the role of the coronene molecule in facilitating the release of the tetrasubstituted pyrene guest to be explained, through a process that we named &#8220;shoehorning&#8221;, as the coronene compresses the flexible limbs of the guest so that it can reduce its size to slide in and out the metallobox.

     alt="Unlocking a (Pseudo)-Mechanically Interlocked Molecule with a Coronene &#8220;Shoehorn&#8221;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) comprising a tetragold metallobox and a tetraoctynyl-pyrene guest that can be regarded as a pseudo-metallosuit[4]ane is described. In contrast to other MIMs, the tetrasubstituted guest can be released from this molecule by the addition of coronene through a &#8220;shoehorning&#8221; mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have gained increasing interest during the last decades, not only because of their aesthetic appeal, but also because their unique properties have allowed them to find applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, chemosensing and biomedicine. Herein we describe how a pyrene molecule with four octynyl substituents can be easily encapsulated within the cavity of a tetragold(I) rectangle-like metallobox, by template formation of the metallo-assembly in the presence of the guest. The resulting assembly behaves as a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM), in which the four long limbs of the guest protrude from the entrances of the metallobox, thus locking the guest inside the cavity of the metallobox. The new assembly resembles a metallo-suit[4]ane, given the number of protruding long limbs and the presence of the metal atoms in the host molecule. However, unlike normal MIMs, this molecule can release the tetra-substituted pyrene guest by the addition of coronene, which can smoothly replace the guest in the cavity of the metallobox. Combined experimental and computational studies allowed the role of the coronene molecule in facilitating the release of the tetrasubstituted pyrene guest to be explained, through a process that we named &#8220;shoehorning&#8221;, as the coronene compresses the flexible limbs of the guest so that it can reduce its size to slide in and out the metallobox.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin Manipulation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Layer through Mechanical Exfoliation for Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of Fe3+ spin states from high spin (HS; s=5/2) in bulk crystals to mixed spin lattices (with s=5/2 and low spin (LS); s=1/2) is demonstrated in a two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layer catalyst by mechanical exfoliation. The resulting catalyst has enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction (CO2RR) over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Spin manipulation of transition&#8208;metal catalysts has great potential in mimicking enzyme electronic structures to improve activity and/or selectivity. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate room&#8208;temperature spin state of catalytic centers. Herein, we report a mechanical exfoliation strategy to in situ induce partial spin crossover from high&#8208;spin (s=5/2) to low&#8208;spin (s=1/2) of the ferric center. Due to spin transition of catalytic center, mixed&#8208;spin catalyst exhibits a high CO yield of 19.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with selectivity of 91.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of high&#8208;spin bulk counterpart (50&#8201;% selectivity). Density functional theory calculations reveal that low&#8208;spin 3d&#8208;orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in promoting CO2 adsorption and reducing activation barrier. Hence, the spin manipulation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Luminescence and Domino Phase Transition of Hybrid Copper Halides with Nonlinear Optical Switching Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive luminescent material has been developed that not only exhibits reversible photoluminescence conversion and nonlinear optical switching in response to thermal stimulus, but also displays peculiar crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition induced domino&#8208;type single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition and mechanical force induced phase transition under concomitant emission&#8208;color change.







Abstract
Although phase transition materials (PTMs) under external stimuli are of great research interest duo to their rich potential applications, it is still challenging to explore multi&#8208;responsive PTMs. Herein, two different phases of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid copper&#8208;based halides, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Gua3Cu2I5 (Gua+=CN3H6+), were synthesized by solvent evaporation method, which they crystalize in the noncentrosymmetric space group Fdd2 with zero&#8208;dimensional structure and centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halogen framework, respectively. Interestingly, it is firstly demonstrated that Gua3Cu2I5 simultaneously possesses reversible PL conversion and NLO switching properties in response to thermal stimulus. Strikingly, apart from heat, its structural phase transition can also be triggered by crystalline&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition (CPR) and mechanical force. These new findings may pave a path for future exploration of PTMs with multiple physical properties.

         <title>Red Emissive Double Aza[7]helicenes with Antiaromaticity / Aromaticity Switching via the Redox&#8208;Induced Radical Cation and Dication Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridazine core structure with antiaromatic character has been utilized to synthesize a double aza[7]helicene with rarely accessible chiroptical properties in the red region as well as redox&#8208;active behaviour. This chiral polyaromatic hydrocarbon system shows oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent aromaticity/antiaromaticity switching via oxidation&#8208;induced cation species.







Abstract
We herein present the synthetic approach to a new antiaromatic double aza[7]helicene C that features NN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This heteroatom&#8208;doped helicene showed a rarely obtained long&#8208;wavelength emission and far&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state. These optical and chiroptical properties could be ascribed to both the NN&#8208;PAH core structure and the further extension through angular ring fusions. Such a unique electronic structure also culminated in facile chemical oxidations of neutral C to the positively charged chiral radical (C&#8901;+) and dication species (C2+). Interestingly, DFT computations revealed that the pyridazine central core showed an antiaromaticity&#8208;to&#8208;aromaticity switching, in contrast to the inversed transition for the helical periphery in cationic states. The reported approaches are anticipated to lead to the development of further redox&#8208;active chiral systems for potential applications in chiroptoelectronics, spintronics as well as fluorescent bioimaging.

         <title>Multitargeted Platinum(IV) Anticancer Complexes Bearing Pyridinyl Ligands as Axial Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel pyridinyl PtIV complexes obtained by ligand exchange reactions could quickly be reduced to the PtII parent drugs. The axial pyridines acted as leaving group ligands and were utilized for designing multitargeted anticancer prodrugs. These multitargeted pyridinyl PtIV complexes were effective in killing Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth.







Abstract
Although multitargeted PtIV anticancer prodrugs have shown significant activities in reducing drug resistance, the types of bioactive ligands and drugs that can be conjugated to the Pt center remain limited to O&#8208;donors. Herein, we report the synthesis of PtIV complexes bearing axial pyridines via ligand exchange reactions. Unexpectedly, the axial pyridines are quickly released after reduction, indicating their potential to be utilized as axial leaving groups. We further expand our synthetic approach to obtaining two multitargeted PtIV prodrugs containing bioactive pyridinyl ligands: a PARP inhibitor and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; these conjugates exhibit great potential for overcoming drug resistance, and the latter conjugate inhibits the growth of Pt&#8208;resistant tumor in vivo. This research adds to the array of synthetic methods for accessing PtIV prodrugs and significantly increases the types of bioactive axial ligands that can be conjugated to a PtIV center.

         <title>Methane Photooxidation with Nearly 100&#8201;% Selectivity Towards Oxygenates: Proton Rebound Ensures the Regeneration of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane dehydrogenation over boron nitride nanosheets proceeds via N&#8722;H surface bonds, which function as a hydrogen bonding trap to impede cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds and hinder continuous dehydrogenation. Electrons from the BN surface are injected into the antibonding orbitals of N&#8722;H bonds; thereby, the overoxidation of products into thermodynamically favored CO2 is significantly suppressed.







Abstract
Restrained by uncontrollable dehydrogenation process, the target products of methane direct conversion would suffer from an inevitable overoxidation, which is deemed as one of the most challenging issues in catalysis. Herein, based on the concept of a hydrogen bonding trap, we proposed a novel concept to modulate the methane conversion pathway to hinder the overoxidation of target products. Taking boron nitride as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept model, for the first time it is found that the designed N&#8722;H bonds can work as a hydrogen bonding trap to attract electrons. Benefitting from this property, the N&#8722;H bonds on the BN surface rather than C&#8722;H bonds in formaldehyde prefer to cleave, greatly suppressing the continuous dehydrogenation process. More importantly, formaldehyde will combine with the released protons, which leads to a proton rebound process to regenerate methanol. As a result, BN shows a high methane conversion rate (8.5&#8201;%) and nearly 100&#8201;% product selectivity to oxygenates under atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Tailoring the Asymmetric Structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;promoted Selective and Efficient Gold Extraction and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the MOF structure, the electronic structure of the amino group was optimized to act as a double donor of electrons and protons in the process of gold reduction and desorption, thus realizing the selective adsorption, rapid reduction and efficient recovery of gold ions in electronic waste.







Abstract
Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material (NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 for gold ions is up to 98.8&#8201;% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high&#8208;purity gold particles from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations indicate that &#8208;NH2 functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.

         <title>Engineering Flexible Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks with Guest Responsiveness via Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands with multiple coordination sites and solute guests results in flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks featuring guest&#8208;responsive behavior. This leads to a significant transformation in their coordination networks and hence properties, for example, controllable cargo release, and expands the rational design of flexible metal&#8208;organic materials.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8208;organic materials are of growing interest owing to their ability to undergo reversible structural transformations under external stimuli. Here, we report flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to diverse solute guests. The competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands of multiple coordination sites and solute guests (e.g., glucose) primarily determines the responsive behavior of the MPNs, as revealed experimentally and computationally. Glucose molecules can be embedded into the dynamic MPNs upon mixing, leading to the reconfiguration of the metal&#8208;organic networks and thus changes in their physicochemical properties for targeting applications. This study expands the library of stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible metal&#8208;organic materials and the understanding of intermolecular interactions between metal&#8208;organic materials and solute guests, which is essential for the rational design of responsive materials for various applications.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Nitrooxylation: Noncyclic Hypervalent Iodine Nitrooxylating Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagent is prepared from aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. This reagent facilitates the zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers with broad scope, and also can be used in the nitrooxylation of various enolizable C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Organic nitrates are broadly applied as pharmaceuticals (acting as efficient nitric oxide donor), energetic materials, building blocks in organic synthesis, etc. However, practical and direct methods to access organic nitrates efficiently are still rare, mainly due to the lack of powerful nitrooxylating reagents. Herein, we report bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagents, oxybis(aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanediyl) dinitrates (OAIDNs, 2), which are prepared just by using aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. The reagents are used to achieve a mild and operationally simple protocol to access diverse organic nitrates. By employing of 2, zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers is realized efficiently to access the corresponding &#946;&#8208;nitrooxy ketones with high functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, a series of direct and catalyst&#8208;free nitrooxylations of enolizable C&#8722;H bonds are carried out smoothly to afford the desired organic nitrates within minutes by just mixing the substrates with 2 in dichloromethane.

This work presents a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new AIEgen&#8208;based free&#8208;standing POP films at room temperature.

Abstract
We developed a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based free&#8208;standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N2 uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16&#8197;nm to &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen&#8208;based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8&#8201;% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen&#8208;based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a large red&#8208;shift (&#916;&#955;=141&#8197;nm), highly efficient energy&#8208;transfer ability (&#934;ET=91&#8201;%), and high antenna effect (11.3).

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a catalyst-free, atom-economical interfacial amino-yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new AIEgen-based free-standing POP films at room temperature. These POP films show bright luminescence with high PLQY up to 37.8&#8201;% and can encapsulate organic dyes to form efficient artificial light-harvesting thin films.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a catalyst-free, atom-economical interfacial amino-yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)-based free-standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16&#8197;nm to &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen-based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8&#8201;% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen-based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light-harvesting system with a large red-shift (&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;=141&#8197;nm), highly efficient energy-transfer ability (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;=91&#8201;%), and high antenna effect (11.3).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Desulfurization Method Reminiscent of Aquatic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be efficiently achieved under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer by micromolar concentrations of iron. The desulfurization mechanism likely involves iron(III) species produced through the oxidation of iron(II)&#8208;carbonate complexes by molecular oxygen and is reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters.







Abstract
One pillar of protein chemical synthesis based on the application of ligation chemistries to cysteine is the group of reactions enabling the selective desulfurization of cysteine residues into alanines. Modern desulfurization reactions use a phosphine as a sink for sulfur under activation conditions involving the generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. Here we show that cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be effected efficiently by micromolar concentrations of iron under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer, that is using conditions that are reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters. Therefore, our work shows that chemical processes taking place in aquatic systems can be adapted to a chemical reactor for triggering a complex chemoselective transformation at the protein level, while minimizing the resort to harmful chemicals.

         <title>A Quenched Size&#8208;Expanded Nucleotide Reports Activity of the Leukemia Biomarker Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT)
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogenic probe based on size&#8208;expanded adenosine is used to monitor activity of the leukemia biomarker and therapeutic target Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). The probe can measure TdT activity in cancer cell extract in real&#8208;time and report on its response to treatment. Use of the probe in a high&#8208;throughput screening led to the identification of the non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitor SCH202676.







Abstract
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) is a template&#8208;independent DNA polymerase that plays an essential role in the human adaptive immune system and is upregulated in several types of leukemia. It has therefore gained interest as a leukemia biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Herein, we describe a FRET&#8208;quenched fluorogenic probe based on a size&#8208;expanded deoxyadenosine that reports directly on TdT enzymatic activity. The probe enables real&#8208;time detection of primer extension and de novo synthesis activity of TdT and displays selectivity over other polymerase and phosphatase enzymes. Importantly, TdT activity and its response to treatment with a promiscuous polymerase inhibitor could be monitored in human T&#8208;lymphocyte cell extract and Jurkat cells using a simple fluorescence assay. Finally, employing the probe in a high&#8208;throughput assay resulted in the identification of a non&#8208;nucleoside TdT inhibitor.

         <title>Post&#8208;Nickelation of a Crystalline Trinuclear Copper Organic Framework for Synergistic Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic framework was fabricated by post&#8208;modification of the copper&#8208;containing organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu) with divalent nickel ions. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and nickel ions resulted in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO with a high conversion rate and selectivity.







Abstract
Rational regulation of electronic structures and functionalities of framework materials still remains challenging. Herein, reaction of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tribenzhydrazide with tris(&#956;2&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N,N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper (Cu3Py3) generates the crystalline copper organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu). Post&#8208;modification with divalent nickel ions affords the heterometallic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni). Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical simulations reveal their two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal structure geometry. A series of advanced spectroscopic techniques disclose the mixed CuI/CuII state nature of Cu3Py3 in USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with a uniform bistable Cu34+(CuI2CuII)&#8201;:&#8201;Cu35+(CuICuII2) (ca. 1&#8201;:&#8201;3) oxidation state, resulting in a significantly improved formation efficiency of the charge&#8208;separation state. This endows the Ni sites with enhanced activity and USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with outstanding photocatalytic CO2 to CO performance with a conversion rate of 22&#8201;130&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98&#8201;%.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Redox in Polyimide: Witness by In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;destructive in situ EPR technique is developed to directly observe the electronic signal conversion process of radical anions and dianions upon charge/discharge cycling, verifying the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reaction of polyimide electrodes in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Organic materials are promising candidates for future rechargeable batteries, owing to their high natural abundance and rapidly redox reaction. Elaborating the charge/discharge process of organic electrode is critical to unveil the fundamental redox mechanism of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but monitoring of this process is still challenging. Here, we report a nondestructive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to real&#8208;time detect the electron migration step within polyimide cathode. From in situ EPR tests, we vividly observe a classical redox reaction along with two&#8208;electron transfer which only shows one pair of peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve. The radical anion and dianion intermediates are detailed delineation at redox sites in EPR spectra, which can be further confirmed through density functional theory calculations. This approach is especially crucial to elaborate the correlation behind electrochemical and molecular structure for multistep organic&#8208;based LIBs.

Arene 1,2&#8208;reduction and regiodivergent deuteration via &#951;6&#8208;coordination have been developed by Wei Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218961). A diverse set of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene isotopologues were readily synthesized by precisely controlling the deuterated positions as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation.

         <title>Back Cover: Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 18/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein upregulation by modulating the interaction between a target protein and its E3 ligase is the strategy opposite to targeted protein degradation (PROTAC). In their Research Article (e202300978), Dong&#8208;Sup Lee, Seung&#8197;Bum Park enhanced the cellular STING levels by inhibiting STING&#8208;TRIM29 interaction, which activates innate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and potentiates the immune&#8208;oncology treatment by changing cold to hot tumors. Thus, targeted protein upregulation can be an alternative drug discovery strategy for undruggable targets.

Cell&#8208;selective regulation of protein translocation is achieved through the rational design of an endogenous enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids platform. The system enables enzyme&#8208;activated capture of proteins of interest and thus regulation of their cytoplasmic&#8208;nuclear shuttling with tumor&#8208;cell specificity, as reported by Mengyuan Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214958).

Reversible posttranslational fluorescence labeling opens exciting possibilities for advanced and superresolution microscopy techniques. In their Research Article (e202219050) Michael Holtmannsp&#246;tter, Jacob Piehler et&#8197;al. have engineered HaloTag variants with restored dehalogenase activity, which enzymatically exchange fluorogenic substrates at the second&#8208;to&#8208;minutes time scale. Thus, long&#8208;term time&#8208;lapse imaging with utmost spatial and temporal resolution is achieved with particularly striking performance in single molecule tracking and localization microscopy.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine is one of the most abundant motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, chemists were constrained in their ability to append substituents at the meta&#8208;position of pyridines. Two complementary one&#8208;pot approaches developed independently have helped to overcome this challenge. While one involves breaking the pyridine ring to form linear imines, the other relies on 1,4&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions to disrupt the aromaticity of pyridine.







Abstract
The pyridine core is among the most common motifs found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Consequently, the C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine is a prized reaction, as it can help access a broad spectrum of valuable chemicals. However, the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines hinder their meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring drastic conditions affecting functional group compatibility. A synthetic manoeuvre to overcome this challenge involves the temporary conversion of pyridines into electron&#8208;rich intermediates and subsequent regioselective electrophilic functionalization. This was recently accomplished by a ring&#8208;opening ring&#8208;closing sequence via Zincke imine intermediates by McNally and co&#8208;workers, and a dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization sequence via oxazino&#8208;pyridine intermediates by the Studer group. The mildness and simplicity of these protocols enable them to work with complex molecular setups for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules.

However, the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines hinder their &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring drastic conditions affecting functional group compatibility. A synthetic manoeuvre to overcome this challenge involves the temporary conversion of pyridines into electron-rich intermediates and subsequent regioselective electrophilic functionalization. This was recently accomplished by a ring-opening ring-closing sequence via Zincke imine intermediates by McNally and co-workers, and a dearomatization-rearomatization sequence via oxazino-pyridine intermediates by the Studer group. The mildness and simplicity of these protocols enable them to work with complex molecular setups for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Reconfigurable DNA frameworks provide a plethora of functional materials for constructing DNA nanostructures, operating switchable reactions, controlling optical phenomena, driving dynamic networks and designing materials with switchable properties.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology relies on the structural and functional information encoded in nucleic acids. Specifically, the sequence&#8208;guided reconfiguration of nucleic acids by auxiliary triggers provides a means to develop DNA switches, machines and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The present Review addresses recent advances in the construction and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures, networks and materials. Dynamic transformations proceeding within engineered origami frames or between origami tiles, and the triggered dynamic reconfiguration of scaled supramolecular origami structures are addressed. The use of origami frameworks to assemble dynamic chiroplasmonic optical devices and to operate switchable chemical processes are discussed. Also, the dynamic operation of DNA networks is addressed, and the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; stimuli&#8208;responsive all&#8208;DNA materials and their applications are introduced. Future perspectives and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures are presented.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cascades Combining Biocatalysis and Transition Metal Catalysis for Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging metal and enzyme catalysis provides multiple solutions for the synthesis of optically active molecules. To achieve this aim, both catalyst types need to work under similar reaction conditions avoiding mutual inactivation. Herein, successful one&#8208;pot sequential and concurrent cascades are described for the design of high&#8208;yielding transformations with excellent levels of (stereo)selectivity.







Abstract
The combination of catalytic methods provides multiple advantages in organic synthesis, allowing access to diverse organic molecules in a straightforward manner. Merging metal and enzyme catalysis is currently receiving great attention due to the possibility to assemble metal catalysis in C&#8722;C coupling, olefin metathesis, hydration and other reactions with the exquisite stereospecificity displayed by enzymes. Thus, this minireview is organized based on the action of the metal species (Pd, Ru, Au, Ir, Fe&#8230;) in combination with different enzymes. Special attention will be paid to the design of sequential processes and concurrent cascades, presenting solutions such as the use of surfactants or compartmentalization strategies for those cases where incompatibilities could hamper the overall process.

         <title>Integrating Computation, Experiment, and Machine Learning in the Design of Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Materials and Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides have many potential applications as building blocks in materials science and biomedicine since they organise into supramolecular structures. Advances in computational chemistry enable the mapping, searching and systematic evaluation of large sequence spaces to select viable candidates. Integration of computation and experiment provides understanding of specific interactions, enabling engineering of more versatile functional materials.







Abstract
Interest in peptide&#8208;based supramolecular materials has grown extensively since the 1980s and the application of computational methods has paralleled this. These methods contribute to the understanding of experimental observations based on interactions and inform the design of new supramolecular systems. They are also used to virtually screen and navigate these very large design spaces. Increasingly, the use of artificial intelligence is employed to screen far more candidates than traditional methods. Based on a brief history of computational and experimentally integrated investigations of peptide structures, we explore recent impactful examples of computationally driven investigation into peptide self&#8208;assembly, focusing on recent advances in methodology development. It is clear that the integration between experiment and computation to understand and design new systems is becoming near seamless in this growing field.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Emerging Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear optics (NLO) is a field of immense importance owing to its usefulness in lasing, bio&#8208;imaging, etc. In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a potential class of NLO materials. This Minireview presents an overview of the principles of NLO, a discussion on various aspects of designing COFs for NLO, and a summary of important real&#8208;life applications of COFs based on their NLO response.







Abstract
The vastness of organic synthetic strategies and knowledge of reticular chemistry have made covalent organic frameworks (COFs) one of the most chemically and structurally diverse class of materials with potential applications ranging from gas storage, molecular separation, and catalysis to energy storage and magnetism. Recently, this class of porous materials has garnered increasing interest as potential nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Traditionally, inorganic crystals, small&#8208;molecule organic chromophores, and oligomers have been studied for their NLO response. Nevertheless, COFs offer significant advantages over existing NLO materials in terms of higher mechanical strength, thermochemical stability, and extended conjugation. Herein, we discuss crucial aspects, terminology, and measurement techniques related to NLO, followed by a critical analysis of the design principles for COFs with NLO response. Furthermore, we touch on selected potential applications of these NLO materials. Finally, future prospects and challenges of COFs as NLO materials are discussed.

         <title>Hybrid Acid/alkali All Covalent Organic Frameworks Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery was developed by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. The hybrid battery displays excellent electrochemical performances with wide voltage window, high capacity and good cyclic stability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), thanks to their adjustable porous structure and abundant build&#8208;in functional motifs, have been recently regarded as promising electrode materials for a variety of batteries. There still remain grand opportunities to further utilizing their merits for developing advanced COFs&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. In such a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery, the cathodic COF favorably works in acid with a relatively positive potential, while the anodic COF preferably runs in alkali with a relatively negative potential. It thus can deliver a decently high discharge capacity of 92.97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8197;V, and exhibit high energy density of 74.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 along with a considerable cyclic stability over 300 cycles. The development of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept all&#8208;COFs battery may drive forward the improvement of newly cost&#8208;effective and performance&#8208;reliable energy storage devices.

         <title>A Catalytic Method for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Ketones, &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of versatile &#945;&#8208;quaternary acyclic ketones, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and aldehydes, by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles. Transformations employ simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a chiral phosphine, and generate a broad range of products bearing difficult to access dialkyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A practical method for the efficient and enantioselective preparation of versatile ketones and aldehydes that contain an &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter is described. Reactions utilize simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a monodentate chiral phosphine, and afford a variety of aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and alkyl&#8208;substituted ketone and aldehyde products in 25&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and 90&#8201;:&#8201;10 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio. Reactions proceed by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles, and display selectivity and conversion dependence on a protic additive. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through several product transformations.

         <title>Synthesis of Modified Poly(vinyl Alcohol)s and Their Degradation Using an Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradation of water&#8208;soluble PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade consisting of a lipase, an alcohol dehydrogenase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water&#8208;soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical&#8208;chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching in an FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of two FeIII complexes is reported. The change in spin state is reversible, recorded over several cycles with Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Appending a diethylamino group to the ligand of one of the complexes allows for a colorimetric response from blue&#8208;black to bright pink upon protonation.







Abstract
Reversible proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of an FeIII complex in solution is observed at room temperature. A reversible magnetic response was detected in the complex, [FeIII(sal2323)]ClO4 (1), using Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy which indicated cumulative switching from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin upon addition of one and two equivalents of acid. Infrared spectroscopy suggests a coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) effect, whereby protonation displaces the metal&#8208;phenoxo donors. The analogous complex, [FeIII(4&#8208;NEt2&#8208;sal2323)]ClO4 (2), with a diethylamino group on the ligand, was used to combine the magnetic change with a colorimetric response. Comparison of the protonation responses of 1 and 2 reveals that the magnetic switching is caused by perturbation of the immediate coordination sphere of the complex. These complexes constitute a new class of analyte sensor which operate by magneto&#8208;modulation, and in the case of 2, also yield a colorimetric response.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Chiral Resolution of Expanded Helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;Fused Benzene Rings
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings can be synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;coupling&#8208;mediated oligomerization followed by bismuth(III)&#8208;triflate&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their chiroptical properties were also studied.







Abstract
Expanded helicenes are expected to show enhanced chiroptical properties as compared to the classical helicenes but the synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of expanded helicenes Hn (n=1&#8211;4) containing 11, 19, 27 and 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings through Suzuki coupling&#8208;based oligomerization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Enantiopure H2, H3, and H4 can be isolated by chiral HPLC and they all exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) values (0.020 for H2, 0.021 for H3, and 0.021&#8211;0.024 for H4).

&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation to forge phosphonates with an &#945;-chiral carbon center through C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) couplings has been successful. However, the enantioselective C(sp)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling has not yet been disclosed. Reported herein is an unprecedented enantioconvergent cross-coupling of alkynyl bromides and &#945;-bromo phosphonates to deliver chiral &#945;-alkynyl phosphonates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Trifluoromethoxylation of Propargyl Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, great challenges still remain for direct asymmetric trifluoromethoxylation with only two successful reports since the first discovery. Here, by subtly tuning the leaving group, protecting group, ligand structure, reaction temperature, solvent and base, we finally realized a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates for the first time.







Abstract
Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity of trifluoromethoxy group (OCF3), methods for introducing OCF3 into organic molecules are in high demand. However, the research area of direct enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation is still in the embryonic stage, with limited enantioselectivity and/or reaction types. Here, we describe the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates using trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) as the trifluoromethoxy source in up to 96&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8208;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective synthesis of AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers has been rarely reported. Here, ethylene oxide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst owing to a Janus effects of Lewis acid on the activity of the two monomers.







Abstract
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of an Octagermacubane with Two Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanium(0) Atoms and its Unique Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis of an octagermacubane, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms, by the thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(silyl)germane and bis(silyl)germane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, is reported. Reduction of the octagermacubane with tBuMe2SiNa yields the first X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of a Ge&#8208;centered octagermacubane radical anion.







Abstract
Thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 9 and bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 17 at 100&#8201;&#176;C produces unexpectedly octagermacubane 18, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms (40&#8201;% yield). 18 was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and it is a singlet biradical (according to DFT quantum mechanical calculations and the absence of an EPR signal). Reactions of 18 with CH2Cl2 and H2O yield the novel dichloro&#8208;octagermacubane 24 and hydroxy&#8208;octagermacubane 25, respectively. Reduction of 18 with tBuMe2SiNa in THF produces an isolable octagermacubane radical anion 26&#8208;Na. Based on X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy and DFT quantum mechanical calculations, 26&#8208;Na is classified as a Ge&#8208;centered radical anion.

         <title>Isolation of Structurally Heterogeneous TCR&#8208;CD3 Extracellular Vesicle Subpopulations Using Caliper Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with different T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 oligomerization states has been verified by a proposed caliper strategy. Using a caliper probe with an optimized spacing of 16&#8197;nm, the strategy successfully isolated TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric EVs (mCD3 EVs) and TCR&#8208;CD3 dimeric EVs (dCD3 EVs) from the plasma of a skin transplantation mouse model. Phenotypic analysis confirmed dCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker for acute cellular rejection.







Abstract
Cells in different states can release diverse types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in intracellular communication or pathological processes. The identification and isolation of EV subpopulations are significant to explore their physiological functions and clinical value. In this study, structurally heterogeneous T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 EVs were proposed and verified for the first time using a caliper strategy. Two CD3&#8208;targeting aptamers were designed in the shape of a caliper with an optimized probe distance and were assembled on gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;Caliper) to distinguish TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric and dimeric EVs (m/dCD3 EVs) in skin&#8208;transplanted mouse plasma. Phenotyping and sequencing analysis revealed clear heterogeneity in the isolated m/dCD3 EVs, providing the potential for mCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and holding great prospects for distinguishing EV subpopulations based on protein oligomerization states.

         <title>Allosterically Regulated Guest Binding Determines Framework Symmetry for an FeII4L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic cages are an important class of synthetic hosts, which are able to mimic the structural adaptability and allosteric regulation of naturally occurring systems. A low&#8208;symmetry FeII4L4 tetrahedral cage reported here was able to adapt its geometry from S4 to C3 or T symmetry upon guest binding; multiple binding sites allowed the host to simultaneously bind distinct guests with negative allostery.

Self&#8208;assembly of a flexible tritopic aniline and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;formylpyridine subcomponents around iron(II) templates gave rise to a low&#8208;spin FeII4L4 capsule, whereas a high&#8208;spin FeII3L2 sandwich species formed when a sterically hindered 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;formylpyridine was used. The FeII4L4 cage adopted a new structure type with S4 symmetry, having two mer&#8208;&#916; and two mer&#8208;&#581; metal vertices, as confirmed by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The flexibility of the face&#8208;capping ligand endows the resulting FeII4L4 framework with conformational plasticity, enabling it to adapt structurally from S4 to T or C3 symmetry upon guest binding. The cage also displayed negative allosteric cooperativity in simultaneously binding different guests within its cavity and at the apertures between its faces.

         <title>Boradigermaallyl: (4+3) Cycloaddition&#8208;Initiated Boron Insertion into Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boradigermaallyl featuring a delocalized &#960;&#8208;bond shows a boron atom insertion into benzene at room temperature. The mechanism starts by a concerted (4+3) reaction between the germanium atoms of the digermaboraallyl and the 1,4&#8208;positions of a benzene molecule. Thus, boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene.







Abstract
The 2&#960; electron 1,3&#8208;dipole boradigermaallyl, valence&#8208;isoelectronic to an allyl cation, is synthesized from a bis(germylene). It reacts with benzene at room temperature by insertion of a boron atom into the benzene ring. Computational investigation of the mechanism shows the boradigermaallyl reacting with a benzene molecule in a concerted (4+3) or [&#960;4s+&#960;2s] cycloaddition reaction. Thus, the boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene as diene unit. This type of reactivity provides a novel platform for ligand assisted borylene insertion chemistry.

         <title>Covalent Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed alkyne trimerization followed by oxidating coupling and fusion of zinc porphyrin units was used to construct a porphyrin nanoring around a central covalent spoke. The size and shape of these nanorings (diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm) was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). A combination of zinc(II) and nickel(II) porphyrin units was used to increase the efficiency of the synthesis and control the positions of oxidative fusion.







Abstract
Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorophyll arrays and offer insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15&#8208;linked porphyrins. This porphyrin octadecamer was constructed using a covalent six&#8208;armed template, made by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of an H&#8208;shaped tolan with porphyrin trimer ends. The porphyrins around the circumference of the nanoring were linked together by intramolecular oxidative meso&#8208;meso coupling and partial &#946;&#8208;&#946; fusion, to give a nanoring consisting of six edge&#8208;fused zinc(II) porphyrin dimer units and six un&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrins. STM imaging on a gold surface confirms the size and shape of the spoked 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring (calculated diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm).

         <title>Targeting the Dark Lipid Kinase PIP4K2C with a Potent and Selective Binder and Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One obstacle to a better understanding of the &#8220;dark&#8221; lipid kinase PIP4K2C is the lack of chemical tool compounds for this protein. Here, we describe a picomolar PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, and an effective bivalent PIP4K2C degrader, TMX&#8208;4153, both of which display exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Thus, TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 represent two useful leads to further interrogate the therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol 5&#8208;phosphate 4&#8208;kinase, type II, gamma (PIP4K2C) remains a poorly understood lipid kinase with minimal enzymatic activity but potential scaffolding roles in immune modulation and autophagy&#8208;dependent catabolism. Achieving potent and selective agents for PIP4K2C while sparing other lipid and non&#8208;lipid kinases has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of the highly potent PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, which shows exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Furthermore, we elaborated the PIP4K2C binder into TMX&#8208;4153, a bivalent degrader capable of rapidly and selectively degrading endogenous PIP4K2C. Collectively, our work demonstrates that PIP4K2C is a tractable and degradable target, and that TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 are useful leads to further interrogate the biological roles and therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.

         <title>Digital Microfluidics and Magnetic Bead&#8208;based Intact Proteoform Elution for Quantitative Top&#8208;down Nanoproteomics of Single C.&#160;elegans Nematodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While most nanoproteomics approaches for the analysis of low&#8208;input samples are based on bottom&#8208;up proteomics workflows, top&#8208;down approaches enabling proteoform characterization are still underrepresented. Using mammalian cell proteomes, we established a facile one&#8208;pot sample preparation protocol based on protein aggregation on magnetic beads and intact proteoform elution using 40% formic acid. Performed on a digital microfluidics device, the workflow enabled sensitive analyses of single Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, thereby increasing the number of proteoform identifications compared to in&#8208;tube sample preparation by 46%. Label&#8208;free quantification of single nematodes grown under different conditions allowed to identify changes in abundance of proteoforms not distinguishable by bottom&#8208;up proteomics. The presented workflow will facilitate proteoform&#8208;directed analysis on samples of limited availability.</dc:description>

         <title>Fucose Binding Motifs on Mucin Core Glycopeptides Impact Bacterial Lectin Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucin glycoproteins are essential components of the mucosal barrier, which protects the host from pathogens. Throughout evolution, bacteria have developed strategies to modulate and penetrate this barrier, and cause virulence by interacting with mucin O&#8208;glycans at the epithelial cell&#8208;surface. O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes on mucins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. Here, a chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy is described to prepare a library of fucosylated mucin core glycopeptides to enable studies of mucin&#8208;interacting and fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins. Glycan cores with biologically important Lewis and H&#8208;antigens were prepared decorating the peptide backbone at different sites and densities. The fucosylated mucin glycopeptides were applied in microarray binding studies to explore the importance of glycan core and peptide backbone presentation of these antigens in binding interactions with the P.&#160;aeruginosa lectin LecB and the C.&#160;difficile toxin&#160;A.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization through Cationic Vacancy Defects in Bi4Ti3O12 for Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular oxygen (O2) activation technology is of great significance in environmental purification due to its eco&#8208;friendly operation and cost&#8208;effective nature. However, the activation of O2 is limited by spin&#8208;forbidden transitions, and efficient molecular oxygen activation depends on electronic behavior and surface adsorption. Herein, we prepared cationic defect&#8208;rich Bi4Ti3O12 (BTO&#8208;MV2) catalysts containing Ti vacancies (VTi) for O2 activation in water purification. The VTi on BTO nanosheets can induce electron spin polarization, increasing the number of spin&#8208;down photogenerated electrons and reducing the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs. An active surface VTi is also formed, serving as a center for adsorbing O2 and extracting electrons, effectively generating &#8226;OH, O2&#8226;&#8722; and 1O2. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by BTO&#8208;MV2 is 3.3 times faster than BTO, indicating a satisfactory prospect for practical application. This work provides an efficient pathway to activate molecular oxygen by constructing new active sites through cationic vacancy modification technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic nickel embedded in ceria with high specific CO2 methanation activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 hydrogenation to methane is gaining increasing interest as one of the most promising ways to store intermittent renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. Ni particles supported on CeO2 represents a highly efficient, stable and inexpensive catalyst for this reaction. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were tested for CO2 methanation showing an extremely high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando characterization reveals that this performance is tightly associated with ionic &#925;i and Ce3+ surface sites, while formation of metallic Ni does not seem to considerably promote the reaction. Theoretical calculations confirmed the stability of interstitial ionic Ni sites on ceria surfaces and highlighted the role of Ce&#8208;O frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), Ni&#8208;O classical Lewis pair (CLP) and Ni&#8208;Ce pair sites to the activation of H2 and CO2 molecules. To a large extent, the theoretical predictions were validated by in situ spectroscopy under H2 and CO2:H2 gaseous environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in pharmaceuticals because compounds with these motifs are more metabolically stable and more lipophilic than their nonfluorinated analogues. However, hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers have not been extensively studied, presumably because of the lack of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we describe a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitution of aryl chlorides or bromides, which act as the limiting reagents, with weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol under mild reaction conditions. This method provides diverse hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers. We demonstrated the generality of this method by carrying out reactions of a large array of unactivated aryl halides, and we found that the success of the reactions relied on arene activation by means of &#951;6&#8208;coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Tungstate&#8208;mediated In&#8208;situ Passivation of Grain Boundary Grooves in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Possessed with advantageous optoelectronic properties, perovskites have boosted the rapid development of solution&#8208;processed solar cells. The performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly weakened by the carrier loss at grain boundary grooves (GBGs); however, it receives limited attention and there lacks effective approach to solve this issue. Herein, for the first time, we constructed the tungstate/perovskite heterointerface via a &#8220;two step&#8221; in&#8208;situ reaction approach that provides effective defect passivation and ensures efficient carrier dynamics at the GBGs. The exposed perovskite at grain boundaries is converted to wide&#8208;band&#8208;gap PbWO4 via an in&#8208;situ reaction between Pb2+ and tungstate ions, which passivate defects due to the strong ionic bonding. Moreover, recombination loss is further suppressed via the heterointerface energetics modification based on an additional transformation from PbWO4 to CaWO4. PSCs based on this groove modification strategy showed good universality in both normal and inverted structure, with an improved efficiency of 23.25% in the n&#8208;i&#8208;p device and 23.33% in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device. Stable power output of the modified device could maintain 91.7% after ~1100 h, and the device efficiency could retain 92.5% after aging in air for ~ 2110 h, and 93.1% after aging at 85 &#176;C in N2 for 972 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Elaborating E/Z&#8208;Geometry of Alkenes via Cage&#8208;Confined Arylation Catalysis of Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light photosensitizing metal&#8208;organic cage is applied as an artificial supramolecular reactor to control the reaction of aryl radicals with terminal olefins under green light/solvent conditions, which facilitates selective transformation in the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment to give a series of geometrically defined E/Z&#8208;alkenes. The hydrophobic cage displays good host&#8208;guest inclusion with aromatic substrates, promoting Meerwein arylation and protecting E&#8208;isomeric products during reaction; while a small amount of benzonitrile can turn on efficient E&#8594;Z isomerization. Besides &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, the hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding interactions also act as control forces for the arylation of aliphatic terminal olefins known as poor acceptors in classic Meerwein arylation. The application of this switchable cage&#8208;confined arylation catalysis has been demonstrated by the syntheses of Tapinarof and a marine natural product from the same substrate via controllable E/Z selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Polysulfides through Photocatalyzed Dithiosulfonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we outline a general method for photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, diene, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane using dithiosulfonate reagents (ArSO2&#8722;SSR) with improved atom economy. Both &#8220;ArSO2&#8722;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;SSR&#8221; on the dithiosulfonate are transferred under mild conditions with broad substrate scope, high stereoselectivity, and complete regioselectivity. Significantly, the resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is a general and practical nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, reacting with a variety of electrophiles efficiently. Both reactions can be conducted in gram scale, rendering the approach highly valuable.</dc:description>

         <title>Minimizing Temperature Bias through Reliable Temperature Determination in Gas&#8208;Solid Photothermal Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enormous advances in photothermal catalysis have been made over the years, whereas the temperature assessment still remains controversial in the majority of photothermal catalytic systems. Herein, we methodically uncovered the phenomenon of temperature determination bias arising from prominent temperature differences in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic systems, which extensively existed yet has been overlooked in most relevant cases. To avoid the interference of temperature bias, we developed a universal protocol for reliable temperature evaluation of gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions, with emphasis on eliminating the temperature gradient and temperature fluctuation of catalyst layer via optimizing the reaction system. This work presents a functional and credible practice for temperature detection, calling attention to addressing the effects of temperature differences, and reassessing the actual temperature&#8208;based performances in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of the &#946;&#8208;Bulge Gate in a Green Fluorescent Protein Accelerates the Kinetics of Sulfate Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of anions in complex aqueous media is a fundamental challenge with practical utility that can be addressed by supramolecular chemistry. Biomolecular hosts such as proteins can be used and adapted as an alternative to synthetic hosts. Here, we report how the mutagenesis of the &#946;&#8208;bulge residues (D137 and W138) in mNeonGreen, a bright, monomeric fluorescent protein, unlocks and tunes the anion preference at physiological pH for sulfate, resulting in the turn&#8208;off sensor SulfOFF&#8208;1. This unprecedented sensing arises from an enhancement in the kinetics of binding, largely driven by position 138. In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the &#946;&#8208;barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <title>A General and Practical Route to Functionalized BCP&#8208;Heteroaryls Enabled by Photocatalytic Multicomponent Heteroarylation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract BCP aryls are an important class of BCP derivatives, with widespread application in drug development. In particular, most of their synthesis requires multiple chemical steps via BCP electrophile or nucleophile from [1.1.1]propellane. While one&#8208;step, multicomponent catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions could provide a more sustainable route to rapidly access diverse BCP&#8208;aryls, the current approaches are limited to tertiary radicals, leading to a decrease in their practical value. In this study, we describe a conceptually different approach enabled by desulfonative multicomponent radical reaction involving [1.1.1]propellane to access functionalized BCP&#8208;heteroaryl products. Importantly, this protocol can be compatible with primary, secondary, tertiary, and various fluoroalkyl radical sources, thus enabling modular synthesis of BCP&#8208;heteroaryl.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective P&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) is an attractive method for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds,&#160;but the development of such a dynamic kinetic asymmetric process remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic intermolecular P&#8208;C coupling of SPOs and aryl iodides catalyzed by copper complexes ligated by a finely modified chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. The reaction tolerates a wide range of SPOs and aryl iodides, affording P&#8208;stereogenic tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) in high yields and with good enantioselectivity (average 89.2% ee). The resulting enantioenriched TPOs were transformed into structurally diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are highly valuable as ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

The resulting enantioenriched TPOs were transformed into structurally diverse P-chiral scaffolds, which are highly valuable as ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Performance&#8208;advantaged Stereoregular Recyclable Plastics Enabled by Aluminum&#8208;catalytic Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Dithiolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically recyclable polymers that can depolymerize into their constituent monomers are attractive candidates to replace non&#8208;recyclable petroleum&#8208;derived plastics. However, the physical properties and mechanical strengths of depolymerizable polymers are commonly insufficient for practical applications. Here we demonstrate that by proper ligand design and modification, aluminum complexes can catalyse stereoretentive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of dithiolactone, yielding highly isotactic polythioesters with molar masses up to 45.5 kDa. This material can form crystalline stereocomplex with a Tm of 94.5 &#176;C, and exhibits mechanical performances comparable to petroleum&#8208;based low density polyethylene. Exposure of the polythioester to aluminum precatalyst used to synthesized it resulted in depolymerization to pristine chiral dithiolactone. Experimental and computational studies suggest that aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, thereby avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions, which has not been accessible using other metal catalysts. Overall, aluminum catalysis provides access to performance&#8208;advantaged stereoregular recyclable plastics as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, thus incentivizing improved plastic sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Spinel ZnCo2O4 through Filling Oxygen Vacancies with Fluorine for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we successfully filled the lattice oxygen vacancies of ZnCo2O4 with F atom, achieving the activation of lattice oxygen by regulating metal&#8208;oxygen hybridization, and the dominant oxygen evolution reaction mechanism on ZnCo2O4 can transform from adsorbate evolution mechanism to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism.







Abstract
The development of productive catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge requiring significant progress in both mechanism and material design. Conventionally, the thermodynamic barrier of lattice oxidation mechanism (LOM) is lower than that of absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) because the former can overcome certain limitations. However, controlling the OER pathway from the AEM to the LOM by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the catalyst remains challenging. Herein, we incorporated F anions into the oxygen vacancies of spinel ZnCo2O4 and established a link between the electronic structure and the OER catalytic mechanism. Theoretical density calculations revealed that F upshifts the O 2p center and activates the redox capability of lattice O, successfully triggering the LOM pathway. Moreover, the high electronegativity of F anions is favourable for balancing the residual protonation, which can stabilize the structure of the catalyst.

         <title>Atroposelective Three&#8208;Component Coupling of Cyclic Diaryliodoniums and Sodium Cyanate Enabled by the Dual&#8208;Role of Phenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atroposelective copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium, cyanate and phenols is used to synthesize axially chiral carbamates. The success of this coupling is attributed to the key dual role of phenols, which are capable of activating the copper catalyst and trapping the isocyanate intermediate.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums, sodium cyanate (NaOCN) and phenols is reported. The reaction chemoselectively affords axially chiral carbamates by sequential coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium and NaOCN, followed by phenol. Mechanistic investigations revealed that phenol is not only a reagent to trap highly active intermediate isocyanates, but it also activates the copper catalyst as a standby ligand. The carbamates were readily transformed into highly functionalized urea derivatives within a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Supramolecular Polymers Based on Selectively Recognized Aromatic Cation&#8208;&#960; and Donor&#8208;Acceptor Motifs for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first demonstration of an aromatics&#8208;selective recognition strategy for cation&#8208;&#960; and donor&#8208;acceptor motifs that avoid their mutual interference, thus enabling the construction of two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers (2DSPs), which exhibit boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic polymers have recently received considerable interest, especially those whose architectures are held together via supramolecular engineering. However, current approaches toward supramolecular 2D structures usually suffer from mutual interference of noncovalent interactions and lack of intrinsic functions. Herein, we report well&#8208;regulated 2D supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) through an aromatics&#8208;selective recognition strategy of cation&#8208;&#960; and donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) motifs, which are derived from C4&#8208;symmetric cationic monomers and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecules. By subtly designing the strength and direction of noncovalent driving forces, the mutual interference between cation&#8208;&#960; and D&#8208;A interactions is effectively avoided, enabling the construction of 2DSPs in aqueous solution. On this basis, the resultant 2DSPs possess boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity at a rate of 600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is mainly ascribed to the specific stacking mode of cation&#8208;&#960;/D&#8208;A motifs and the ordered 2D structures.

         <title>Practical Access to meta&#8208;Substituted Anilines by Amination of Quinone Imine Ketals Derived from Anisidines: Efficient Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Psychotic Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;amination of arylamines with aliphatic&#8208;, heterocyclic&#8208; and aromatic amines is reported based on a one&#8208;pot procedure. The strategy is based on direct C&#8722;N bond formation for the practical synthesis of meta&#8208;substituted anilines, thus reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity. A concise and efficient synthesis of anti&#8208;psychotics and in particular of anti&#8208;schizophrenic drugs is shown.







Abstract
Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C&#8722;H activation provides efficient retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds. Described herein is the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction that selectively performs meta&#8208;amination of anisidines with aliphatic&#8208;, heterocyclic&#8208; and aromatic amines in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In addition to dramatically simplifying the synthesis of meta&#8208;substituted anilines, our approach has the advantage of the scalability and remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds and natural products. The control experiments and detailed computational analysis provide insight into the reaction mechanism and the origin of meta&#8208;selectivity. The protocol extended to the synthesis of challenging tri&#8208;aminated arenes and successfully applied for the efficient synthesis of 5&#8208;HT6 receptor antagonists, the anti&#8208;psychotic drugs viz.. SB&#8208;214111, SB&#8208;258510, and specifically, anti&#8208;schizophrenic drug SB&#8208;271046.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;N Atropisomers by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N indole&#8208;pyrrole and bisindole atropisomers was achieved by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed TDG&#8208;enabled C&#8722;H functionalization. A wide variety of the N&#8722;N atropisomers were produced in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities by C&#8722;H alkenylation, alkynylation, allylation or arylation reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric construction of N&#8722;N atropisomeric biaryls remains a formidable challenge. Studies of them lag far behind studies of the more classical carbon&#8208;carbon biaryl atropisomers, hampering meaningful development. Herein, the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation of pyrroles for the synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were produced with good yields and high enantioselectivities by alkenylation, alkynylation, allylation, or arylation reactions. Furthermore, the kinetic resolution of trisubstituted N&#8722;N heterobiaryls with more sterically demanding substituents was also achieved. Importantly, this versatile C&#8722;H functionalization strategy enables iterative functionalization of pyrroles with exquisite selectivity, expediting the formation of valuable, complex, N&#8722;N atropisomers.

         <title>Synthesis of Cationic Biphen[4, 5]arenes as Biofilm Disruptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic biphen[n]arenes were designed and synthesized, which could inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate stubborn mature biofilms. Moreover, their effective complexation with the conventional antibiotic cefazolin sodium could further enhance the biofilm disruption efficacy in vitro and synergistically improve the healing effect in E.&#8197;coli&#8208;infected mice.







Abstract
Since bacteria in biofilms are inherently resistant to antibiotics and biofilm&#8208;associated infections pose a serious threat to global public health, new therapeutic agents and schemes are urgently needed to meet clinical requirements. Here two quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized biphen[n]arenes (WBPn, n=4, 5) were designed and synthesized with excellent anti&#8208;biofilm potency. Not only could they inhibit the assembly of biofilms, but also eradicate intractable mature biofilms formed by Gram&#8208;positive S.&#8197;aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E.&#8197;coli bacterial strains. Moreover, they could strongly complex a conventional antibiotic, cefazolin sodium (CFZ) with complex stability constants of (7.41&#177;0.29)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 for CFZ/WBP4 and (4.98&#177;0.49)&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 for CFZ/WBP5. Combination of CFZ by WBP4 and WBP5 synergistically enhanced biofilm eradication performance in vitro and statistically improved healing efficacy on E.&#8197;coli&#8208;infected mice models, providing a novel supramolecular strategy for combating biofilm&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>Manipulating Local Lattice Distortion for Spectrally Stable and Efficient Mixed&#8208;halide Blue Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new local lattice distortion (LLD) manipulation strategy was demonstrated to suppress the halide migration in mixed&#8208;halide perovskite. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that the LLD manipulation effectively suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLED with champion EQE of 14.2&#8201;% at 475&#8197;nm and impressive T50 of 72&#8197;min has been achieved, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs reported yet.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites are considered the most straightforward candidate to realize blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, they suffer severe halide migration, leading to spectral instability, which is particularly exaggerated in high chloride alloying perovskites. Here, we demonstrate energy barrier of halide migration can be tuned by manipulating the degree of local lattice distortion (LLD). Enlarging the LLD degree to a suitable level can increase the halide migration energy barrier. We herein report an &#8220;A&#8208;site&#8221; cation engineering to tune the LLD degree to an optimal level. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that LLD manipulation suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Conclusively, mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLEDs with a champion EQE of 14.2&#8201;% at 475&#8197;nm have been achieved. Moreover, the devices exhibit excellent operational spectral stability (T50 of 72&#8197;min), representing one of the most efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs reported yet.

         <title>An Electron&#8208;Deficient CpE Iridium(III) Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application to Ether&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complex was developed ([CpEIrI2]2). This complex effectively catalyzed weakly coordinating ether&#8208;directed C&#8722;H amidation reactions under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicated that the high catalytic activity of the [CpEIrI2]2 complex is attributed to its highly electron&#8208;deficient nature.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of an iridium(III) catalyst with an electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadienyl ligand ([CpEIrI2]2) are reported. The [CpEIrI2]2 catalyst was synthesized by complexation of a precursor of the CpE ligand with [Ir(cod)OAc]2, followed by oxidation, desilylation, and removal of the COD ligand. The electron&#8208;deficient [CpEIrI2]2 catalyst enabled C&#8722;H amidation reactions assisted by a weakly coordinating ether directing group. Experimental mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggested that the high catalytic performance of [CpEIrI2]2 is due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature, which accelerates both C&#8722;H activation and IrV&#8208;nitrenoid formation.

         <title>Recent Development of SnII, SbIII&#8208;based Birefringent Material: Crystal Chemistry and Investigation of Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered SnII, SbIII&#8208;based birefringent crystals are systematically summarized in this review, including their structural chemistry, optical properties, as well as structure&#8208;properties relationships. The insight gained from this study provides guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.







Abstract
The combination of SnII or SbIII with &#960;, non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units has produced birefringent crystals with birefringence ranging from 0.005 to 0.468@1064&#8197;nm. It is proven that introducing SnII or SbIII into crystals is a feasible strategy to enlarge the birefringence, which not only promotes the miniaturization of fabricated devices, but also effectively modulates polarized light. Herein, recently discovered SnII, SbIII&#8208;based birefringent crystals with birefringence investigated are summarized, including their crystal structure and optical properties, especially birefringence. This review also presents the influence of SnII, SbIII with stereochemically active lone pair on the optical anisotropy. We hope that this work provides a clear perspective on the crystal chemistry of SnII, SbIII&#8208;based optical functional crystals and promotes the development of new birefringent crystals with large optical anisotropy.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Orderly Assembly of Ir&#8208;atomic Chains to Integrate a Dynamic Reaction Pathway for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we propose an intriguing light&#8208;driven orderly assembly strategy for implanting Ir&#8208;chains and clusters onto catalyst surfaces with different order degrees. Interestingly, the dynamic orbital interaction between orderly Ir&#8208;atomic chains and clusters can be regulated by balancing the dissolution and redisposition rate. As a result, the activation energy in acidic OER can be effectively reduced by integrating a dynamic reaction pathway. This work not only suggests a useful method to design the catalysts at atomic level, but also deepens the understanding about acidic OER kinetics.







Abstract
This work suggests an intriguing light&#8208;driven atomic assembly proposal to orderly configure the distribution of reactive sites to optimize the spin&#8208;entropy&#8208;related orbital interaction and charge transfer from electrocatalysts to intermediates. Herein, the introduced fluorine (F) atoms acting as photo&#8208;corrosion centres in MnO1.9F0.1 effectively soften the bonding interaction of Mn&#8722;O bonds in the IrCl3 solution. Therefore, partial Mn atoms can be successively replaced to form orderly atomic&#8208;hybridized catalysts with a spin&#8208;related low entropy due to the coexistence of Ir&#8208;atomic chains and clusters. The time&#8208;related elemental analysis demonstrates that the dynamic dissolution/redeposition of Ir clusters in acidic oxygen evolution leads to a reintegration of the reaction pathway to seek the switchable rate&#8208;limiting step with a lower activation energy.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Manipulated p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Synergy Enables Efficient Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; synergy is realized by combining phosphine and carbazole groups in three hybrid molecules (xCzTPP). The harmonized p&#8208;electronic feature and steric effect of the phosphine group result in RTP efficiency and lifetime of para&#8208;substituted pCzTPP up to 13.8&#8201;% and 645&#8197;ms, respectively, owing to its sequential and complementary triplet p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; components in intersystem crossing and triplet energy&#8208;transfer processes.







Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) attracts extensive attentions, but still faces the challenge of achieving both high RTP efficiencies (&#951;RTP) and long lifetimes (&#964;RTP), due to the intrinsic contradiction between triplet radiation and stabilization. In this work, we developed three carbazole&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrids named xCzTPP, in which phosphine groups provide nonbonding electrons and steric hindrance to modulate intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. With the rational orientations and spatial positions of functional groups, para&#8208;substituted pCzTPP achieves high &#951;RTP over 10&#8201;% and more than twofold increased &#964;RTP (&gt;600&#8197;ms), compared to ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208; isomers. Theoretical simulation and photophysical investigation indicate that the strongest intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic interplays of pCzTPP harmonize high transition probability of 3p&#960; state and triplet stability of 3&#960;&#960; state, reflecting the p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; synergy in RTP process.

         <title>Vinyl Halide&#8208;Modified Unsaturated Cyclitols are Mechanism&#8208;Based Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclohexene&#8208;based carbohydrate mimics have been shown to react with glycoside hydrolases via positively charged, allylic cation&#8208;like transition states. By incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing halogens at the vinyl position of the allyl ethers of these sugar mimics potent inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases were prepared. This approach is orthogonal to existing strategies and offers a new tool to probe glycosidase active sites.







Abstract
Suitably configured allyl ethers of unsaturated cyclitols act as substrates of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases, reacting via allylic cation transition states. Incorporation of halogens at the vinylic position of these carbasugars, along with an activated leaving group, generates potent inactivators of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases. Enzymatic turnover of these halogenated cyclitols (F, Cl, Br) displayed a counter&#8208;intuitive trend wherein the most electronegative substituents yielded the most labile pseudo&#8208;glycosidic linkages. Structures of complexes with the Sulfolobus &#946;&#8208;glucosidase revealed similar enzyme&#8208;ligand interactions to those seen in complexes with a 2&#8208;fluorosugar inhibitor, the lone exception being displacement of tyrosine 322 from the active site by the halogen. Mutation of Y322 to Y322F largely abolished glycosidase activity, consistent with lost interactions at O5, but minimally affected (7&#8208;fold) rates of carbasugar hydrolysis, yielding a more selective enzyme for unsaturated cyclitol ether hydrolysis.

         <title>Efficient Transformation of Polymer Main Chain Catalyzed by Macrocycle Metal Complexes via Pseudorotaxane Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effects. Developing efficient polymer reactions in artificial systems thus represents a long&#8208;standing objective in the fields of polymer and material science. Here, we show unprecedented macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient polymer reaction that result in 100% transformation of the main chain functional groups presumably via a processive mode reaction. The complete polymer reactions were confirmed in not only intramolecular reaction (hydroamination) but also intermolecular reaction (hydrosilylation) by using Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;catalyzed systems. The most fascinating feature of the both reactions is that higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Various studies suggested that the reactions occur in the catalyst cavity via the formation of a supramolecular complex between the macrocycle catalyst and polymer substrate like pseudorotaxane, which should be of characteristic of the efficient polymer reactions progressing in a processive mode.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination by Cationic&#160;Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral benzylic amines are privileged motifs in pharmacologically active molecules. Intramolecular enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer has emerged as a straightforward, powerful tool for the synthesis of chiral amines, but methods for intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H amination remain elusive. Herein, we report a cationic copper catalytic system for intermolecular enantioselective benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H amination with peroxide as an oxidant. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. More importantly, it can be used to synthesize bioactive molecules, including chiral drugs. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the amination reaction involves benzylic radicals generated by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt Nanoparticles: Phase&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Performance in Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermetallic phase control is a promising strategy to optimize the physicochemical properties of ordered intermetallic compounds and engineer their performance in various (electro)catalytic reactions. However, the intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance is still rarely reported because of the difficulty in synthesizing ordered intermetallics with precisely controlled phase structures at atomic level, especially having ordered mesoscopic structure/morphology. Here, we successfully reported a precise synthesis of two phase&#8208;pure mesoporous intermetallic gallium&#8208;platinum (meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt) nanoparticles, including meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 with an orthorhombic space group and meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 with a non&#8208;symmorphic chiral cubic pace group. The intermetallic phase control of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt nanoparticles was realized by carefully tuning the induced Ga salts with different anions that optimized the free energies during the synthesis. The intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt was systematically evaluated for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis, with completely opposite catalytic performance in alkaline media. Interestingly, ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 catalyst with chiral atomic arrangements disclosed unexpected high ORR activity and stability with 5.9 and 3.2 enhancement factors in mass activity compared to those of meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 and commercial Pt/C.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of NO2 on TiO2: Evidence of a New Source of N2O5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N2O5 is an important intermediate in the atmospheric nitrogen cycle. Using a flow tube reactor, N2O5 was found to be released from the TiO2 surface during the photocatalytic oxidation of NO2, revealing a previously unreported source of N2O5. The rate of N2O5 release from TiO2 was dependent on the initial NO2 concentration, relative humidity, O2/N2 ratio, and irradiation intensity. Experimental evidences and quantum chemical calculations showed that NO2 can react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the generated electron holes on the TiO2, followed by combining with another NO2 molecule to form N2O5. The latter was physisorbed on TiO2 and had a low adsorption energy of &#8208;0.13 eV. Box model simulations indicated that the new source of N2O5 released from TiO2 can increase the daytime N2O5 concentration by up to 20% in urban areas if abundant TiO2&#8208;containing materials and high NOx concentrations were present. This joint experimental/theoretical study not only demonstrates a new chemical mechanism for N2O5 formation but also has important implications for air quality in urban areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Processable Two&#8208;Dimensional Triazine Polymers with Superior Photocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and scalable production of high&#8208;quality and processable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers are highly desired but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient noncovalent functionalization strategy for producing highly uniform, aqueous processable and semiconducting 2D triazine polymers. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the aromatic amphiphilic 1&#8208;pyrenebutyrate can adsorb and intercalate into the interlayer of bulk crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF) through noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the pyrene moiety and the porous basal plane of 2D triazine polymer layer, which greatly facilitate the exfoliation of CTF in water in large scale. The as&#8208;prepared highly water&#8208;dispersible single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be easily processed into ultralight aerogels with a density of 5&#8208;15 mg cm&#8208;3, which can be further shaped into mechanically strong films upon simple compression. This noncovalent functionalization not only improve the dispersibility and processability of 2D triazine polymer, but also optimize its band structure and promote the photogenerated carrier separation via an interesting surface molecule doping effect, thus resulting in a remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1249 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 (24980 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 27.2% at 420 nm for the 2D triazine polymer, outperforming most metal&#8208;free photocatalysts ever reported.</dc:description>

         <title>The Nephelauxetic Effect Becomes an Important Design Factor for Photoactive First&#8208;Row Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The expansion of d&#8208;orbitals as a result of metal&#8208;ligand bond covalence, the so&#8208;called nephelauxetic effect, is a well&#8208;established concept of coordination chemistry, yet its importance for the design of new photoactive complexes based on first&#8208;row transition metals is only beginning to be recognized. Until recently, much focus has been on optimizing the ligand field strength, coordination geometries, and molecular rigidity, but now it becomes evident that the nephelauxetic effect can be a game changer regarding the photophysical properties of 3d metal complexes in solution at room temperature. In Cr(III) and Mn(IV) complexes with the d3 valence electron configuration, the nephelauxetic effect was exploited to shift the well&#8208;known ruby&#8208;like red luminescence to the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. In Fe(II) and Co(III) complexes with the low&#8208;spin d6 electron configuration, charge&#8208;transfer excited states were stabilized with respect to detrimental metal&#8208;centered excited states, to improve their properties and to enhance their application potential. In isoelectronic (3d6) isocyanide complexes of Cr(0) and Mn(I), the nephelauxetic effect is likely at play as well, enabling luminescence and other favorable photoreactivity. This minireview illustrates the broad applicability of the nephelauxetic effect in tailoring the photophysical and photochemical properties of new coordination compounds made from abundant first&#8208;row transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Noninvasive Early Diagnosing of Allograft Rejection by a Granzyme B Protease Responsive NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early diagnosis of allograft rejection helps to improve the immune&#8208;related management of transplant recipients. The clinically&#8208;used core needle biopsy method is invasive and subject to sampling error. In vivo fluorescence imaging for monitoring immune&#8208;related processes has the advantages of non&#8208;invasiveness, fast feedback and high sensitivity. Herein, we report a responsive second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent nanosensor (ErGZ) to detect early allograft rejection. ErGZ allows ratiometric in vivo fluorescence sensing of granzyme B, which is overexpressed in recipients&#8217; T cells during the onset of rejection. The sensor demonstrates efficacious detection of allograft rejection with high sensitivity and specificity, which accomplishes non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of rejection in skin and deep buried islets transplant mice models 2 d and 5 d earlier than biopsy, by in vivo fluorescence imaging and urinary detection, respectively, providing a valuable approach for therapeutical management.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a responsive second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescent nanosensor (ErGZ) to detect early allograft rejection. ErGZ allows ratiometric in vivo fluorescence sensing of granzyme B, which is overexpressed in recipients&#8217; T cells during the onset of rejection. The sensor demonstrates efficacious detection of allograft rejection with high sensitivity and specificity, which accomplishes non-invasive diagnosis of rejection in skin and deep buried islets transplant mice models 2 d and 5 d earlier than biopsy, by in vivo fluorescence imaging and urinary detection, respectively, providing a valuable approach for therapeutical management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mobile Molecules: Reactivity Profiling Guides Faster Movement on a Cysteine Track</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical stepping of biopolymers within a protein nanopore suggests an enzymeless means of sequence characterization. Using a nanoreactor approach, we elucidated the reactivity profile of cysteine footholds along a protein track. Faster chemical stepping was achieved by rational mutagenesis and optimization of reaction conditions. In the future, the system has the potential for directional molecular motion at milliseconds per step.







Abstract
We previously reported a molecular hopper, which makes sub&#8208;nanometer steps by thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange along a track with cysteine footholds within a protein nanopore. Here we optimize the hopping rate (ca. 0.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the previous work) with a view towards rapid enzymeless biopolymer characterization during translocation within nanopores. We first took a single&#8208;molecule approach to obtain the reactivity profiles of individual footholds. The pKa values of cysteine thiols within a pore ranged from 9.17 to 9.85, and the pH&#8208;independent rate constants of the thiolates with a small&#8208;molecule disulfide varied by up to 20&#8208;fold. Through site&#8208;specific mutagenesis and a pH increase from 8.5 to 9.5, the overall hopping rate of a DNA cargo along a five&#8208;cysteine track was accelerated 4&#8208;fold, and the rate&#8208;limiting step 21&#8208;fold.

         <title>Electrode materials for desalination of water via capacitive deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have seen the emergence of capacitive deionization (CDI) as a promising desalination technique for converting sea and wastewater into potable water, due to its energy efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, its low salt removal capacity and parasitic reactions have limited its effectiveness. As a result, the development of porous carbon nanomaterials as electrode materials have been explored, while taking into account of material characteristics such as morphology, wettability, high conductivity, chemical robustness, cyclic stability, specific surface area, and ease of production. To tackle the parasitic reaction issue, membrane capacitive deionization (mCDI) was proposed which utilizes ion&#8208;exchange membranes coupled to the electrode. Fabrication techniques along with the experimental parameters used to evaluate the desalination performance of different materials are discussed in this review to provide an overview of improvements made for CDI and mCDI desalination purposes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reaction for the &#946;&#8208;selective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from glycals is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions by a radical pathway and may inspire the development of similar stereoselective coupling reactions, particularly in the field of carbohydrate synthesis.







Abstract
We report a ligand&#8208;controlled CoII&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling hydroalkylation for direct and &#946;&#8208;selective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from glycals. This reaction proceeds by a radical pathway for alkyl halide activation and is &#946;&#8208;selective through ligand control. This approach may inspire the development of further stereoselective coupling reactions with potential application in the field of carbohydrates.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Oxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation is reported. A broad range of alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and characterized, and was found to be a key intermediate in this reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base.







Abstract
Metalla&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenation represents one of the most straightforward and sustainable approaches to access valuable oxygenated molecules. Despite the significant advances, the development of enantioselective electrochemical C&#8722;H oxygenation reaction is very challenging and remains elusive. Herein, we described the first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation. A broad range of enantioenriched alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). An unusual cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and fully characterized, which was proven to be a key intermediate of this C&#8722;H alkoxylation reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base and the whole process proceeded through a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Introduction of Bioorthogonal Handles to Nanopores by Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the genetic code expansion strategy, an azido amino acid is site&#8208;specifically incorporated into a biological nanopore and served as a &#8220;chemical clasp&#8221;, enabling bioorthogonal conjugation of DNA or proteins to generate nanopore sensors with novel sensing capacities. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific functionalization of natural amino acid&#8208;containing biological nanopores is pivotal in single molecule sensing. However, pore engineering methodologies are restricted to a limited choice and introduction of unnatural chemical components is extremely difficult. Herein we report the genetic code expansion (GCE) strategy to introduce unnatural amino acid (UAA) to an octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. GCE allows for rapid and efficient introduction of bioorthogonal reactive site (i.e., azide) to the pore rim, and conjugation of single stranded DNA or lysozyme was demonstrated. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further used for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides, demonstrating a sensing capacity that a bare MspA nanopore does not possess. GCE with bioorthogonal handles, which has never been previously applied in the preparation of nanopores, is a versatile strategy for pore engineering and may further expand the application scenarios of nanopores.

The high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with peak external quantum efficiency exceeding 15&#8201;% is attained by the use of a synergetic modulation strategy, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, via the incorporation of a bifunctional molecular additive.







Abstract
Achieving efficient blue electroluminescence (EL) remains the fundamental challenge that impedes perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) towards commercial applications. The bottleneck accounting for the inefficient blue PeLEDs is broadly attributed to the poor&#8208;emissive blue perovskite emitters based on either mixed halide engineering or reduced&#8208;dimensional strategy. Herein, we report the high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (490&#8197;nm) with the maximum EQE exceeding 15&#8201;% by incorporating a molecular modifier, namely 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Difluorophenone, for significantly suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and tuning of the low&#8208;dimensional phase distribution of quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskites, which represents a remarkable paradigm for developing the new generation of blue lighting sources.

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Structural Transformation of a 4&#8208;Ravel Containing Four Crossings and Featuring Cp*Rh/Ir Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings have been generated using a single&#8208;step strategy. This topology is achieved by utilizing parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions with carefully selected naphthoquinoyl Cp*M building blocks and X&#8208;shaped pyridyl ligands.







Abstract
Intricately interwoven topologies are continually being synthesized and are ultimately equally versatile and significant at the nanoscale level; however, reports concerning ravel structures, which are highly entwined new topological species, are extremely rare and fraught with tremendous synthesis challenges. To solve the synthesis problem, a tetrapodontic pyridine ligand L1 with two types of olefinic bond units and two Cp*M&#8208;based building blocks (E1, M=Rh; E2, M=Ir) featuring large conjugated planes was prepared to perform the self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings were obtained by parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in a single&#8208;step strategy. Remarkably, reversible structural transformations between the 4&#8208;ravel and the corresponding metallocage could be realized by concentration changes and solvent&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced effects. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy provide full confirmation of these phenomena.

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;Mediated Regenerable FeII Active Sites for Efficient Uranium Extraction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work coupled electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox with uranium extraction and realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2. The findings also provide inspirations for other metal resource recovery applications.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;reduced iron (NRI) is a promising uranium adsorbent due to its strong reducibility and good selectivity, but it still faces the challenges of slow kinetics, limited and non&#8208;renewable active sites. In this work, we realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2 solution by coupling electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox and uranium extraction. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency of NRI after electrochemical uranium extraction (EUE) could reach 452&#8197;mg/g and 99.1&#8201;%, respectively. Combined with quasi&#8208;operando/operando characterization technologies, we clarified the mechanism of EUE and revealed that continuously regenerating FeII active sites by electroreduction could significantly enhance the property of EUE. This work here provides a new electrochemical mediated and low energy consumption uranium extraction strategy which also provides a reference for other metal resource recovery.

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;strength cellulose&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte was developed with high Li+ conductivity, Li+ transference number (0.85) and excellent interface stability. The delicate design results in an unprecedented 1200 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C and 25&#176;C is achieved for the assembled solid&#8208;state batteries, which provides a crucial solution for the industrial production of next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting their commercial application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (C&#8208;CLA QPE) was developed with a high Li+ transference number (
) of 0.85 and excellent interface stability. The prepared LiFePO4 (LFP)|C&#8208;CLA QPE|Li batteries exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 97.7&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. The experimental results and Density Function Theory (DFT) simulation revealed that the partially esterified side groups in the CLA matrix contribute to the migration of Li+ and enhance electrochemical stability. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost&#8208;effective, stable polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Hemin as a General Static Dark Quencher for Constructing Heme Oxygenase&#8208;1 Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemin was identified as a broad&#8208;spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) and highly efficient (quenching efficiency &gt;97&#8201;%) dark quencher for designing &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probes. Based on this initial discovery, the first live cell&#8208;applicable fluorescent probe of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) was disclosed and a convenient fluoroassay was developed for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in biological samples.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule probes suitable for live&#8208;cell applications remains challenging yet highly desirable. We report the first fluorescent probe, RBH, for imaging the heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) activity in live cells after discovering hemin as a universal dark quencher. Hemin works via a static quenching mechanism and shows high quenching efficiency (&gt;97&#8201;%) with fluorophores across a broad spectrum (&#955;ex=400&#8211;700&#8197;nm). The favorable properties of RBH (e.g. long excitation/emission wavelengths, fast response rate and high magnitude of signal increase) enable its use for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in complex biological samples. As HO&#8208;1 is involved in regulating antioxidant defence, iron homeostasis and gasotransmitter carbon monoxide production, we expect RBH to be a powerful tool for dissecting its functions. Also, the discovery of hemin as a general static dark quencher provides a straightforward strategy for constructing novel fluorescent probes for diverse biological species.

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric and Regiodivergent N1&#8208; and C3&#8208;Allenylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first direct catalytic asymmetric N1&#8208;functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles via an allenylic alkylation strategy. This transformation produces N&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. We also introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.







Abstract
Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic alkylation strategy for the direct functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles by employing P&#8208;chiral BIBOP&#8208;type ligands. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. Using Cs2CO3 at elevated temperatures in MeCN, N1&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen are produced in good yields with high enantioselectivity and complete N1&#8208;regioselectivity regardless of the electronic properties and substitution patterns of diverse indoles. Using K2CO3 at room temperature in CH2Cl2, chiral C3&#8208;alkylated indoles can also be obtained. Notably, we introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles that proceeded through different pathways from di&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Trisubstituted Carbocyclic Olefins: An Access to Chiral Cyclic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral cyclic amides has been achieved via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the corresponding enamides with a high degree of enantioselectivity. This methodology extends the utilization of earth abundant metal catalysis in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic enamides has been achieved using an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. Using CoCl2/(S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE, several trisubstituted carbocyclic enamides were reduced with high activity and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to the corresponding saturated amides. The methodology can be extended to the synthesis of chiral amines by base hydrolysis of the hydrogenation products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal the presence of a high spin cobalt (II) species in the catalytic cycle. We propose that the hydrogenation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond proceeds via a sigma&#8208;bond&#8208;metathesis pathway.

         <title>Detachable Porous Organic Polymers Responsive to Light and Heat</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material was prepared based on the detachment mechanism. The detachable porous polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, was fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer with the irradiation of 365&#8197;nm UV light and it can detach into the monomer with the irradiation of 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. The detachment results in a large difference in porosity and adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials have captured much attention due to the on&#8208;demand tunable properties. Most reported stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials are based on molecule isomerism or host&#8208;guest interaction, and it is highly desired to develop new types based on different responsive mechanism. Herein, inspired by natural cells which have the ability to fuse and divide induced by external stimulation, we report a new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material based on detachment mechanism. A detachable porous organic polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, is fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer (AnMon) when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light. DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1 can detach into the monomer AnMon when irradiated with 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. Such polymerization/detachment is reversible. The detachment results in a big difference in porosity and adsorption capacity, making the present detachable porous polymer highly promising in adsorptive separation and drug delivery.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Mavacuran Alkaloids through Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;Addition of an Organolithium Reagent
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor enabled the synthesis of six mavacuran alkaloids with a highly strained pentacyclic cagelike framework. The chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the reaction were rationalized by DFT calculations. Dihydroxylation and pinacol rearrangement of the indole nucleus completed the first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine.







Abstract
We report a synthetic endeavor towards the highly strained pentacyclic caged framework of the mavacuran alkaloids which culminated with the concise total synthesis of C&#8208;fluorocurine, C&#8208;profluorocurine, C&#8208;mavacurine, normavacurine, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;pleiocarpamine and taberdivarine H. We designed a strategy involving late&#8208;stage construction of the D ring by Michael addition of a vinylic nucleophile to a 2&#8208;indolyl acrylate moiety. While the intramolecular Michael addition did not succeed, we were able to perform a diastereoselective unusual intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor with the assistance of the piperidine nitrogen atom through the formation of a complex as suggested by DFT computations. Final cyclization was achieved by nucleophilic substitution to form an ammonium intermediate. The first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine were finalized by the dihydroxylation of C&#8208;mavacurine and a pinacol rearrangement, respectively.

         <title>Nickel(II) Nitrate Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Single&#8208;Junction Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with a Record 19.02&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

A facile strategy was developed to improve the film quality of a solution processed nickel(II) nitrate hole transporting layer, which realized a record efficiency of 19.02&#8201;% for the binary blend bulk heterojunction organic solar cells to date.







Abstract
A facile strategy was developed here to improve the film quality of nickel&#8208;based hole transporting layer (HTL) for efficient organic solar cell (OSC) applications. To prevent the agglomeration of Ni(NO3)2 during film deposition, acetylacetonate was added into the precursor solution, which led to the formation of an amorphous and glass&#8208;like state. After thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the film&#8208;forming ability could be further improved. The additional UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatment continuously improved the film quality and increased the work function and conductivity of such HTL. The resulting TA &amp; UVO modified Ni(NO3)2 &amp; Hacac HTL produced highly efficient organic solar cells with exciting power conversion efficiencies of 18.42&#8201;% and 19.02&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Th devices, respectively, much higher than the control PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS devices.

         <title>Magnetism in Nonplanar Zigzag Edge Termini of Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended 7&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon with unique termini structures was synthesized on Au(111) using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. A Kondo resonance was observed for termini with nonplanar zigzag edges even on a bare Au(111) surface. DFT calculations revealed that the recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag terminus resulted from its weak interaction with the Au(111) because of its nonplanar conformation.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and nanographenes synthesized by on&#8208;surface reactions using tailor&#8208;made molecular precursors offer an ideal playground for a study of magnetism towards nano&#8208;spintronics. Although the zigzag edge of GNRs has been known to host magnetism, the underlying metal substrates usually veil the edge&#8208;induced Kondo effect. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of unprecedented, &#960;&#8208;extended 7&#8208;armchair GNRs using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. Characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy revealed unique rearrangement reactions leading to pentagon&#8208; or pentagon/heptagon&#8208;incorporated, nonplanar zigzag termini, which demonstrated Kondo resonances even on bare Au(111). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the nonplanar structure significantly reduces the interaction between the zigzag terminus and the Au(111) surface, leading to a recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag edge. Such a distortion of planar GNR structures offers a degree of freedom to control the magnetism on metal substrates.

         <title>A Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for OER and ORR based on a Cobalt(II) Triazole Pyridine Bis&#8208;[Cobalt(III) Corrole] Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing the structure of the catalyst, possessing CoII and CoIII reaction centers, we achieve nearly 100&#8201;% selective activity during ORR to H2O2. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% for oxygen evolution, and an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 combined with a superior stability.







Abstract
As alternative energy sources are essential to reach a climate&#8208;neutral economy, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as futuristic energy carrier gains enormous awareness. However, seeking for stable and electrochemically selective H2O2 ORR electrocatalyst is yet a challenge, making the design of&#8212;ideally&#8212;bifunctional catalysts extremely important and outmost of interest. In this study, we explore the application of a trimetallic cobalt(II) triazole pyridine bis&#8208;[cobalt(III) corrole] complex CoIITP[CoIIIC]2 3 in OER and ORR catalysis due to its remarkable physicochemical properties, fast charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical reversibility, and durability. With nearly 100&#8201;% selective catalytic activity towards the two&#8208;electron transfer generated H2O2, an ORR onset potential of 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE and a cycling stability of 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles are detected. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, Faraday efficiency 98&#8201;% for oxygen, an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 combined with superior stability.

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Nitroalkane Addition to Unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first intermolecular enantioselective addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is described, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. This fundamental synthetically relevant transformation proceeds with high enantiomeric excesses and yields over a wide range of feedstock substrates, providing pharmaceutically relevant building blocks in a single step.







Abstract
Herein we describe the enantioselective intermolecular conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. The transformation provides the most direct access to pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroesters, utilizing feedstock chemicals, with unprecedented selectivity. The methodology exhibits a broad substrate scope, including &#946;&#8208;(fluoro)alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl substituted electrophiles, and was successfully applied on a gram scale with reduced catalyst loading, and, additionally, catalyst recovery was carried out. The formal synthesis of a range of drug molecules, and an enantioselective synthesis of (S)&#8208;rolipram were achieved. Additionally, computational studies revealed key reaction intermediates and transition state structures, and provided rationale for high enantioselectivities, in good agreement with experimental results.

         <title>Multi&#8208;layer 3D Chirality and Double&#8208;Helical Assembly in a Copper Nanocluster with a Triple&#8208;Helical Cu15 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conceptually mimicking biomolecules&#8217; ability to construct multiple&#8208;helical aggregates with emergent properties and functions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we report an atom&#8208;precise 18&#8208;copper nanocluster (NC), Cu18H(PET)14(TPP)6(NCS)3 ( Cu18H ) which contains a pseudo D3&#8208;symmetrical triple&#8208;helical Cu15 core. Structurally, Cu18H may be also viewed as sandwich type of sulfur&#8208;bridged chiral copper cluster units [Cu6&#8208;Cu6&#8208;Cu6], endowing three&#8208;layered 3D chirality. More importantly, the chiral NCs are aggregated into an infinite double&#8208;stranded helix supported by intra&#8208;strand homonuclear C&#8210;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8210;Cdihydrogen contacts and inter&#8208;strand C&#8208;H/&#960; and C&#8208;H/S interactions. The unique multi&#8208;layered 3D chirality and the double&#8208;helical assembly of Cu18H are evocative of DNA. Moreover, the collective behaviours of the aggregated NCs not only exhibit crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effects in the deep&#8208;red region, but also efficiently catalyzes electron transfer (ET) reaction. This study thus presents that hierarchical assemblies of atomically defined copper NCs could be intricate as observed for important biomolecules like DNA with emergent properties arising from aggregated behaviours.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Difunctionalized cyclobutanes are an emerging scaffold in medicinal chemistry that can confer beneficial pharmacological properties to small&#8208;molecule drug candidates. However, the diastereocontrolled synthesis of these compounds typically requires complicated synthetic routes, indicating a need for novel methods. Here, we report a sequential C&#8211;H/C&#8211;C functionalization strategy for the stereospecific synthesis of cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;functionalized cyclobutyl ketones from readily available cyclobutyl aryl ketones. Specifically, a bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol intermediate is generated from the parent cyclobutyl ketone via an optimized Norrish&#8208;Yang procedure. This intermediate then undergoes a ligand&#8208;enabled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;C cleavage/functionalization to produce valuable cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;(hetero)arylated, alkenylated, and alkynylated cyclobutyl aryl ketones, the benzoyl moiety of which can subsequently be converted to a wide range of functional groups including amides and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Molecular Mechanism for Enhanced Longevity of Supramolecular Vesicular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is a promising strategy for stabilizing the photo&#8208;sensitive components in photocatalysis. However, the underlying correlation between the enhanced photostability and supramolecular structure at the molecular level has not yet been fully understood. Herein, we develop a biomimetic vesicular membrane&#8208;based polyporphyrin photocatalyst exhibiting excellent photocatalytic stability with at least activity time of 240 h in hydrogen generation. Time&#8208;domain ab Initio modelling together with transient absorption spectroscopy, visual frontier orbitals and Gibbs free energy calculation disclose that the ordered aggregation of porphyrin units in the vesicle membrane facilitates &#8220;hot&#8221; electron relaxation, a longer photo&#8208;generated carrier lifetime and the rapid dissipation of photo&#8208;generated charges, which contribute to the longevity. This work deepens the molecular&#8208;level understanding on photostability and photocatalytic mechanism of supramolecular photocatalysts.</dc:description>

Machine learning algorithms are currently emerging as powerful tools in all areas of science. This review covers atomistic machine learning approaches in chemistry beyond the conventional data&#8208;driven perspective.







Abstract
Machine learning (ML) algorithms are currently emerging as powerful tools in all areas of science. Conventionally, ML is understood as a fundamentally data&#8208;driven endeavour. Unfortunately, large well&#8208;curated databases are sparse in chemistry. In this contribution, I therefore review science&#8208;driven ML approaches which do not rely on &#8220;big data&#8221;, focusing on the atomistic modelling of materials and molecules. In this context, the term science&#8208;driven refers to approaches that begin with a scientific question and then ask what training data and model design choices are appropriate. As key features of science&#8208;driven ML, the automated and purpose&#8208;driven collection of data and the use of chemical and physical priors to achieve high data&#8208;efficiency are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of appropriate model evaluation and error estimation is emphasized.

         <title>Understanding MOF Flexibility: An Analysis Focused on Pillared Layer MOFs as a Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible porous frameworks are at the forefront of materials research. A unique feature is their ability to open and close their pores in an adaptive manner induced by chemical and physical stimuli. Such enzyme&#8208;like selective recognition offers a wide range of functions ranging from gas storage and separation to sensing, actuation, mechanical energy storage and catalysis. However, the factors affecting switchability are poorly understood. In particular, the role of building blocks, as well as secondary factors (crystal size, defects, cooperativity) and the role of host&#8208;guest interactions, profit from systematic investigations of an idealized model by advanced analytical techniques and simulations. The review describes an integrated approach targeting the deliberate design of pillared layer metal&#8208;organic frameworks as idealized model materials for the analysis of critical factors affecting framework dynamics and summarizes the resulting progress in their understanding and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Deposit Analysis in Catalyst Deactivation, Regeneration, and Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbon conversion catalysts suffer&#160;from&#160;deactivation&#160;by&#160;deposition or formation of carbon deposits.&#160;Carbondeposit formation&#160;is thermodynamically favored above 350&#160;&#176;C, even in hydrogen&#8208;rich environments.&#160;We discuss four&#160;basic mechanisms: a&#160;carbenium&#8208;ion based&#160;mechanism&#160;taking place on acid sites of zeolites&#160;or&#160;bifunctional catalysts, a&#160;metal&#8208;induced&#160;formation of soft coke (i.e.,&#160;oligomers of small olefins) on bifunctional catalysts, a&#160;radical&#8208;mediatedmechanism in higher&#8208;temperature processes, and fast&#8208;growing carbon filament formation.&#160;Catalysts&#160;deactivatebecause carbon deposits block pores at different length scales, or directly block active sites. Some deactivated catalysts can be re&#8208;used,&#160;others&#160;can&#160;be regenerated&#160;or&#160;have to be discarded.

         <title>Combining MN6 Octahedra and PN5 Trigonal Bipyramids in the Mica&#8208;like Nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M = Al, In)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered silicates are a very versatile class of materials with high importance to humanity. The new nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M = Al, In), synthesized from MCl3, P3N5 and NH4N3 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 1100 &#176;C and 8 GPa, show a mica&#8208;like layer setup and feature rare nitrogen coordination motifs. The crystal structure of AlP6N11 was elucidated from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group Cm (no. 8), a = 4.9354(10), b = 8.1608(16), c = 9.0401(18) &#197;, &#946; = 98.63(3)&#176;), enabling Rietveld refinement of isotypic InP6N11. It is built up from layers of PN4 tetrahedra, PN5 trigonal bipyramids and MN6 octahedra. PN5 trigonal bipyramids have been reported only once and MN6 octahedra are sparsely found in the literature. AlP6N11 was further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX), IR and NMR spectroscopy. Despite the vast amount of known layered silicates, there is no isostructural compound to MP6N11 as yet.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrode potential driven dissociation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 adducts: a possible manifestation of the electro&#8208;inductive effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, non&#8208;Faradaic effects were used to modify the electronic structure and reactivity of electrode&#8208;bound species. We hypothesize that these electrostatic perturbations could influence the chemical reactivity of electrolyte species near an electrode in the absence of Faradaic electron transfer. A prime example of non&#8208;Faradaic effects is acid&#8208;base dissociation near an interface. Here, we probed the near&#8208;electrode dissociation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 Lewis adducts upon electrode polarization, well outside of the redox potential window of the adducts. Using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, we detected a potential&#8208;dependent depletion of the adduct near the electrode. We propose an electro&#8208;inductive effect where a more positive potential leads to electron withdrawal on the N&#8208;heterocycle. This study takes a step forward in the use of electrostatics at electrochemical interfaces for field&#8208;driven electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early&#8208;Onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preeclampsia is a heterogenous and multiorgan cardiovascular disorder of pregnancy. Here, we report the development of a novel strip&#8208;based lateral flow assay (LFA) using lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting two different biomarkers for detection of preeclampsia. We first measured circulating plasma FKBPL and CD44 protein concentrations from individuals with early&#8208;onset preeclampsia (EOPE), using ELISA. We confirmed that the CD44/FKBPL ratio is reduced in EOPE with a good diagnostic potential. Using our rapid LFA prototypes, we achieved an improved lower limit of detection: 10 pg/ml for FKBPL and 15 pg/ml for CD44, which is more than one order lower than the standard ELISA method. Using clinical samples, a cut&#8208;off value of 1.24 for CD44/FKBPL ratio provided positive predictive value of 100% and the negative predictive value of 91%. Our LFA shows promise as a rapid and highly sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care test for preeclampsia.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Preeclampsia is a heterogenous and multiorgan cardiovascular disorder of pregnancy. Here, we report the development of a novel strip-based lateral flow assay (LFA) using lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting two different biomarkers for detection of preeclampsia. We first measured circulating plasma FKBPL and CD44 protein concentrations from individuals with early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE), using ELISA. We confirmed that the CD44/FKBPL ratio is reduced in EOPE with a good diagnostic potential. Using our rapid LFA prototypes, we achieved an improved lower limit of detection: 10 pg/ml for FKBPL and 15 pg/ml for CD44, which is more than one order lower than the standard ELISA method. Using clinical samples, a cut-off value of 1.24 for CD44/FKBPL ratio provided positive predictive value of 100% and the negative predictive value of 91%. Our LFA shows promise as a rapid and highly sensitive point-of-care test for preeclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalysis as an Effective Tool for Upcycling Polymers into Value&#8208;Added Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shaping a sustainable future is closely tied to the development of advanced plastic recycling technologies. As global recycling rates remain low, the lion&#8217;s share of post&#8208;consumer plastics is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. This unbalanced plastic waste management not only poses severe environmental risks, but also entails an irrevocable loss of chemical resources that are embedded in synthetic polymers. To give plastic waste a new life, a series of photocatalytic methods has recently been reported that convert polymers directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. These approaches operate at ambient temperature, show high reactivity/selectivity, and provide alternative reaction pathways as compared to thermal depolymerizations. This Minireview highlights the scientific breakthroughs in upcycling polymers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis under environmentally benign conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photodynamic Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Therapy and Metastasis Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable phototheranostics hold potential for precision cancer treatment with minimized side effects due to specific &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signal and phototoxicity. Particularly, there is a growing interest to develop chemiluminescence (CL) phototheranostic probes because of minimized tissue autofluorescence; however, current probes are based on nanoparticles composed of multiple components to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) CL imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy owing to the lack of NIR absorbing chemiluminophores. We herein report the design and synthesis of bright unimolecular chemiluminophores with NIR absorption (~ 650 nm) and emission (&#8805; 700 nm), long CL half&#8208;lives, and ideal photodynamic efficiency. One optimal chemiluminophore is further modified into an activatable probe (DBPOL), whose CL signal and photodynamic activity are only turned on in the presence of a cancer biomarker. Due to the high sensitivity and biomarker specificity, DBPOL permits CL&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), which completely inhibits the tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse models. Moreover, DBPOL can be applied for noninvasive monitoring of lung metastasis. Thus, this study provides molecular guidelines for NIR&#8208;absorbing chemiluminophores with the structural versatility for imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Triplet Excited States of Organic Semiconductors via Tuning Molecular Conformation for Dual&#8208;ratiometric Thermometers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength of noncovalent intramolecular interactions was fine&#8208;tuned to systematically modulate the triplet states, resulting in efficient room temperature phosphorescence and two well&#8208;separated emission bands. An unprecedent organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of two bands, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy.







Abstract
The dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometry is one of highly accurate methods for microscopic thermal measurement in biological systems. Herein, a series of chromone derivatives with noncovalently intramolecular interactions (NIIs) were designed and synthesized for ratiometric thermometers. The triplet states of these organic compounds were systematically tuned upon regulating the conformation with NIIs to yield efficient room temperature phosphorescence and large wavelength difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence simultaneously. As a result, an unprecedent organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on the intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of fluorescence/phosphorescence vs temperature, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy. This work provides a novel method to achieve organic dual ratiometric thermometers via tuning the triplet excited states.

         <title>Burning Graphite Faster than Carbon Black: A Case of Diffusion Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through careful control of total diffusion&#8208;limited regime, it is possible to purify carbon black at the expense of far more stable graphite. This shows that targeted exploitation of total diffusion may be used to bypass the classical chemical reactivity. This represents a new technique for materials purification or synthesis not allowed by other methods.







Abstract
External diffusion may be exploited as a tool to purify materials in a way thought to be inaccessible from a chemical reactivity point of view. A mixture of two carbonaceous materials, graphite and carbon black, are thermally oxidized in either i) outside total diffusion&#8208;limited regime or ii) total diffusion&#8208;limited regime. Depending on the treatment applied it is possible to purify either graphite, a trivial task, or carbon black, a task thought impossible. Introducing geometrical selectivity, controlled total diffusion&#8208;limited chemistry exceeds by far the field of carbon materials and can be used as an engineering tool for many materials purification, original synthesis, or to introduce asymmetry in a system. Several examples for direct applications of the findings are mentioned.

         <title>Upcycling of Polybutadiene Facilitated by Selenium&#8208;Mediated Allylic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling via the direct chemical functionalization of a commodity polymer is a promising strategy that introduces new value&#8208;added properties without destroying the parent backbone. This work harnesses the power of selenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization chemistry for the selective allylic amination of 1,4&#8208;polybutadiene, without alkene saturation or transposition, to tune thermal and surface wetting properties.







Abstract
Accumulation of end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics presents ongoing environmental concerns. One strategy to solve this grand challenge is to invent new techniques that modify post&#8208;consumer waste and impart new functionality. While promising approaches for the chemical upcycling of commodity polyolefins and polyaromatics exist, analogous approaches to repurpose unsaturated polymers (e.g., polybutadiene) are scarce. In this work, we propose a method to upcycle polybutadiene, one of the most widely used commercial rubbers, via a mild, metal&#8208;free allylic amination reaction. The resulting materials have tunable thermal and surface wetting properties as a function of both sulfonamide identity and grafting density. Importantly, this approach maintains the parent alkene microstructure without evidence of olefin reduction, olefin transposition, and/or chain scission. Based on these findings, we anticipate future applications in the remediation of complex elastomers and vulcanized rubbers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the diphosphine&#8208;cobalt&#8208;zinc catalytic system, an efficient asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been realized. In particular, the Ph&#8208;BPE ligand can achieve convergent asymmetric hydrogenation of E/Z&#8208;substrates. High yields and excellent enantioselectivities were obtained for both acyclic and cyclic enamides bearing &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl substituents. Hydrogenated products can be applied for the synthesis of useful chiral drugs such as Arfromoterol, Rotigotine, and Norsertraline. In addition, reasonable catalytic mechanism and stereocontrol mode are proposed based on DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction for Preparing&#160;Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a formidable challenge in polycondensation to simultaneously construct multiple covalent bonds to prepare double&#8208;stranded polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with fused multicyclic linkages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction for successfully preparing double&#8208;stranded PIMs with fused multicyclic backbone structures. A self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed based on the [4+2] cycloaddition of sym&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyne (DIBOD) and ortho&#8208;quinone compounds. In this reaction, the cycloaddition of ortho&#8208;quinone with the first alkyne of DIBOD activates the second alkyne, which reacts with ortho&#8208;quinone at a rate constant 192 times larger than that of the original alkyne. Using this self&#8208;accelerating reaction to polymerize DIBOD and spirocyclic/cyclic difunctional ortho&#8208;quinone monomers, a novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization method was developed to prepare PIMs. The resultant PIMs possess intrinsic ultramicropores with pore sizes between 0.45 to 0.7 nm, high specific surface areas above 646 m2/g, and good H2 separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;stable Organoradical Boron Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both organic radicals and organoboron reagents have been broadly investigated, but the combination of them via direct C&#8211;H borylation as organic radical building blocks has never been achieved. Herein, a series of organoradical boron reagents, such as TTM&#8208;Bpin and TTM&#8208;BOH, were synthesized through the key step of C&#8211;H borylation of substrate TTM&#8208;H ((2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl) bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl) radical for the first time. They are air stable enough to be stored in the solid state for several months under dark conditions, and fully investigated through single crystal analysis, EPR and DFT calculations. Furthermore, they can smoothly work in the standard Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction with retention of the carbon radical center. Meanwhile, these radical species bearing different boron units display fluorescent character and are potentially applied for the collective synthesis of luminescent organic radicals, as well as other functionalized open&#8208;shell materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Redox Chemistry of p&#8208;Type Poly(vinyldimethylphenazine) Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free organic electrode materials have attracted vast research attention owing to their designable structures and tunable electrochemical properties. Although n&#8208;type cathode materials could be used in various metal&#8208;ion batteries, p&#8208;type ones with high potential can deliver high energy density. Herein, we report a new p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenazine) (PVDMP), with a theoretical capacity of 227 mAh g&#8722;1. PVDMP featuring two&#8208;step redox reaction will be doped by two anions to maintain electroneutrality during oxidation, which resulted in an anion&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior of PVDMP&#8208;based cathode. The suitable dopant anion for PVDMP was selected and the doping mechanism was confirmed. Under the optimized condition, PVDMP cathode can deliver a high initial capacity of 220 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C and even remains 150 mAh g&#8722;1 after 3900 cycles. This work not only provides a new kind of p&#8208;type organic cathode materials but also deepens the understanding of its anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Metal Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mediated Allene Functionalization by Cobalt and Titanium Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reactions have proven to be a powerful method for alkene functionalization. This work reports the discovery of Co&#8208;porphines as highly efficient MHAT catalysts with a loading of only 0.01 mol% for unprecedented chemoselective allene functionalization under photoirradiation. Moreover, the newly developed bimetallic strategy by the combination of photo Co&#8208;MHAT and Ti catalysis enabled the successful carbonyl allylation with a wide range of amino, oxy, thio, aryl, and alkyl&#8208;allenes providing expedient access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols in over 100 examples with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations supported that selectively transferring hydrogen atoms from cobalt hydride to allenes and generating allyl radicals is the key step in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent scrambling in porous polyarylthioethers through a stepwise SNAr for tunable bandgap and porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous poly(aryl thioether)s offer stability and electronic tunability by robust sulfur&#8208;aryl conjugated architecture, but synthetic access is hindered due to limited control over the nucleophilic nature of sulfides and the air sensitivity of aromatic thiols. Here, we report a simple, one&#8208;pot, inexpensive, regioselective synthesis of highly porous poly(aryl thioether)s through polycondensation of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide. The unprecedented temperature&#8208;dependent para&#8208;directing formation of thioether linkages leads to a stepwise transition of the polymer extension into a network, thereby allowing fine control of the porosity and optical bandgaps. The obtained porous organic polymers with ultra&#8208;microporosity (&lt;1 nm) and sulfur as the surface functional groups show size&#8208;dependent separation of organic micropollutants and selective removal of mercury ions from water. Our findings offer easy access to poly(aryl thioether)s with accessible sulfur functionalities and higher complexity, which will help in realizing advanced synthetic designs in applications such as adsorption, (photo)catalysis, and (opto)electronics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have demonstrated that the catalytic and enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement can be carried out on (vinylcyclopropyl)acetaldehydes through activation via enamine intermediates. The reaction makes use of racemic starting materials that, upon ring opening facilitated by the catalytic generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, deliver an acyclic iminium ion/dienolate intermediate in which all stereochemical information has been deleted. The final cyclization step forms the rearrangement product, showing that chirality transfer from the catalyst to the final compound is highly effective and leads to the stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structurally different cyclopentenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molten Salts&#8208;Driven Discovery of a Polar Mixed&#8208;Anion 3D framework at the nanoscale: Zn4Si2O7Cl2, Charge Transport and Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;anion compounds widen the chemical space of attainable materials compared to single anionic compounds, but the exploration of their structural diversity is limited by common synthetic paths. Especially, oxychlorides rely mainly on layered structures, which suffer from low stability during photo(electro)catalytic processes. Herein we report a strategy to design a new polar 3D tetrahedral framework with composition Zn4Si2O7Cl2. We use a molten salt medium to enable low temperature crystallization of nanowires of this new compound, by relying on tetrahedral building units present in the melt to build the connectivity of the oxychloride. These units are combined with silicon&#8208;based connectors from a non&#8208;oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed&#8208;anion solids</dc:description>

These units are combined with silicon-based connectors from a non-oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed-anion solids&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Heterogeneous Nanowire Arrays for Efficient Overall Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are key to water electrolysis. Herein, we report built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) strategy to fabricate a heterogeneous nickel phosphide&#8208;cobalt nanowire arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP) with large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall splitting. Impressively, Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen reactions to obtain 10 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. Moreover, the fabricated lab&#8208;scale electrolyzer driven by an AAA battery delivers excellent stability after 50 h electrocatalysis with a 100% faradic efficiency. Computational calculations combining with experiments reveal the interface&#8208;induced electric field effect facilitates asymmetrical charge distributions, thereby regulating the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during reactions. This work offers an avenue to rationally design high&#8208;performance heterogeneous electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Antibody Recruiting by Metabolic Labeling with Caged Glycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose a de novo glycan display that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile editing method for cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting. The caging strategy prevents the capture of &#945;&#8208;rhamnose (an antigen glycan) by their endogenous antibodies during the introduction of the glycan to the targeted cell surface, and subsequent uncaging successfully induces immune responses. Therefore, this study proposes a practical method for editing the cell&#8208;surface glycocalyx under promiscuous conditions, such as those in vivo, which paves the way for the development of glycan function analysis and regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Copolymers Under Kinetic, Thermodynamic, or Pathway&#8208;Switching Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular copolymers have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities. However, the co&#8208;assembly strategies to construct co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules with well&#8208;defined sequence structures are still&#160;limited, especially for more complex crystalline block co&#8208;assemblies. Herein, we target this challenge by designing Ir(III) complexes 1 and 2, which possess unique self&#8208;assembly pathways and are capable of forming crystalline assemblies in aqueous systems. Specifically, block and random co&#8208;assemblies of 1 and 2 can be synthesized by kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. Meanwhile, by adjusting the water content to orthogonalize the on&#8208;pathway and the off&#8208;pathway, an unprecedented pathway&#8208;switching approach is realized to synthesize block and random co&#8208;assemblies. By coupling kinetic pathways, the present co&#8208;assembly strategies are expected to pave the way for the synthesis of crystalline co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules and the construction of organic heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cleavable Polymers via Oxidation of Thioether Moieties and Thiol Click Reactions: A Click&#8208;Declick Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decades click chemistries including thiol chemistries have found wide applications in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers. In this research, a click&#8208;declick strategy based on the oxidation of heteroaromatic thioethers and the substitution reactions between the oxidized groups and thiols, is proposed for the synthesis of the cleavable polymers. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, block copolymers (BCP) and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by thiol&#8208;phenylsulfone substitution reactions, and heteroaromatic thioethers are produced at the junction points of the BCP chains or on the crosslinking sites of the star&#8208;like polymer. The thioethers can be oxidized to heteroaromatic sulfoxides or sulfones, depending on the oxidization condition. It is demonstrated that both sulfoxides or sulfones can have base catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reactions with thiols, leading to the cleavage of the polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Ammonium Ion Intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation with Crystal Water Promotion Effect in Layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;metal NH4+ carrier has attracted tremendous interests for aqueous energy storage owing to its light molar mass and fast diffusion in aqueous electrolytes. Previous study inferred that NH4+ ion storage in layered VOPO4&#8729;2H2O is impossible due to the removal of NH4+ from NH4VOPO4 leads to a phase change inevitably. Herein, we update this cognition and demonstrated highly reversible intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation behavior of NH4+ in layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O host. Satisfactory specific capacity of 154.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4 V based on reference electrode was achieved in VOPO4&#183;2H2O. A rocking&#8208;chair ammonium&#8208;ion full cell with the VOPO4&#183;2H2O // 2.0 M NH4OTf // PTCDI configuration exhibited a specific capacity of 55 mAh g&#8208;1, an average operating voltage of about 1.0 V and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of ~99 %. Theoretical DFT calculations suggest a unique crystal water substitution process by ammonium ion during the intercalation process. Our results provide new insight into the intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of NH4+ ions in layered hydrated phosphates through crystal water enhancement effect.</dc:description>
