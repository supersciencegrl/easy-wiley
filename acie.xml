         <title>Three&#8208;component Self&#8208;Assembly Changes its Course: A Leap from Simple Polymers to 3D Networks of Spherical Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly reactions of the polyphosphorus complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (A), a coinage metal salt AgSbF6 and flexible aliphatic dinitriles NC(CH2)xCN (x&#160;=&#160;1&#160;&#8208;&#160;10) yield 1D, 2D and 3D coordination polymers. The seven&#8208;membered backbone of the dinitrile was experimentally found as the borderline for the self&#8208;assembly system furnishing products of different kinds. At x&#160;&lt;&#160;7, various rather simple polymers are exclusively formed possessing either 0D or 1D Ag/A structural motifs connected by dinitrile spacers, while at x &#8805; 7, the self&#8208;assembly switches to unprecedented extraordinary 3D networks of nano&#8208;sized host&#8208;guest assemblies (SbF6)@[(A)9Ag11]11+ (x&#160;=&#160;7) or (A)@[(A)12Ag12]12+ (x&#160;=&#160;8&#160;&#8211;&#160;10) linked by dinitriles. The polycationic nodes represent the first superspheres based on A and silver and are host&#8208;guest able. All products are characterized by NMR spectroscopy, MS spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The assemblies [(A)12Ag12]12+ were visualized by transmission electron microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Antitumor Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for biomedical applications owing to their unique properties. The porous structures make MOFs excellent candidates for the delivery of different drugs; the flexibility in choosing metal ions and organic ligands makes it feasible to prepare MOFs with intrinsic antitumor activities and further devise MOFs&#8208;drug synergistic systems; many other types of antitumor agents could also be developed using MOFs as the precursors/templates. Thus, the past two decades have witnessed the great development of MOFs&#8208;based drugs, especially in the antitumor fields. This minireview mainly focuses on the design and applications of MOFs&#8208;based antitumor agents. Four aspects covering the whole field are introduced: MOFs as carriers, MOFs as antitumor agents, MOFs&#8208;drug synergistic systems, and MOFs&#8208;derived antitumor agents. The challenges and opportunities of MOFs for clinical antitumor applications are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency induced by interface engineering enables  rapid, stable sodium storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High initial coulombic efficiency is highly desired because it implies effective interface construction and few electrolyte consumption, indicating enhanced batteries&#8217; life and power output. In this work, a high&#8208;capacity sodium storage material with FeS  2  nanoclusters (~1&#8208;2 nm) embedded in N, S&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeS  2  /N,S&#8208;C) was synthesized, the surface of which displays defects&#8208;repaired characteristic and detectable dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds. After the initial discharging process, the uniform ultra&#8208;thin NaF&#8208;rich (6.0 nm) solid electrolyte interphase was obtained, thereby achieving verifiable ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency (~92%). The defects&#8208;repaired surface provides perfect platform, and the catalysis of dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds to the rapid decomposing of NaSO  3  CF  3  and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether successfully accelerate the building of two&#8208;dimensional ultra&#8208;thin solid electrolyte interphase. DFT calculations further confirmed the catalysis mechanism. As a result, the constructed FeS  2  /N,S&#8208;C provides high reversible capacity (749.6 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8722;1  ) and outstanding cycle stability (92.7%, 10000 cycles, 10.0 A g  &#8722;1  ). Especially, at &#8722;15 &#176;C, it also obtains a reversible capacity of 211.7 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 10.0 A g  &#8722;1  . Assembled pouch&#8208;type cell performs potential application. The insight in this work provides a bright way to interface design for performance improvement in batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Anticancer Nanoprodrugs Featuring Self&#8208;toxification Activity Realized by Acid&#8208;triggered Biodegradation and in situ Fragments Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs that allow in situ chemical conversion of less toxic precursors into active drugs in response to certain stimuli are promising anticancer candidates. Herein, we present a novel design of nanoprodrugs with a &#8220;degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification&#8221; strategy, which realizes intracellular synthesis of anticancer agents using nanoparticles&#8217; own degradation fragments as the precursors. To fulfill this concept, a metal complexing dicyclohexylphosphine (DCP) organosilane is carefully screened out from various ligands to conjugate onto Pd(OH)  2  nanodots confined hollow silica nanospheres (PD&#8208;HSN). This constructed nanoprodrug shows acid&#8208;triggered degradation in lysosomes and neutralize protons to induce lysosomes rupturing, generating predesigned less toxic fragments (Pd  2+  and DCP&#8208;silicates) that complex into DCP/Pd complex in situ for inducing DNA damage, leading to enhanced anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft tumour model.</dc:description>

         <title>A Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Borosulfate with Incommensurate Modulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite borate&#8208;sulfates composed of isolated borate and sulfate groups have been discovered for more than one century, borosulfates of B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding have not been synthesized until 2012 and their properties remain rarely explored. Here, we report a new borosulfate, namely LiRb4[B(SO4)4], which shows potential as a bran&#8208;new class of deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Remarkably, according to the  in&#8208;situ  single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, &#160;LiRb4[B(SO4)4] undergoes successive first&#8208;order phase transitions with incommensurate structural modulations under room temperature and low temperature with (3 + 1)D superspace groups of  X2(&#945;0&#947;)0 and  P21(&#945;0&#947;)0, respectively. The first&#8208;principle calculations and structural analyses reveal that NLO properties, phase transitions, and incommensurate modulations are closely related to the [B(SO4)4]5&#8208;&#160;  super&#8208;tetrahedral units with B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding. We anticipate that the unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, NLO responses, and incommensurate structural modulations in one borosulfate will bring new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Mapping of Phospholipid Ferroptotic Death Signals in Cells and Tissues by Gas Cluster Ion Beam Secondary Ion Mass Spec&#8208;trometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) species have been identified by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) as predictive biomarkers of ferroptosis, a new program of regulated cell death. However, the presence and subcellular distribution of PEox in specific cell types and tissues have not been directly detected by imaging protocols. By applying Gas Cluster Ion Beam Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS) imaging with a 70 keV (H  2  O)  n  +  (n&gt;28,000) cluster ion beam, we were able to map PEox with 1.2 micron spatial resolution at the single cell/subcellular level in ferroptotic H9c2 cardiomyocytes and cortical/hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury. Application of this protocol affords visualization of physiologically relevant levels of very low abundance (20 pmol/&#956;mol lipid) peroxidized lipids in subcellular compartments and their accumulation in disease conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutralizing aptamers block S/RBD&#8208;ACE2 interactions and prevent host cell infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike (S) protein plays a central role in mediating the first step of virus infection to cause disease: virus binding to angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on human host cells. Therefore, S/RBD is an ideal target for blocking and neutralization therapies to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19). Using a target&#8208;based selection approach, we developed  oligonucleotide aptamers  containing a conserved sequence motif that specifically targets S/RBD. Synthetic aptamers had high binding affinity for S/RBD&#8208;coated virus mimics (K  D  ~7 nM) and also blocked interaction of S/RBD with ACE2 receptors (IC  50  ~5 nM). Importantly, aptamers were able to neutralize S protein&#8208;expressing viral particles and prevent host cell infection, suggesting a promising COVID&#8208;19 therapy strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved and Comprehensive Analysis of Surface Glycoproteins Reveals Distinct Responses of Monocytes and Macrophages to Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoproteins on the surface of immune cells play extremely important roles in response to pathogens. Yet, a systematic and time&#8208;resolved investigation of surface glycoproteins in the immune response process remains to be explored. Integrating selective enrichment of surface glycoproteins with multiplexed proteomics, we globally and site&#8208;specifically quantified the dynamics of cell&#8208;surface glycoproteins on THP&#8208;1 monocytes and macrophages in response to bacterial infection and during the monocyte&#8208;to&#8208;macrophage differentiation. The time&#8208;resolved analysis reveals transient changes and differential remodeling of surface glycoproteins on both cell types, as well as potential upstream regulators and downstream effects of the regulated glycoproteins. Besides, we identified novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response such as APMAP. Furthermore, site&#8208;specific changes of surface glycoproteins were identified in response to the lipopolysaccharides challenge. This study provides unprecedented and valuable information to facilitate a better understanding of glycoprotein functions and cellular immune responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for Pore Blockade of the Human Cardiac Sodium Channel Nav1.5 by the Antiarrhythmic Drug Quinidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na  v  1.5, the primary voltage&#8208;gated Na  +  (Na  v  ) channel in heart, is a major target for class I antiarrhythmic agents. Here we present the cryo&#8208;EM structure of full&#8208;length human Na  v  1.5 bound to quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, at 3.3 &#197; resolution. Quinidine is positioned right beneath the selectivity filter in the pore domain and coordinated by residues from repeats I, III, and IV. Pore blockade by quinidine is achieved through both direct obstruction of the ion permeation path and induced rotation of an invariant Tyr residue that tightens the intracellular gate. Structural comparison with a truncated rat Na  v  1.5 in the presence of flecainide, a class Ic agent, reveals distinct binding poses for the two antiarrhythmics within the pore domain. Our work reported here, along with previous studies, reveals the molecular basis for the mechanism of action of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetization transfer to enhance NOE cross&#8208;peaks among labile protons: Applications to imino&#8208;imino sequential walks in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;derived RNAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D NOESY plays a central role in structural NMR. We have recently discussed methods that rely on solvent&#8208;driven exchanges, to enhance NOE correlations between exchangeable and non&#8208;exchangeable protons in nucleic acids. Such methods, however, fail when trying to establish connectivities within pools of labile protons. This study introduces an alternative that also enhances NOEs between such labile sites, based on encoding a priori selected peaks by selective saturations. The resulting selective magnetization transfer (SMT) experiment proves particularly useful for enhancing the imino&#8208;imino cross&#8208;peaks in RNAs, which is a first step in the NMR resolution of these structures. The origins of these enhancements are discussed, and their potential demonstrated on RNA fragments derived from the genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, recorded with better sensitivity and an order of magnitude faster than conventional 2D counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike binding DNA aptamer that inhibits pseudovirus infection by an RBD independent mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (CoV2&#8208;S) binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2&#8208;S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2&#8208;S and does not block the interaction of CoV2&#8208;S with ACE2. Notwithstanding, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS&#8208;CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Residual Chlorine Induced Cationic Active Species on Porous Cu Electrocatalyst for Highly Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) is an attractive approach to deal with the excessive emission of CO  2  and to produce valuable fuels and chemicals in a carbon&#8208;neutral way. Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high&#8208;value multicarbon products (C  2+  ) on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, Cu&#8208;based CO  2  RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO  2  RR condition. To date, most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts present stabilities over dozens of hours, which limits the advance of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR. Here, a porous chlorine&#8208;doped Cu electrocatalyst is reported and exhibits high C  2+  Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 53.8% at &#8208;1.00 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (V  RHE  ). Importantly, the catalyst exhibited an outstanding catalytic stability in long&#8208;term electrocatalysis over 240 hours. Experimental results show that the chlorine&#8208;induced stable cationic Cu  0  &#8208;Cu  +  species and the well&#8208;preserved structure with abundant active sites are found to be critical to maintain the high FE of C  2+  in the long&#8208;term run of electrochemical CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Drop&#8208;casting enables making efficient perovskite solar cells under high humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drop&#8208;casting was used to make MAPbI  3  films for solar cells. The crystal growth in drop&#8208;cast  MAPbI  3  f  ilms was  regulated by  adjusting temperature. A mechanism for the formation of different morphology was proposed by combining  in&#8208;situ  crystal&#8208;growth study with XRD measurements. The crystals in the films made  at low temperature (60  &#176;C)  and high temperature (&#8805;120 &#176;C) are (110) and (200) oriented, respectively. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity. MAPbI  3  solar cells made under 88% humidity delivered a PCE of 18.17%, which is the highest PCE for perovskite solar cells made under &gt;70% humidity without antisolvent &#160;assistance.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Remote Activation of Ferroptosis in Target Tumor Cells through a Photothermally Responsive Iron&#8208;Chelated Biopolymer Nanoplatform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death and holds promise for tumor inhibition. However, it is difficult to remotely control the initiation and execution of ferroptosis in specific sites. This study reports a biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymeric nanoplatform for tumor&#8208;targeted ferroptosis therapy, of which the pro&#8208;ferroptotic activities could be activated in an on&#8208;demand manner using near&#8208;infrared light as the triggering signal.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death that shows promise for tumor treatment. Most current ferroptosis tumor therapies are based on the intrinsic pathological features of the malignancies, and it would be of clinical significance to develop ferroptosis&#8208;inducing strategies with improved tumor specificity and modulability. Here we report a polydopamine&#8208;based nanoplatform (FeIIPDA@LAP&#8208;PEG&#8208;cRGD) for the efficient loading of Fe2+ and &#946;&#8208;lapachone (LAP), which could readily initiate ferroptosis in tumor cells upon treatment with near&#8208;infrared light. PDA nanostructures could generate mild hyperthermia under NIR irritation and trigger the release of the ferroptosis&#8208;inducing Fe2+ ions. The NIR&#8208;actuated photothermal effect would also activate cellular heat shock response and upregulate the downstream NQO1 via HSP70/NQO1 axis to facilitate bioreduction of the concurrently released &#946;&#8208;lapachone and enhance intracellular H2O2 formation to promote the Fe2+&#8208;mediated lipid peroxidation.

         <title>Traceless Removal of Two Kernel Atoms in a Gold Nanocluster and Its Impact on Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel nanoclusters Au48(m&#8208;MB)26 and Au46(m&#8208;MBT)26 have been synthesized and fully characterized, and the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in metal nanoclusters has been achieved for the first time. The two kernel atoms reduction leads to the photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) increase by almost four times. In addition, kernel bond length dependent photoluminescence and kernel charge state were first revealed.







Abstract
Removing or adding kernel atoms of metal nanoclusters (NCs) without leaving a trace is a substantial challenge because the kernel atoms are inside and covered by the outer staples. However, such kernel tuning is very important for improving the properties and acquiring an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kernel&#8208;property correlation. Photoluminescence (PL) is one of the most intriguing characteristics of metal NCs but has not been well understood until now. Inspired by these challenges/questions, we conducted this study and, for the first time, achieved the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in a gold nanocluster by applying a simple thermal treatment and revealed its impact on PL. Further, we demonstrated that the kernel Au&#8208;Au bond length can be an indicator for a comparison of the PL or kernel charge state between nanoclusters with similar kernel structures and sizes.

         <title>Structural Revision of Natural Cyclic Depsipeptide MA026 Established by Total Synthesis and Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revised structure of natural cyclic depsipeptide MA026 with tight junction opening activity was established by physicochemical analysis and confirmed by its total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrated that the stereochemistry of amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained.







Abstract
A revised structure of natural 14&#8208;mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from Pseudomonas sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS, and NMR and confirmed by total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, assigned in error, have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity like that of the natural one in a cell&#8208;based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (ca. 90&#8201;%) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin&#8208;1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.

         <title>Unveiling the Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Donating Character of MoS2 in Covalently Linked Hybrids Featuring Perylenediimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known electron acceptor perylenediimide (PDI) is covalently attached to semiconducting MoS2, thus exposing the MoS2 material's electron donating potential in the novel MoS2&#8211;PDI hybrid.







Abstract
The covalent functionalization of MoS2 with a perylenediimide (PDI) is reported and the study is accompanied by detailed characterization of the newly prepared MoS2&#8208;PDI hybrid material. Covalently functionalized MoS2 interfacing organic photoactive species has shown electron and/or energy accepting, energy reflecting or bi&#8208;directional electron accepting features. Herein, a rationally designed PDI, unsubstituted at the perylene core to act as electron acceptor, forces MoS2 to fully demonstrate for the first time its electron donor capabilities. The photophysical response of MoS2&#8208;PDI is visualized in an energy&#8208;level diagram, while femtosecond transient absorption studies disclose the formation of MoS2.+&#8208;PDI.&#8722; charge separated state. The tunable electronic properties of MoS2, as a result of covalently linking photoactive organic species with precise characteristics, unlock their potentiality and enable their application in light&#8208;harvesting and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Enzymatic Late&#8208;Stage Modifications: Better Late Than Never</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage modification is an indispensable approach for compound diversification in synthesis. Since enzymes offer particularly powerful means for mild, catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalisations, in recent years several novel biocatalytic methods have emerged enabling a broad array of orthogonal reactions. Herein, the wide range of late&#8208;stage biotransformations is reviewed and various enzyme classes along with topical examples are discussed.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis is gaining increasing importance in synthetic chemistry. Nowadays, the growing number of biocatalysts accessible by means of bioinformatics and enzyme engineering opens up an immense variety of selective reactions.

     alt="Enzymatic Late&#8208;Stage Modifications: Better Late Than Never"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late&#8208;stage modification is an indispensable approach for compound diversification in synthesis. Since enzymes offer particularly powerful means for mild, catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalisations, in recent years several novel biocatalytic methods have emerged enabling a broad array of orthogonal reactions. Herein, the wide range of late&#8208;stage biotransformations is reviewed and various enzyme classes along with topical examples are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzyme catalysis is gaining increasing importance in synthetic chemistry. Nowadays, the growing number of biocatalysts accessible by means of bioinformatics and enzyme engineering opens up an immense variety of selective reactions. Biocatalysis especially provides excellent opportunities for late&#8208;stage modification often superior to conventional de&#8197;novo synthesis. Enzymes have proven to be useful for direct introduction of functional groups into complex scaffolds, as well as for rapid diversification of compound libraries. Particularly important and highly topical are enzyme&#8208;catalysed oxyfunctionalisations, halogenations, methylations, reductions, and amide bond formations due to the high prevalence of these motifs in pharmaceuticals. This Review gives an overview of the strengths and limitations of enzymatic late&#8208;stage modifications using native and engineered enzymes in synthesis while focusing on important examples in drug development.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydrosilylation/Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with secondary and tertiary hydrosilanes with a catalyst generated in situ from the combination of Co(acac)  2  and (  R  ,  S  p  )&#8208;Josiphos. Under identified conditions, a wide range of oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and carbon&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes reacted with Ph  2  SiH  2  , (EtO)  3  SiH, or (RO)  2  MeSiH to afford the corresponding chiral organosilane products in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). In addition, this cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization also occurred with prochiral secondary hydrosilane PhMeSiH  2  to yield chiral alkylsilanes containing both carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity, albeit with modest diastereoselectivity. The chiral organosilane products from this cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation/cyclization could be converted to a variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds by stereospecific conversion of their C&#8208;Si and Si&#8208;H bonds without loss of enantiopurity. Mechanistic studies including deuterium&#8208;labeling, control, and competition experiments suggest a chiral cobalt hydride intermediate [(  L*  )Co&#8208;H], the chelation of 1,6&#8208;enynes to cobalt catalysts, and the regioselectivity controlled by the relative reactivity of the alkyne and alkene moieties toward hydrocobaltation.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Membrane Protein Association Using Concentration&#8208;Dependent Number and Brightness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6503-6508, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B) is a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. cdN&amp;B uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant.







Abstract
We introduce concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and can report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. It uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant. We discuss artifacts in cdN&amp;B that are concentration&#8208;dependent and can distort the oligomerization curves, and we outline procedures that can correct for them. Using cdN&amp;B, we characterize the association of neuropilin&#8197;1 (NRP1), a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the embryonic cardiovascular and nervous systems. We show that NRP1 associates into a tetramer in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and we quantify the strength of the association. This work demonstrates the utility of cdN&amp;B as a powerful tool in biophysical chemistry.

         <title>A Pseudotetrahedral Terminal Oxoiron(IV) Complex: Mechanistic Promiscuity in C&#8722;H Bond Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6752-6756, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reactive S=2 pseudotetrahedral oxoiron(IV) complex 2 supported by a sterically demanding 1,4,7&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane ligand has been synthesized and spectroscopically characterized as one of the best electronic and functional models for a biological oxoiron(IV) intermediate of taurine dioxygenase (TauD&#8208;J).







Abstract
S=2 oxoiron(IV) species act as reactive intermediates in the catalytic cycle of nonheme iron oxygenases. The few available synthetic S=2 FeIV=O complexes known to date are often limited to trigonal bipyramidal and very rarely to octahedral geometries. Herein we describe the generation and characterization of an S=2 pseudotetrahedral FeIV=O complex 2 supported by the sterically demanding 1,4,7&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane ligand. Complex 2 is a very potent oxidant in hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactions with large non&#8208;classical deuterium kinetic isotope effects, suggesting hydrogen tunneling contributions. For sterically encumbered substrates, direct HAA is impeded and an alternative oxidative asynchronous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism prevails, which is unique within the nonheme oxoiron community. The high reactivity and the similar spectroscopic parameters make 2 one of the best electronic and functional models for a biological oxoiron(IV) intermediate of taurine dioxygenase (TauD&#8208;J).

         <title>A Highly Ordered Quantum Dot Supramolecular Assembly Exhibiting Photoinduced Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6473-6479, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly ordered coaggregates of quantum dots (QDs) with inter&#8208;QD interaction can be created by using the self&#8208;assembled azobenzene derivatives. Furthermore, the inter&#8208;QD interaction can be reversibly controlled by photoirradiation and time&#8208;aging.







Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular assembly systems enable the generation of materials with outstanding properties, not obtained from single&#8208;component systems, via a synergetic effect. Herein, we demonstrate a novel supramolecular coassembly system rendering highly ordered quantum dot (QD) arrangement structures formed via the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene derivatives, where the photocontrollable photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs are realized based on photoisomerization. Upon mixing the assembled azobenzene derivatives and QDs in apolar media, a time&#8208;evolution coaggregation into hierarchical nanosheets with a highly ordered QD arrangement structure occurs. Upon photoirradiation, the nanosheets transform into ill&#8208;defined aggregates without arranged QDs together with enhancing the PL intensity. In days, the photoirradiated coaggregates undergo recovery of the PL properties corresponding to the arranged QDs through thermal isomerization.

Upon photoirradiation, the nanosheets transform into ill&#8208;defined aggregates without arranged QDs together with enhancing the PL intensity. In days, the photoirradiated coaggregates undergo recovery of the PL properties corresponding to the arranged QDs through thermal isomerization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Histone H4 Tails in Nucleosomes: a Fuzzy Interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6480-6487, March 15, 2021. </description>

15N relaxation data suggest that amino&#8208;terminal histone H4 tails in reconstituted nucleosome are flexible. This result is rationalized by suitably designed MD simulations, showing that H4 tails are involved in a fuzzy interaction with nucleosomal DNA while retaining their disordered character.







Abstract
The interaction of positively charged N&#8208;terminal histone tails with nucleosomal DNA plays an important role in chromatin assembly and regulation, modulating their susceptibility to post&#8208;translational modifications and recognition by chromatin&#8208;binding proteins. Here, we report residue&#8208;specific 15N NMR relaxation rates for histone H4 tails in reconstituted nucleosomes. These data indicate that H4 tails are strongly dynamically disordered, albeit with reduced conformational flexibility compared to a free peptide with the same sequence. Remarkably, the NMR observables were successfully reproduced in a 2&#8208;&#956;s MD trajectory of the nucleosome. This is an important step toward resolving an apparent inconsistency where prior simulations were generally at odds with experimental evidence on conformational dynamics of histone tails. Our findings indicate that histone H4 tails engage in a fuzzy interaction with nucleosomal DNA, underpinned by a variable pattern of short&#8208;lived salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which persists at low ionic strength (0&#8211;100&#8197;mM NaCl).

         <dc:description>
The dual catalytic role of 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) was revealed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones under a metal&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;free method. By means of a double&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer process, TBD activates the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, avoiding the necessity of an alkali metal. Most importantly, TBD enhances the activity of the peroxide intermediate through the double hydrogen bonds, allowing reduction by DMSO in the absence of a phosphine reductant.







Abstract
The critical role of double hydrogen bonds was addressed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones catalyzed by 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD), in the absence of either a metal catalyst or phosphine reductant. Experimental and theoretical investigations were performed to study the mechanism. In addition to initiating the reaction by proton abstraction, a more important role of TBD was revealed, that is, to enhance the oxidizing ability of peroxide intermediates, allowing DMSO to be used rather than commonly used phosphine reductants. Further characterizations with nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) confirmed the presence of double hydrogen bonds between TBD and the ketone, and kinetic studies suggested the attack of dioxygen on the TBD&#8208;enol adduct to be the rate&#8208;determining step. This work should encourage the application of TBD as a catalyst for oxidations.

A facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes with high surface distortion has been developed. This electrocatalyst showed superior activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction in a fuel cell.







Abstract
Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction is important for the long&#8208;term operation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Reported herein is a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes (NMs) that are composed of highly distorted Pt networks (neck width of 2.05&#177;0.72&#8197;nm) and carbon. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated the metallic state of Pt in the coplanar Pt/C NMs. Fuel cell tests verified the excellent activity of the coplanar Pt/C NM catalyst with the peak power density of 1.21&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and current density of 0.360&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.80&#8197;V in the H2/O2 cell. Moreover, the coplanar Pt/C NM electrocatalysts showed superior stability against aggregation, with NM structures preserved intact for a long&#8208;term operation of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles for electrode measurement, and the working voltage loss was negligible after 120&#8197;h in the H2/O2 single cell operation. Density&#8208;functional theory analysis indicates the increased vacancy formation energy of Pt atoms for coplanar Pt/C NMs, restraining the tendency of Pt dissolution and aggregation.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Measurement of Osmotic Pressures by FRET Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6488-6495, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel osmotic pressure sensor based on liposomes loaded with FRET dyes is developed, which experience volume changes responding to osmotic pressure due to water outflux through their semipermeable membrane. With FRET microscopy, measurement of osmotic pressures in situ with spatiotemporal resolution is demonstrated, which has not been achieved so far.







Abstract
Osmotic pressures (OPs) play essential roles in biological processes and numerous technological applications. However, the measurement of OP in situ with spatiotemporal resolution has not been achieved so far. Herein, we introduce a novel kind of OP sensor based on liposomes loaded with water&#8208;soluble fluorescent dyes exhibiting resonance energy transfer (FRET). The liposomes experience volume changes in response to OP due to water outflux. The FRET efficiency depends on the average distance between the entrapped dyes and thus provides a direct measure of the OP surrounding each liposome. The sensors exhibit high sensitivity to OP in the biologically relevant range of 0&#8211;0.3&#8197;MPa in aqueous solutions of salt, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. With the help of FRET microscopy, we demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal OP imaging, which can be a promising new tool to investigate phenomena involving OPs and their dynamics in biology and technology.

         <title>Coupling of Reformatsky Reagents with Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6778-6783, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines were tailored to fit the requirements of room&#8208;temperature Negishi couplings of aryl chlorides. YPhos/Pd catalyst is highly efficient for the coupling with aryl chlorides in general, and the reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility. This allows the selective coupling of aryl electrophiles in the competitive reaction as demonstrated in the synthesis of ibuprofen.







Abstract
The coupling of aryl chlorides with Reformatsky reagents is a desirable strategy for the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl esters but has so far been substantially limited in the substrate scope due to many challenges posed by various possible side reactions. This limitation has now been overcome by the tailoring of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines to fit the requirements of Negishi couplings. Record&#8208;setting activities were achieved in palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylations of organozinc reagents with aryl electrophiles using a cyclohexyl&#8208;YPhos ligand bearing an ortho&#8208;tolyl&#8208;substituent in the backbone. This highly electron&#8208;rich, bulky ligand enables the use of aryl chlorides in room temperature couplings of Reformatsky reagents. The reaction scope covers diversely functionalized arylacetic and arylpropionic acid derivatives. Aryl bromides and chlorides can be converted selectively over triflate electrophiles, which permits consecutive coupling strategies.

     alt="Coupling of Reformatsky Reagents with Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphine Ligands"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines were tailored to fit the requirements of room&#8208;temperature Negishi couplings of aryl chlorides. YPhos/Pd catalyst is highly efficient for the coupling with aryl chlorides in general, and the reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility. This allows the selective coupling of aryl electrophiles in the competitive reaction as demonstrated in the synthesis of ibuprofen.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coupling of aryl chlorides with Reformatsky reagents is a desirable strategy for the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl esters but has so far been substantially limited in the substrate scope due to many challenges posed by various possible side reactions. This limitation has now been overcome by the tailoring of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines to fit the requirements of Negishi couplings. Record&#8208;setting activities were achieved in palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylations of organozinc reagents with aryl electrophiles using a cyclohexyl&#8208;YPhos ligand bearing an ortho&#8208;tolyl&#8208;substituent in the backbone. This highly electron&#8208;rich, bulky ligand enables the use of aryl chlorides in room temperature couplings of Reformatsky reagents. The reaction scope covers diversely functionalized arylacetic and arylpropionic acid derivatives. Aryl bromides and chlorides can be converted selectively over triflate electrophiles, which permits consecutive coupling strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Ligand Selection Strategy Identifies Chemical Probes Targeting the Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6799-6806, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the ligand space allows to rapidly customize chemical probes for efficacy and active site specificity for a protease of interest. The application of this ligand selection approach is exemplified by generating probes for the two non&#8208;homologous yet essential proteases of the new corona virus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 providing complementary chemical tools for proteomic labeling and inhibitor discovery.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes are valuable tools for chemical biology. However, finding probes that specifically target the active site of an enzyme remains a challenging task. Herein, we present a ligand selection strategy that allows to rapidly tailor electrophilic probes to a target of choice and showcase its application for the two cysteine proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as proof of concept. The resulting probes were specific for the active site labeling of 3CLpro and PLpro with sufficient selectivity in a live cell model as well as in the background of a native human proteome. Exploiting the probes as tools for competitive profiling of a natural product library identified salvianolic acid derivatives as promising 3CLpro inhibitors. We anticipate that our ligand selection strategy will be useful to rapidly develop customized probes and discover inhibitors for a wide range of target proteins also beyond corona virus proteases.

         <title>Scan and Unlock: A Programmable DNA Molecular Automaton for Cell&#8208;Selective Activation of Ligand&#8208;Based Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6733-6743, March 15, 2021. </description>

An intelligent molecular&#8208;lock device of signaling ligand proteins, termed &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA), is presented. The SUDA employs DNA chemical reaction networks to autonomously scan and logically evaluate the cell&#8208;surface&#8208;protein profile of the designated cell type, selectively unlocking the signaling ligand&#8211;receptor interactions for cell&#8208;specific signaling.







Abstract
Selective modulation of ligand&#8211;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. In this study, we design an intelligent &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking the protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof of concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling.

         <title>Adaptive Chirality of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework for Chirality Induction in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6744-6751, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral supramolecular organic framework (SOF) exhibits adaptive chirality with dual circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence responses when meeting various chiral guests, including L&#8208;/D&#8208;Phe, adenosine derivatives, and peptides/proteins via chirality induction in water. The adaptive chirality of the SOF can be used as a chiroptical platform to determine the enantiopurity, develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish peptides/proteins.







Abstract
Chiral framework materials have been developed for many applications including chiral recognition, chiral separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical materials. Herein, we report that an achiral cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (SOF&#8208;1) with the dynamic rotational conformation of tetraphenylethene units can exhibit adaptive chirality to produce M&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 or P&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 with mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism (CD) with gabs&#8776;&#177;10&#8722;4 and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with glum&#8776;&#177;10&#8722;4 induced by L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine in water, respectively. The chirality induction in CD (gabs&#8776;&#8722;10&#8722;4) and CPL (glum&#8776;&#8722;10&#8722;4) of P&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 from achiral SOF&#8208;1 can be presented by using a small amount of adenosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate disodium (ATP) or adenosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;diphosphate disodium (ADP) (only 0.4&#8197;equiv) in water. Furthermore, the adaptive chirality of SOF&#8208;1 can be used to determine dipeptide sequences (e.g., Phe&#8208;Ala and Ala&#8208;Phe) and distinguish polypeptides/proteins (e.g., somatostatin and human insulin) with characteristic CD spectra. Therefore, achiral SOF&#8208;1 as an ideal chiroptical platform with adaptive chirality may be applied to determine the enantiopurity of amino acids (e.g., L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine), develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish biological chiral macromolecules (e.g., peptides/proteins) via chirality induction in water.

         <title>Leveraging Free Volume Manipulation to Improve the Membrane Separation Performance of Amine&#8208;Functionalized PIM&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6593-6599, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protection/deprotection strategy was developed to enhance the separation performance of amine&#8208;functionalized PIM&#8208;1. Thermal deprotection yielded a synergistic boost in size&#8208;sieving and CO2 diffusion, ultimately surpassing the H2/CH4, O2/N2 and H2/N2 upper bounds and boosting CO2 permeability by 200&#8201;%.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;separation polymer membranes display a characteristic permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off that has limited their industrial use. The most comprehensive approach to improving performance is to devise strategies that simultaneously increase fractional free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and enhance sorption selectivity, but generalizable methods for such approaches are exceedingly rare. Here, we present an in&#8197;situ crosslinking and solid&#8208;state deprotection method to access previously inaccessible sorption and diffusion characteristics in amine&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity. Free volume element (FVE) size can be increased while preserving a narrow FVE distribution, enabling below&#8208;upper bound polymers to surpass the H2/N2, H2/CH4, and O2/N2 upper bounds and improving CO2&#8208;based selectivities by 200&#8201;%. This approach can transform polymers into chemical analogues with improved performance, thereby overcoming traditional permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;offs.

&lt;p&gt;Gas&#8208;separation polymer membranes display a characteristic permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off that has limited their industrial use. The most comprehensive approach to improving performance is to devise strategies that simultaneously increase fractional free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and enhance sorption selectivity, but generalizable methods for such approaches are exceedingly rare. Here, we present an in&#8197;situ crosslinking and solid&#8208;state deprotection method to access previously inaccessible sorption and diffusion characteristics in amine&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity. Free volume element (FVE) size can be increased while preserving a narrow FVE distribution, enabling below&#8208;upper bound polymers to surpass the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upper bounds and improving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based selectivities by 200&#8201;%. This approach can transform polymers into chemical analogues with improved performance, thereby overcoming traditional permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;offs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Separation of Acetylene and Carbon Dioxide in a Decorated Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6526-6532, March 15, 2021. </description>

A decorated zeolite material, Cu@FAU, exhibits highly selective adsorption of acetylene and thus efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide, unlocking the potential of zeolite materials in challenging industrial separations.







Abstract
The almost identical molecular sizes and volatilities of acetylene and carbon dioxide make their separation extremely challenging in industry. Reported here is the efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide (v/v=2/1, which is relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream) in faujasite zeolites decorated with atomically&#8208;dispersed copper(II) sites under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering confirm that the confined copper(II) site displays chemoselective yet reversible binding to acetylene, whereas adsorbed carbon dioxide molecules are stabilized by weak host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions with the framework oxygen centers, thus resulting in the efficient separation of these two gases under flow conditions. A designed adsorption&#8208;purging&#8208;desorption system based upon Cu@FAU is established for the recovery of high purity acetylene (98&#8211;99&#8201;%) from the mixture of acetylene and carbon dioxide, offering an unprecedented separation factor of 22.2 with an effective dynamic uptake of acetylene of 1.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K.

A P/B&#8208;H frustrated Lewis pair is formed by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. It reacts in an unusual way with a variety of organic &#960;&#8208;systems by addition/rearrangement routes.







Abstract
The Mes2P&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;SiMe3 alkyne reacts with the borane H2B&#8208;Fmes by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction to give an unsaturated C2&#8208;bridged frustrated P/B&#8208;H Lewis pair. Most of its reactions are determined by the presence of the B&#8208;H functionality at the FLP function and the activated connecting carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. It reduces carbon monoxide to the formyl stage. With nitriles it reacts in an extraordinary way: it undergoes a reaction sequence that eventually results in the formation of a P&#8208;substituted dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborole derivative. Several similar examples were found. In one case a P&#8208;ylide was isolated that was related to an intermediate of the reaction sequence. It subsequently opened in an alternative way to give an alkenyl borane product.

         <title>Unveiling the Hydration Structure of Ferrihydrite for Hole Storage in Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6691-6698, March 15, 2021. </description>

The [FeO6] polyhedral hydration structure of ferrihydrite is responsible for its hole storage function. With the continuous loss of three molecules of crystal water, the quantity of stored photogenerated holes for PEC water oxidation gradually decreases, accompanied by the destruction of the hydration structure.







Abstract
Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated acting as a hole&#8208;storage layer (HSL) in photoelectrocatalysis system. However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. The irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO6] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO6] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Sponge Lipid Nanocarrier for in Situ Cargo Loading and Release Using Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6573-6580, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drug&#8208;sponge nanocarrier that reversibly captures and releases drugs or contrast agents under pH control is developed using dynamic covalent chemistry. Inside this lipid droplet nano&#8208;reactor, lipophilic capture molecules transform free cargo&#8208;ketones into encapsulated hydrazone prodrugs, enabling the controlled release of active cargos and also their extraction from cells and tissues for detoxification.







Abstract
Currently, drug&#8208;delivery strategies using nanocarriers (NCs) deal with encapsulation of cargo or its covalently modified prodrug. Herein, we propose a concept of reversible pH&#8208;controlled capture and delivery of active cargo based on dynamic covalent chemistry inside lipid nano&#8208;droplets (nanoemulsions), coined as &#8220;drug sponge&#8221;. We designed a highly lipophilic hydrazide (LipoHD) capable of reacting with a free cargo&#8208;ketone (fluorescent dye and doxorubicin drug) directly inside lipid NCs, yielding a lipophilic hydrazone prodrug efficiently captured in the oil core. LipoHD&#8208;loaded NCs spontaneously accumulated cargo&#8208;ketones, yielding formulations stable against cargo leakage at pH&#8197;7.4, and further released their dye/drug cargo at low pH range (5.0&#8211;6.8) in solution and live cells. Doxorubicin&#8208;loaded drug&#8208;sponge NCs showed cytotoxicity in four cancer cell lines and capacity to inhibit tumor growth in subcutaneous xenografts of mice. Finally, unprecedented extraction of dye/drug cargos directly from cells and tissues (i.e. detoxification) was realized by the drug&#8208;sponge NCs.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Planarized Triphenylamine&#8208;Based Linear Mixed&#8208;Valence Charge&#8208;Transfer Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6771-6777, March 15, 2021. </description>

Novel building blocks for mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer compounds: Planar N&#8208;heterotriangulene dimers with low reorganization energies and activation barriers for electron self&#8208;exchange have been synthesized and characterized.







Abstract
Three linear dimers with two redox&#8208;active planarized triphenylamines were synthesized and their structures verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their radical cations, which exhibit electron self&#8208;exchange between the two redox centers, are of great interest. This process was thoroughly investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, and (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations. A comparison of the key parameters of electron transfer with non&#8208;planarized nitrogen&#8208;centered building blocks emphasizes the impact of using redox centers with low internal reorganization energies.

&lt;p&gt;Novel building blocks for mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer compounds: Planar &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterotriangulene dimers with low reorganization energies and activation barriers for electron self&#8208;exchange have been synthesized and characterized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three linear dimers with two redox&#8208;active planarized triphenylamines were synthesized and their structures verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their radical cations, which exhibit electron self&#8208;exchange between the two redox centers, are of great interest. This process was thoroughly investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, and (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations. A comparison of the key parameters of electron transfer with non&#8208;planarized nitrogen&#8208;centered building blocks emphasizes the impact of using redox centers with low internal reorganization energies. However, the distance&#8208;dependence attenuation factor of the super&#8208;exchange mechanisms remains similar.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols by Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkoxyallenes with Aldimine Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6545-6552, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal catalysis was established for the asymmetric coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. This method resulted in the diastereodivergent synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs. The total synthesis of mycestericins F and G was demonstrated.







Abstract
Both syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols are common structural motifs in natural products, drug molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts. However, the currently available methods for synthesizing these motifs are limited to generate only one diastereoisomer. Therefore, development of a unified method for stereoselective access to complementary diastereomers would be highly desirable. Herein, we report a method for dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed diastereodivergent coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. By carefully selecting the two metals and appropriate chiral ligands, we could synthesize both syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the same set of starting materials. Furthermore, stereodivergent syntheses of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols could be achieved. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of this method by concisely synthesizing two &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol natural products, mycestericins F and G.

         <title>Formation Mechanisms for Phosphorene and SnIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6816-6823, March 15, 2021. </description>

1D&#8208;SnIP and 2D&#8208;phosphorene are formed in a gas phase reaction of gaseous white phosphorus (P4) and SnI2 via P4 activation followed by successive helix or layer growth. P4 activation takes place by Sn2I4 dimers attracting the P&#8197;lone pairs (SnIP) or direct SnI2 insertion in a P&#8722;P bond (phosphorene). Both reaction mechanisms were studied between 0&#8197;K and synthesis temperature.







Abstract
Phosphorene&#8212;the monolayered material of the element allotrope black phosphorus (Pblack)&#8212;and SnIP are 2D and 1D semiconductors with intriguing physical properties. Pblack and SnIP have in common that they can be synthesized via short way transport or mineralization using tin, tin(IV) iodide and amorphous red phosphorus. This top&#8208;down approach is the most important access route to phosphorene. The two preparation routes are closely connected and differ mainly in reaction temperature and molar ratios of starting materials. Many speculative intermediates or activator side phases have been postulated especially for top&#8208;down Pblack/phosphorene synthesis, such as Hittorf's phosphorus or Sn24P19.3I8 clathrate. The importance of phosphorus&#8208;based 2D and 1D materials for energy conversion, storage, and catalysis inspired us to elucidate the formation mechanisms of these two compounds. Herein, we report on the reaction mechanisms of Pblack/phosphorene and SnIP from P4 and SnI2 via direct gas phase formation.

         <title>Transformable Honeycomb&#8208;Like Nanoassemblies of Carbon Dots for Regulated Multisite Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6581-6592, March 15, 2021. </description>

Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts&#8208;responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots are fabricated to program the sequential and spatiotemporal release of multiple therapeutic agents for synergetic chemoimmunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Tumor fibrotic stroma forms complex barriers for therapeutic nanomedicine. Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems. Herein, we report the development of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots (CDs) to spatially program the delivery of multiple therapeutics for enhanced antitumor chemoimmunotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic enhancer (Fe ions) are immobilized on the surface of CDs, whereas tumor microenvironment modifier (losartan, LOS) is encapsulated within the mesopores. The drugs&#8208;loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses. Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that the nanoassemblies exhibit effective T cells infiltration, tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis prevention, thereby providing a therapeutic platform for desmoplasia solid tumor.

Unprecedented low&#8208;coordinate carbodicarbene bismaalkene cations have been prepared which feature C
Bi double dative bonds. The synthesis of these compounds represents a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C=Bi double&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene&#8201;(CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple&#8208;bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and [(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2 (9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2 (12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3 (13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2 (7) and (CDC)BiBr3 (10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C
Bi double dative bonds and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations. The synthesis of these species highlights a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C&#8722;Bi &#960;&#8208;bonding character. The CDC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (7&#8211;13) were compared with related NHC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (1, 3&#8211;6) and show substantially different structural properties. Indeed, the CDC ligand has a remarkable influence on the overall stability of the resulting low&#8208;coordinate Bi complexes, suggesting that CDC is a superior ligand to NHC in heavy pnictogen chemistry.

         <title>Guest Exchange by a Partial Energy Ratchet in Water</title>

Cucurbiturils can be prime components to build energy ratchets in water. Guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli.







Abstract
Molecular machines are ubiquitous in nature and function away from equilibrium by consuming fuels to produce appropriate work. Chemists have recently excelled at mimicking the fantastic job performed by natural molecular machines with synthetic systems soluble in organic solvents. In efforts toward analogous systems working in water, we show that guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli. Ditolyl&#8208;viologen can also be exchanged using the best kinetic trap and interfaced with alginate, thus affording pH&#8208;responsive blue, fluorescent hydrogels. With tunable rate and binding constants toward relevant guests, cucurbiturils may become excellent ring molecules for the construction of advanced molecular machines working in water.

         <title>Growth of Colloidal Nanocrystals by Liquid&#8208;Like Coalescence**

Ligand&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles grow by liquid&#8208;like coalescence rather than Ostwald ripening in the absence of supersaturation. The effective activation energy of the coalescence process is associated with two factors: one is proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles and the other is related to the reconstruction. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles.







Abstract
We here describe, model, and predict the growth kinetics of amine&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of supersaturation. The particles grow by coalescence rather than by Ostwald ripening. A comparison of different models indicates that the effective activation energy of coalescence (67.65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is associated with two terms: a term proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles, and a constant term. Our Brownian dynamics simulations show (i) how the remarkably low activation energy (or large rate constants) are most likely due to the large difference in size between the particles and their mean free path of diffusion, and (ii) how the low polydispersity is the likely result of the suppression of collision rates between rare populations due to crowding. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles, therefore enabling the precise control of the average particle size without the need of supersaturation.

         <title>Enriching Structural Diversity of Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters with Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6699-6703, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of chloride and alkynyl as protecting agents leads to the formation of large gold nanoclusters. Silica gel column chromatography results in the successful isolation and crystallization of atomically precise gold nanoclusters [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), where L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. They are all superatomic clusters, and show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of alkynyl/chloride&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters is described. Silica gel column chromatography is effective in isolating gold nanoclusters from the as&#8208;synthesized cluster mixture to give the clusters Na[Au25L18] (Au25), [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. Au67 and Au106 are new clusters; the structures were determined by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Au67 contains a distorted Au18 Marks decahedron shelled by an irregular Au32 and further protected with two V&#8208;shaped Au2L3, 13 linear AuL2 staples and 4 chlorides. Au67 is the first structurally determined 34e superatomic gold nanocluster. Au106 is composed of 106 Au atoms co&#8208;protected by alkynyls and chlorides. It has a Au79 kernel, like in Au102(p&#8208;MBA)44. The surface structure of Au106 includes 20 linear Au&#8208;alkynyl staples, 5 Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl and 2 Cl&#8208;Au motifs. These three gold nanoclusters show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.

         <title>Probing Transient DNA Conformation Changes with an Intercalative Fluorescent Excimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6624-6630, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA intercalator, K21, can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA. The ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer was strongly correlated to DNA transient conformation stability. The K21 excimer can probe transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various length and shape. This label&#8208;free method can also probe the transient conformation change in single plasmid under supercoiled and open&#8208;circular states.







Abstract
Variation of DNA conformation is important in regulating gene expression and mediating drug&#8208;DNA interactions. However, directly probing transient DNA conformation changes is challenging owing to the dynamic nature of this process. We show a label&#8208;free fluorescence method to monitor transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various lengths and shapes using a DNA intercalator, K21. K21 can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA; the ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer correlate to DNA transient conformation stability in numerous DNA structures, including i&#8208;motifs, G&#8208;quadruplex structures, and single nucleotide mutation at random position. We analyzed the conformation dynamics of a single plasmid before and after enzyme digestion with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides a label&#8208;free fluorescence strategy to probe transient conformation changes of DNA structures and has potential in uncovering transient genomic processes in living cells.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Porous Molybdenum Phosphide/Nitride Heterojunction Nanosheets for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6673-6681, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets have been created based on a PEG&#8208;mediated assembly strategy, which exhibit outstanding performance for HER over wide pH ranges even out&#8208;performing the Pt/C benchmark at large current density. A series of tests and DFT calculations shows the synergy of the heterojunctions, pores and 2D nanosheets for promoting the HER performance.







Abstract
Herein, we present a new strategy for the synthesis of 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets based on the pyrolysis of 2D [PMo12O40]3&#8722;&#8208;melamine (PMo12&#8208;MA) nanosheet precursor from a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;mediated assembly route. The heterostructure nanosheets are ca. 20&#8197;nm thick and have plentiful pores (&lt;5&#8197;nm). These structure features offer advantages to promote the HER activity, including the favorable water dissociation kinetics around heterojunction as confirmed by theoretical calculations, large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets, and enhanced mass&#8208;transport ability by pores. Consequently, the 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets exhibit excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 89, 91 and 89&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively. The HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &gt;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral medium and &gt;190&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline medium.

&lt;p&gt;2D porous MoP/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N heterojunction nanosheets have been created based on a PEG&#8208;mediated assembly strategy, which exhibit outstanding performance for HER over wide pH ranges even out&#8208;performing the Pt/C benchmark at large current density. A series of tests and DFT calculations shows the synergy of the heterojunctions, pores and 2D nanosheets for promoting the HER performance.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Instability of the Superionic Halide Solid Electrolytes and the Implications for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6718-6723, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic halide solid electrolytes show excellent cathodic electrolyte properties in solid state batteries, but they are unstable in contact with the lithium metal anode. The forming solid electrolyte interphase is analyzed herein, using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is analyzed to highlight the concept of hybrid electrolyte cells.







Abstract
Owing to high ionic conductivity and good oxidation stability, halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes regain interest for application in solid&#8208;state batteries. While stability at the cathode interface seems to be given, the stability against the lithium metal anode has not been explored yet. Herein, the formation of a reaction layer between Li3InCl6 (Li3YCl6) and lithium is studied by sputter deposition of lithium metal and subsequent in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as by impedance spectroscopy. The interface is thermodynamically unstable and results in a continuously growing interphase resistance. Additionally, the interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is characterized by impedance spectroscopy to discern whether a combined use as cathode electrolyte and separator electrolyte, respectively, might enable long&#8208;term stable and low impedance operation. In fact, oxidation stable halide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors cannot be used against Li, but may be promising candidates as cathode electrolytes.

         <title>Surface Functionalized Sensors for Humidity&#8208;Independent Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6561-6566, March 15, 2021. </description>

A surface functionalization strategy, utilizing Co&#8208;MOF/PDMS as tandem coating layers, was proposed to overcome the problem of humidity sensitivity for semiconducting metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based gas sensors. This approach can be extended to various humidity&#8208;independent gas&#8208;sensing materials.







Abstract
Semiconducting metal oxides (SMOXs) are used widely for gas sensors. However, the effect of ambient humidity on the baseline and sensitivity of the chemiresistors is still a largely unsolved problem, reducing sensor accuracy and causing complications for sensor calibrations. Presented here is a general strategy to overcome water&#8208;sensitivity issues by coating SMOXs with a hydrophobic polymer separated by a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer that preserves the SMOX surface and serves a gas&#8208;selective function. Sensor devices using these nanoparticles display near&#8208;constant responses even when humidity is varied across a wide range [0&#8211;90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH)]. Furthermore, the sensor delivers notable performance below 20&#8201;% RH whereas other water&#8208;resistance strategies typically fail. Selectivity enhancement and humidity&#8208;independent sensitivity are concomitantly achieved using this approach. The reported tandem coating strategy is expected to be relevant for a wide range of SMOXs, leading to a new generation of gas sensors with excellent humidity&#8208;resistant performance.

         <title>Formic Acid&#8208;Assisted Selective Hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran over Bifunctional Pd Nanoparticles Supported on N&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon</title>

Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid and H2 over the bifunctional Pd/NMC catalyst within 2&#8197;h. Experimental investigation and DFT calculation revealed that formic acid significantly enhances the reaction rate and shifts the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via its protonation.







Abstract
Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is regarded as one of the most promising platform chemicals to produce 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran (DMF) as a potential liquid transportation fuel. Pd nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;containing and N&#8208;free mesoporous carbon materials were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under mild reaction conditions. Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid (FA) and H2 over Pd/NMC within 2&#8197;h. The reaction mechanism, especially the multiple roles of FA, was explored through a detailed comparative study by varying hydrogen source, additive, and substrate as well as by applying in situ ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The major role of FA is to shift the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via the protonation by FA at the C&#8208;OH group, lowering the activation barrier of the C&#8722;O bond cleavage and thus significantly enhancing the reaction rate. XPS results and DFT calculations revealed that Pd2+ species interacting with pyridine&#8208;like N atoms significantly enhance the selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;OH bond in the presence of FA due to their high ability for the activation of FA and the stabilization of H&#8722;.

         <title>The Discrete Breast Cancer Stem Cell Mammosphere Activity of Group 10&#8208;Bis(azadiphosphine) Metal Complexes</title>

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated to cancer relapse and metastasis. Herein, the breast CSC activities of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) complexes under exclusively three&#8208;dimensional cell culture conditions are systematically compared. Breast CSC mammosphere inhibition and potency was highly dependent on the Group 10 metal present.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of a series of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) complexes 1&#8211;3 under exclusively three&#8208;dimensional cell culture conditions. The breast CSC mammosphere potency of 1&#8211;3 is dependent on the Group 10 metal present, increasing in the following order: 1 (nickel complex) &lt;2 (palladium complex) &lt;3 (platinum complex). Notably, 3 reduces the formation and size of mammospheres to a greater extent than salinomycin, an established CSC&#8208;active compound, or any reported anti&#8208;CSC metal complex tested under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the most effective complexes 2 and 3 readily penetrate CSC mammospheres, enter CSC nuclei, induce genomic DNA damage, and trigger caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically probe the anti&#8208;CSC activity of a series of structurally related Group 10 complexes and to be conducted entirely using three&#8208;dimensional CSC culture conditions.

The breast CSC mammosphere potency of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is dependent on the Group 10 metal present, increasing in the following order: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (nickel complex) &amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (palladium complex) &amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; (platinum complex). Notably, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; reduces the formation and size of mammospheres to a greater extent than salinomycin, an established CSC&#8208;active compound, or any reported anti&#8208;CSC metal complex tested under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the most effective complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; readily penetrate CSC mammospheres, enter CSC nuclei, induce genomic DNA damage, and trigger caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically probe the anti&#8208;CSC activity of a series of structurally related Group 10 complexes and to be conducted entirely using three&#8208;dimensional CSC culture conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Chemical Upcycling of Mixed Plastics Guided by a Thermally Stable Organocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
The energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enable the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of plastic waste represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration, and potentially offers a solution to the environmental consequences of increased plastic waste. Most plastics that are widely used today are designed for durability, hence currently available depolymerisation methods typically require harsh conditions and when applied to blended and mixed plastic feeds generate a mixture of products. Herein, we demonstrate that the energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Employing the same procedure, functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend. This methodology demonstrates that the concept of catalytic depolymerisation offers great potential for selective polymer recycling and also presents plastic waste as a &#8220;greener&#8221; alternative feedstock for the synthesis of high added value molecules.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Unlocking Hyperpolarization with Metabolism**

A proton singlet state on fumarate derived from parahydrogen can be broken by enzymatic conversion to malate, which releases hyperpolarized NMR signals. We demonstrate two &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;phase echo&#8221; pulse sequences to convert the I1zI2z state into net proton magnetization, and show how this can be used for hyperpolarized 1H imaging.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study biomolecular processes in the body, but typically requires nuclei such as 13C, 15N, or 129Xe due to their long spin&#8208;polarization lifetimes and the absence of a proton&#8208;background signal from water and fat in the images. Here we present a novel type of 1H imaging, in which hyperpolarized spin order is locked in a nonmagnetic long&#8208;lived correlated (singlet) state, and is only liberated for imaging by a specific biochemical reaction. In this work we produce hyperpolarized fumarate via chemical reaction of a precursor molecule with para&#8208;enriched hydrogen gas, and the proton singlet order in fumarate is released as antiphase NMR signals by enzymatic conversion to malate in D2O. Using this model system we show two pulse sequences to rephase the NMR signals for imaging and suppress the background signals from water. The hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced 1H&#8208;imaging modality presented here can allow for hyperpolarized imaging without the need for low&#8208;abundance, low&#8208;sensitivity heteronuclei.

         <title>A Macromolecular Drug for Cancer Therapy via Extracellular Calcification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6509-6517, March 15, 2021. </description>

We propose a macromolecular&#8208;drug&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from blood. Polysialic acid combined with folate, which spontaneously induces biogenic mineral formation on cancer cells rich in folate receptors, leads to targeted pathological calcification and cell death. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia improves survival rates of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Cancer chemotherapy typically relies on drug endocytosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via intracellular pathways; however, severe side effects may arise. In this study, we performed a first attempt to develop macromolecular&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from the blood through a new type of drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), which selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells and results in the pathological calcification of tumors. The macromolecule&#8208;initiated extracellular calcification causes cancer cell death mainly by intervening with the glycolysis process in cancer cells. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibited cervical and breast tumor growth and dramatically improved survival rates in mice. This study provides an extracellular therapeutic approach for malignant tumor diseases via calcification that is ready for clinical trials and offers new insights into macromolecular anticancer drug discovery.

         <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium&#8208;Ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6600-6608, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient SEI structure with C&#8722;F rich surface for strong Li+ adsorption and LiF rich bottom for fast Li+ diffusion is designed by applying bisfluoroacetamide as electrolyte additive, which also helps to form a stable CEI on cathode, endowing stable lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
The structures and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structures to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8722;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li+ solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make a superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Large&#8208;Scale Membrane Transformations Driven by MinDE Biochemical Reaction Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6496-6502, March 15, 2021. </description>

We are demonstrating a new model membrane system, flat vesicles on top of a supported lipid bilayer. By reconstituting a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system, ATP&#8208;dissipating MinDE proteins, dynamic &#8220;breathing&#8221; deformations of the soft membrane vesicles and progressive membrane spreading are achieved, confirming that under this specific condition, MinDE reaction cycles can result in work performed on the biological membrane.







Abstract
The MinDE proteins from E.&#8197;coli have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer. MinDE oscillations can repeatedly deform these flat vesicles into tubules and promote progressive membrane spreading through membrane adhesion. Dependent on membrane and buffer compositions, Min oscillations further induce robust bud formation. Altogether, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, MinDE self&#8208;organization can result in work performed on biomimetic systems and achieve a straightforward mechanochemical coupling between the MinDE biochemical reaction cycle and membrane transformation.

&lt;p&gt;We are demonstrating a new model membrane system, flat vesicles on top of a supported lipid bilayer. By reconstituting a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system, ATP&#8208;dissipating MinDE proteins, dynamic &#8220;breathing&#8221; deformations of the soft membrane vesicles and progressive membrane spreading are achieved, confirming that under this specific condition, MinDE reaction cycles can result in work performed on the biological membrane.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MinDE proteins from &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer. MinDE oscillations can repeatedly deform these flat vesicles into tubules and promote progressive membrane spreading through membrane adhesion. Dependent on membrane and buffer compositions, Min oscillations further induce robust bud formation. Altogether, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, MinDE self&#8208;organization can result in work performed on biomimetic systems and achieve a straightforward mechanochemical coupling between the MinDE biochemical reaction cycle and membrane transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Resistance in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Macrolides Involving Cycles of Extracellular Oxidative Activation and Intracellular Reductive Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6639-6645, March 15, 2021. </description>

A self&#8208;resistance mechanism involving a cycle of extracellular oxidative activation and intracellular reductive inactivation was revealed by identifying the biosynthesis pathway of the macrolide antibiotic A26771B (1). This finding not only expands the understanding of resistance toward macrolide antibiotics, but also guides efforts to develop new antibiotics.







Abstract
Self&#8208;resistance genes are employed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self&#8208;harm. Herein, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (1), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus Penicillium egyptiacum. A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a trans&#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a cytochrome P450 and an acyltransferase, respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone&#8197;E (2). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms 1, while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms 2, forming a redox cycle. Our work illustrates a unique redox&#8208;mediated resistance mechanism for fungal antibiotics and contributes to the understanding of antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance.

         <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions With Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6653-6659, March 15, 2021. </description>

Piptides, a new form of chemotype, are accessible from natural amino acids in either configuration, hence can conveniently display all the side chain pharmacophores found in peptides and proteins. They can be made in solution or on supports and are proteolytically&#8208;/pH&#8208;robust. Piptide&#8208;based disruption of EGF&#8901;EGFR was chosen as an initial challenge and Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) was used to evaluate candidates.







Abstract
Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Molecular Weight Photoswitchable Hydrogelators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6764-6770, March 15, 2021. </description>

Small, photoswitchable (MW 258&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) arylazopyrazoles form self&#8208;assembled gels in water that can be reversibly cycled between a gel and solution state using two different excitation wavelengths that cause &#8220;thinning&#8221; of the gel fibers upon the light induced E to Z isomerisation. These materials could be used for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.







Abstract
Two photoswitchable arylazopyrozoles form hydrogels at a concentration of 1.2&#8201;% (w/v). With a molecular weight of 258.28&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1, these are the lowest known molecular weight hydrogelators that respond reversibly to light. Photoswitching of the E&#8208; to the Z&#8208;form by exposure to 365&#8197;nm light results in a macroscopic gel&#8594;sol transition; nearly an order of magnitude reduction in the measured elastic and loss moduli. In the case of the meta&#8208;arylazopyrozole, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy suggests that the 29&#177;7&#8197;nm wide sheets in the E&#8208;gel state narrow to 13&#177;2&#8197;nm upon photoswitching to the predominantly Z&#8208;solution state. Photoswitching for meta&#8208;arylazopyrozole is reversible through cycles of 365&#8197;nm and 520&#8197;nm excitation with little fatigue. The release of a rhodamine&#8197;B dye encapsulated in gels formed by the arylazopyrozoles is accelerated more than 20&#8208;fold upon photoswitching with 365&#8197;nm light, demonstrating these materials are suitable for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.

         <title>An Efficient Turing&#8208;Type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 Multi&#8208;Interfacial Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalyst**

A novel Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 structure has been synthesized, which possesses rich Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, exhibiting a 221&#8197;mV overpotential at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte with a high anodic energy efficiency of 84.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although the Turing structures, or stationary reaction&#8208;diffusion patterns, have received increasing attention in biology and chemistry, making such unusual patterns on inorganic solids is fundamentally challenging. We report a simple cation exchange approach to produce Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se on CoSe2 nanobelts relied on diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The resultant Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 material is highly effective to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes with an 84.5&#8201;% anodic energy efficiency. Electrochemical measurements show that the intrinsic OER activity correlates linearly with the length of Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, determining that such Turing&#8208;type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X&#8208;ray absorption and computational simulations, we ascribe the excellent OER performance to the optimized adsorption energies for critical oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates at the unconventional interfaces.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of 1,4&#8208;Azaborine Derivatives as Models of BN&#8208;doped PAHs</title>

         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;molecule conductance of 1,4&#8208;azaborine acene&#8208;type compounds was studied using the scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction technique. This substitution ensures an unambiguous electron path through both heteroatoms. A moderate change in conductance is observed when compared to the parent all&#8208;carbon structure. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transport calculations support the experimental results.







Abstract
The single&#8208;molecule conductance of a series of BN&#8208;acene&#8208;like derivatives has been measured by using scanning tunneling break&#8208;junction techniques. A strategic design of the target molecules has allowed us to include azaborine units in positions that unambiguously ensure electron transport through both heteroatoms, which is relevant for the development of customized BN&#8208;doped nanographenes. We show that the conductance of the anthracene azaborine derivative is comparable to that of the pristine all&#8208;carbon anthracene compound. Notably, this heteroatom substitution has also allowed us to perform similar measurements on the corresponding pentacene&#8208;like compound, which is found to have a similar conductance, thus evidencing that B&#8211;N doping could also be used to stabilize and characterize larger acenes for molecular electronics applications. Our conclusions are supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transport calculations.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Talented Gallaphosphene for Ga&#8722;P&#8722;Ga Heteroallyl Cation Generation, CO2 Storage, and C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

Oxidative addition of LGa to a phosphaketene&#8211;gallane yields gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL, from which the heteroallyl cation [LGaPGaL]+ is prepared by a halide abstraction reaction. Moreover, L(Cl)GaPGaL reversibly reacts with CO2 and selectively activates the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of acetophenone and acetone.







Abstract
Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL (2; L=HC[C(Me)N(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)]2), which is synthesized by reaction of LGa(Cl)PCO (1) with LGa, reacts with [Na(OCP)(dioxane)2.5] to LGa(OCP)PGaL (3), whereas chloride abstraction with LiBArF4 yields [LGaPGaL][BArF4] (4; BArF4=B(C6F5)4). 4 represents a heteronuclear analog of the allyl cation according to quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, 2 reversibly reacts with CO2 to yield L(Cl)Ga&#8722;P[&#956;&#8208;C(O)O]2GaL (5), while reactions with acetophenone and acetone selectively give compounds 6 and 7 by C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Cooperative Stapling of Native Peptides at Lysine and Tyrosine or Arginine with Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6646-6652, March 15, 2021. </description>

A cooperative strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine and nearby tyrosine or arginine residues with formaldehyde is reported.







Abstract
Stapling of peptides by intramolecular crosslinking of two neighboring amino acid side chains offers an important tool to modulate the structure and properties of peptides. In comparison to the stapling of artificially engineered peptide substrates, methods for stapling native peptides are more desirable for easier accessibility and genetic encodability. However, the existing strategy for selectivity control in the stapling of native peptides is relatively limited: the site of anchoring is often dominated by Cys, and the means for achieving the position selectivity among the same type of residues at different locations is lacking. We have developed a simple and powerful strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine residues with formaldehyde by the cooperation of nearby tyrosine or arginine residues. The stapling reactions can proceed with high efficiency and residue selectivity under mild conditions, and generate linchpins with distinct physiochemical properties. The new method for peptide stapling enables unique control of position&#8208;selectivity for substrates bearing multiple reaction sites by reactivity that can be readily built in the peptide sequence.

         <title>Tracking Reactions of Asymmetric Organo&#8208;Osmium Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysts in Cancer Cells</title>

This chiral organo&#8208;osmium complex catalyses enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cancer cells. The bromine tag on the chelated ligand and osmium have been jointly mapped in cells by X&#8208;ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, revealing facile displacement of the ligand and its translocation to the nucleus.







Abstract
Most metallodrugs are prodrugs that can undergo ligand exchange and redox reactions in biological media. Here we have investigated the cellular stability of the anticancer complex [OsII[(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(RR/SS&#8208;MePh&#8208;DPEN)] [1] (MePh&#8208;DPEN=tosyl&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine) which catalyses the enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cells. The introduction of a bromide tag at an unreactive site on a phenyl substituent of Ph&#8208;DPEN allowed us to probe the fate of this ligand and Os in human cancer cells by a combination of X&#8208;ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping and inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). The BrPh&#8208;DPEN ligand is readily displaced by reaction with endogenous thiols and translocated to the nucleus, whereas the Os fragment is exported from the cells. These data explain why the efficiency of catalysis is low, and suggests that it could be optimised by developing thiol resistant analogues. Moreover, this work also provides a new way for the delivery of ligands which are inactive when administered on their own.

         <title>Conformational Plasticity of Cyclic Ras&#8208;Inhibitor Peptides Defines Cell Permeabilization Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6567-6572, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational plasticity defines cell permeabilization activity: Cell permeabilization activities of cyclic Ras&#8208;inhibitor peptides are determined by the ability to adopt a cell&#8208;permeable amphipathic conformation, in which aromatic residues (green) are converged on one side and the Arg residues (blue) surround the aromatic residues, in a low polarity environment.







Abstract
Cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 are 11&#8208;mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras&#8208;Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;like motif; however, only cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell&#8208;based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three&#8208;dimensional structures of cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin&#8197;9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino&#8208;acid sidechains, Tle&#8208;2 and dVal&#8208;3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.

     alt="Conformational Plasticity of Cyclic Ras&#8208;Inhibitor Peptides Defines Cell Permeabilization Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conformational plasticity defines cell permeabilization activity: Cell permeabilization activities of cyclic Ras&#8208;inhibitor peptides are determined by the ability to adopt a cell&#8208;permeable amphipathic conformation, in which aromatic residues (green) are converged on one side and the Arg residues (blue) surround the aromatic residues, in a low polarity environment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 are 11&#8208;mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras&#8208;Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;like motif; however, only cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell&#8208;based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three&#8208;dimensional structures of cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin&#8197;9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino&#8208;acid sidechains, Tle&#8208;2 and dVal&#8208;3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Reagent for Amine&#8208;Directed Conjugation to IgG1 Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6539-6544, March 15, 2021. </description>

A method for site&#8208;directed conjugation to antibodies is developed, in which a first lysine both directs and activates the reagent for reaction with a neighboring lysine.







Abstract
Functionalized antibodies are an indispensable resource for diagnosis, therapy and as a research tool for chemical biology. However, simpler and better methodologies are often required to improve the labeling of antibodies in terms of selectivity and scalability. Herein, we report the development of an easily available chemical reagent that allows site&#8208;directed labeling of native human IgG1 antibodies in good yield and mono&#8208;labeling selectivity. The salicylaldehyde moiety of the reagent reacts with surface exposed lysine residues to transiently form an iminium ion, and this positions a semi&#8208;reactive ester in proximity of a second lysine residue that reacts with the ester to form an amide. Interestingly, it appears that the formation of the iminium ion also has a significant activating effect of the ester. We use flow cytometry and bio&#8208;layer interferometry to confirm that the labeled antibodies retain antigen binding.

         <title>Embedment of Quantum Dots and Biomolecules in a Dipeptide Hydrogel Formed In Situ Using Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6724-6732, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dipeptide hydrogel was obtained by dynamic assembly in the confined space of continuous&#8208;flow microfluidics. Organic porphyrins and inorganic quantum dots (QDs) were integrated in the system for energy transfer, and dynamic structural control over hydrogel formation and QD integration occurred within the microchannel network (see picture).







Abstract
As low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators, dipeptide hydrogel materials are suited for embedding multiple organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles. Herein, a simple but precisely controllable method is presented that enables the fabrication of dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogels by supramolecular assembly inside microfluidic channels. Water&#8208;soluble quantum dots (QDs) as well as premixed porphyrins and a dipeptide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were injected into a Y&#8208;shaped microfluidic junction. At the DMSO/water interface, the confined fabrication of a dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogel was initiated. Thereafter, the as&#8208;formed hydrogel flowed along a meandering microchannel in a continuous fashion, gradually completing gelation and QD entrapment. In contrast to hydrogelation in conventional test tubes, microfluidically controlled hydrogelation led to a tailored dipeptide hydrogel regarding material morphology and nanoparticle distribution.

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Catalytic C&#8722;H Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6660-6666, March 15, 2021. </description>

Catalytic C&#8722;H methylation proceeds efficiently under solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical conditions, including the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active substrates and otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;make metalacyclic complexes.







Abstract
The mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free, highly regioselective, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H methylation of (hetero)arenes is reported. The reaction shows excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility and is demonstrated to work for the late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H methylation of biologically active compounds. The method requires no external heating and benefits from considerably shorter reaction times than previous solution&#8208;based C&#8722;H methylation protocols. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach is shown to enable the efficient synthesis of organometallic complexes that are difficult to generate conventionally.

         <title>Tuning Photoinduced Electron Transfer in POM&#8208;Bodipy Hybrids by Controlling the Environment: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6518-6525, March 15, 2021. </description>

The intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer of a series of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;bodipy hybrids was examined. The data show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact on the relaxation dynamics of the excited states by modifying the solvation shell around the POM. The experimental findings were corroborated with a computational investigation combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulation methods.







Abstract
The optical and electrochemical properties of a series of polyoxometalate (POM) oxoclusters decorated with two bodipy (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) light&#8208;harvesting units were examined. Evaluated here in this polyanionic donor&#8208;acceptor system is the effect of the solvent and associated counterions on the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. The results show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact upon the energy of the charge&#8208;transfer state by modifying the solvation shell around the POMs. This modification leads to a significantly shorter charge separation time in the case of smaller counterion and slower charge recombination in a less polar solvent. These results were rationalized in terms of Marcus theory and show that solvent and counterion both affect the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer and the reorganization energy. This was corroborated with theoretical investigations combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.

Turing patterns have been widely seen in living systems. Nevertheless, the synthesis of chemical Turing&#8208;type structures in inorganic nanomaterials remains a huge challenge. In their Research Article on page&#8197;6553, Min&#8208;Rui Gao and co&#8208;workers constructed stationary Ag2Se Turing patterns on CoSe2 nanobelts via diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The new material consists of abundant Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, which are active sites that allow for favorable chemisorption of surface oxygenated species, leading to enhanced energetics for the oxygen evolution reaction.

A macromolecular drug , polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), was developed by Ruikang Tang, Ben Wang et&#8197;al. as an extracellular chemotherapy drug involving biomineralization for malignant tumor diseases in their Research Article on page&#8197;6509. The new type of drug combines with folate receptor and selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells via absorbing calcium from the blood, resulting in the pathological calcification of tumors. Administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibits tumor growth and dramatically improved the survival rates of mice.

Cell&#8208;selective imaging of metal ions was achieved by Lele Li and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;6300 by using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology. In the picture, the sensing activity is silent in normal cells and can be restored by an overexpressed enzyme in cancer cells through site&#8208;specific cleavage. The DNAzyme sensor allowed distinguishing metal&#8208;ion signals in tumor cells from healthy cells both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

Highly ordered coaggregates composed of quantum dots (QDs) and azobenzene derivatives were successfully constructed by Mitsuaki Yamauchi, Seiya Yamamoto, and Sadahiro Masuo in their Research Article on page&#8197;6473. The unique hybrid coaggregates have a uniformly arranged structure of QDs exhibiting inter&#8208;QD interactions such as energy transfer. In addition, the hybrid structures and their photophysical properties can be controlled by photoirradiation.

         <title>DNA Origami Meets Polymers: A Powerful Tool for the Design of Defined Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6218-6229, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of DNA origami with synthetic polymers results in a new class of materials with interesting properties and characteristics. This approach is more precise than conventional nanofabrication methods, such as the positioning of single polymer strands. This Minireview shows the potential preparation of nanostructures from polymers and two&#8208; or three&#8208;dimensional DNA origami.







Abstract
The combination of DNA origami nanostructures and polymers provides a new possibility to access defined structures in the 100&#8197;nm range. In general, DNA origami serves as a versatile template for the highly specific arrangement of polymer chains. Polymer&#8208;DNA hybrid nanostructures can either be created by growing the polymer from the DNA template or by attaching preformed polymers to the DNA scaffold. These conjugations can be of a covalent nature or be based on base&#8208;pair hybridization between respectively modified polymers and DNA origami. Furthermore, the negatively charged DNA backbone permits interaction with positively charged polyelectrolytes to form stable complexes.

     alt="DNA Origami Meets Polymers: A Powerful Tool for the Design of Defined Nanostructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of DNA origami with synthetic polymers results in a new class of materials with interesting properties and characteristics. This approach is more precise than conventional nanofabrication methods, such as the positioning of single polymer strands. This Minireview shows the potential preparation of nanostructures from polymers and two&#8208; or three&#8208;dimensional DNA origami.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of DNA origami nanostructures and polymers provides a new possibility to access defined structures in the 100&#8197;nm range. In general, DNA origami serves as a versatile template for the highly specific arrangement of polymer chains. Polymer&#8208;DNA hybrid nanostructures can either be created by growing the polymer from the DNA template or by attaching preformed polymers to the DNA scaffold. These conjugations can be of a covalent nature or be based on base&#8208;pair hybridization between respectively modified polymers and DNA origami. Furthermore, the negatively charged DNA backbone permits interaction with positively charged polyelectrolytes to form stable complexes. The combination of polymers with tuneable characteristics and DNA origami allows the creation of a new class of hybrid materials, which could offer exciting applications for controlled energy transfer, nanoscale organic circuits, or the templated synthesis of nanopatterned polymeric structures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Excited State Anions in Organic Transformations</title>

Photoactivated anions act as powerful single&#8208;electron reductants and can be used as either a catalyst or a reactant. In the presence of a base, their absorption is shifted bathochromically compared to the neutral molecules through deprotonation, with visible light often being sufficient for their excitation.







Abstract
Utilizing light is a smart way to fuel chemical transformations as it allows the energy to be selectively focused on certain molecules. Many reactions involving electronically excited species proceed via open&#8208;shell intermediates, which offer novel and unique routes to expand the hitherto used synthetic toolbox in organic chemistry. The direct conversion of non&#8208;prefunctionalized, less activated compounds is a highly desirable goal to pave the way towards more sustainable and atom&#8208;economic chemical processes. Photoexcited closed&#8208;shell anions have been shown to reach extreme potentials in single electron transfer reactions and reveal unusual excited&#8208;state reactivity. It is, therefore, surprising that their use as a reagent or photocatalyst is limited to a few examples. In this Review, we briefly discuss the characteristics of anionic photochemistry, highlight pioneering work, and show recent progress which has been made by utilizing photoexcited anionic species in organic synthesis.

Tricarbocyanine dyes are widely recognized as highly fluorescent compounds of use in a diverse range of biomedical and technical applications. This Minireview discusses the impact of different meso&#8208;substituents and how they may be used in the design of functional probes.







Abstract
Polymethine cyanine dyes have been widely recognized as promising chemical tools for a range of life science and biomedical applications, such as fluorescent staining of DNA and proteins in gel electrophoresis, fluorescence guided surgery, or as ratiometric probes for probing biochemical pathways. The photophysical properties of such dyes can be tuned through the synthetic modification of the conjugated backbone, for example, by altering aromatic cores or by varying the length of the conjugated polymethine chain. Alternative routes to shaping the absorption, emission, and photostability of dyes of this family are centered around the chemical modifications on the polymethine chain. This Minireview aims to discuss strategies for the introduction of substituents in the meso&#8208;position, their effect on the photophysical properties of these dyes and some structure&#8211;activity correlations which could help overcome common limitations in the state of the art in the synthesis.

         <title>Coenzymes and Their Role in the Evolution of Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6242-6269, March 15, 2021. </description>

Although coenzymes play key roles in biotic metabolism, they have not been in the focus as elements in protometabolism nor has their possible prebiotic generation been discussed in detail. This Review provides a conceptual view of the role of coenzymes with respect to known theories of protometabolism and their incorporation into the RNA world hypothesis.







Abstract
The evolution of coenzymes, or their impact on the origin of life, is fundamental for understanding our own existence. Having established reasonable hypotheses about the emergence of prebiotic chemical building blocks, which were probably created under palaeogeochemical conditions, and surmising that these smaller compounds must have become integrated to afford complex macromolecules such as RNA, the question of coenzyme origin and its relation to the evolution of functional biochemistry should gain new impetus. Many coenzymes have a simple chemical structure and are often nucleotide&#8208;derived, which suggests that they may have coexisted with the emergence of RNA and may have played a pivotal role in early metabolism. Based on current theories of prebiotic evolution, which attempt to explain the emergence of privileged organic building blocks, this Review discusses plausible hypotheses on the prebiotic formation of key elements within selected extant coenzymes. In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of life.

         <title>An Efficient Photochemical Route Towards Triplet Ethynylphosphinidene, HCCP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6400-6402, March 15, 2021. </description>

Triplet HCCP is produced as the final product of the UV induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3C&#8801;P, in solid Ar. Phosphaallene CH2=C=PH, and ethynylphosphine, HC&#8801;CPH2 are produced as H atoms are transferred along the CCP skeleton prior to dehydrogenation.







Abstract
While the archetypal free phosphinidene, H&#8208;P, has been studied for over a century, reports on uncomplexed, univalent phosphorus compounds are very sparse. Here we demonstrate production of HCCP in solid argon through the UV&#8208;induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3CP. Migration of H atoms along the CCP backbone of CH3CP resulted in production of the previously unobserved species 1&#8208;phosphapropadiene, CH2=C=PH, followed by ethynylphosphine, HCCPH2.

         <title>Backbone&#8208;Bridging Promotes Diversity in Heteroleptic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6403-6407, March 15, 2021. </description>

Rich structural variety in shape&#8208;complementary metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies is achieved by bridging ligands via their backbones. A series of unprecedented heteroleptic assemblies ranging from dimeric cages over a prismatic structure to a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedron were obtained. The influence of linker flexibility, solvent and presence of guest molecules was studied.







Abstract
The combination of shape&#8208;complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands LA and LB with PdII cations yields heteroleptic cages cis&#8208;[Pd2LA2LB2] by self&#8208;sorting. Herein, we report how such assemblies can be diversified by introduction of covalent backbone bridges between two LA units. Together with solvent and guest effects, the flexibility of these linkers can modulate nuclearity, topology, and number of cavities in a family of four structurally diverse assemblies. Ligand LA1, with flexible linker, reacts in CH3CN with its LB counterpart to a tetranuclear dimer D1. In DMSO, however, a trinuclear pseudo&#8208;tetrahedron T1 is formed. The product of LA2, with rigid linker, looks similar to D1, but with a rotated ligand arrangement. In presence of an anionic guest, this dimer D2 transforms and a hexanuclear prismatic barrel P2 crystallizes. We demonstrate how controlling a ligand's coordination mode can trigger structural differentiation and increase complexity in metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly.

&lt;/b&gt; counterpart to a tetranuclear dimer &lt;b&gt;D1&lt;/b&gt;. In DMSO, however, a trinuclear pseudo&#8208;tetrahedron &lt;b&gt;T1&lt;/b&gt; is formed. The product of &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, with rigid linker, looks similar to &lt;b&gt;D1&lt;/b&gt;, but with a rotated ligand arrangement. In presence of an anionic guest, this dimer &lt;b&gt;D2&lt;/b&gt; transforms and a hexanuclear prismatic barrel &lt;b&gt;P2&lt;/b&gt; crystallizes. We demonstrate how controlling a ligand's coordination mode can trigger structural differentiation and increase complexity in metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>&#8220;Excess&#8221; electrons in LuGe</title>

The germanium monogermanide is prepared by high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis. Chemical bonding in LuGe is described as covalently bonded zigzag chains of Ge atoms with the counterpart Lu4 polycations formed using excess electrons in sense of the Zintl count Lu3+(2b)Ge2&#8722;&#215;1&#8201;e&#8722;. The homonuclear bonding in polycation in Lu4Ge4, which makes use of the electrons not required in the polyanion, resembles the situation in Ga2Se2.







Abstract
The monogermanide LuGe is obtained via high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (5&#8211;15&#8197;GPa, 1023&#8211;1423&#8197;K). The crystal structure is solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data (structure type FeB, space group Pnma, a=7.660(2)&#8197;&#197;, b=3.875(1)&#8197;&#197;, and c=5.715(2)&#8197;&#197;, RF=0.036 for 206 symmetry independent reflections). The analysis of chemical bonding applying quantum&#8208;chemical techniques in position space was performed. It revealed&#8212;beside the expected 2c&#8208;Ge&#8208;Ge bonds in the germanium polyanion&#8212;rather unexpected four&#8208;atomic bonds between lutetium atoms indicating the formation of a polycation by the excess electrons in the system Lu3+(2b)Ge2&#8722;&#215;1&#8201;e&#8722;. Despite the reduced VEC of 3.5, lutetium monogermanide is following the extended 8&#8208;N rule with the trend to form lutetium&#8208;lutetium bonds utilizing the electrons left after satisfying the bonding needs in the anionic Ge&#8208;Ge zigzag chain.

         <title>Self&#8208;Pillared Ultramicroporous Carbon Nanoplates for Selective Separation of CH4/N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6339-6343, March 15, 2021. </description>

Self&#8208;pillared ultramicroporous carbon nanoplates have been prepared via a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential condensation, which exhibit a high selectivity and fast diffusion kinetics for CH4/N2 separation.







Abstract
There is growing evidence that pillaring up a densely packed ultramicroporous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is an effective strategy to reduce their internal diffusion. Reliable pillaring paradigms, however, is rather challenging. Here we report a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential assembly method for the preparation of a new self&#8208;pillared 2D polymer and ultramicroporous carbon with integrated surface protrusions. The molecular level pillaring process is surprisingly fast, that is, in 10&#8197;min. The thickness of nanoplate edge and the density (roughness), angle as well as height of protrusions can be precisely tuned. Exemplified in coal bed methane purification/separation, this unique pillared 2D carbons exhibit a CH4/N2 selectivity up to 24 at a low CH4 partial pressure and two orders of magnitude faster CH4 diffusion kinetics than the commercial carbon molecular sieves. This solution synthesis methodology is generalizable for creation and fine tuning of pillared 2D heterostructures.

         <title>Reactivity and Selectivity in Ruthenium Sulfur&#8208;Chelated Diiodo Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6372-6376, March 15, 2021. </description>

A diiodo trifluoromethyl sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium benzylidene complex was synthesized as precatalyst for olefin metathesis, allowing ring&#8208;opening metathesis of dicyclopentadiene in the presence of a methylene donor to produce 1,3&#8208;divinyl&#8208;hexahydropentalenes and depolymerization of polybutadiene upon green light irradiation. The selectivity displayed by the catalyst is attained through a fine balance between its rate of pre&#8208;activation and deactivation.







Abstract
A trifluoromethyl sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium benzylidene, Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I, was synthesized and characterized. This latent precatalyst provides a distinct activity and selectivity profiles for olefin metathesis reactions depending on the substrate. For example, 1,3&#8208;divinyl&#8208;hexahydropentalene derivatives were efficiently obtained by ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I also presented a much more effective photoisomerization process from the inactive cis&#8208;diiodo to the active trans&#8208;diiodo configuration after exposure to 510&#8197;nm (green light), allowing for a wide scope of photoinduced olefin metathesis reactions. DFT calculations suggest a faster formation and enhanced stability of the active trans&#8208;diiodo species of Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I compared with Ru&#8208;S&#8208;Ph&#8208;I, explaining its higher reactivity. In addition, the photochemical release of chloride anions by irradiation of Cl&#8208;BODIPY in the presence of DCPD derivatives with diiodo Ru benzylidenes, led to in situ generation of chloride complexes, which quickly produced the corresponding cross&#8208;linked polymers. Thus, novel selective pathways that use visible light to guide olefin metathesis based synthetic sequences is presented.

         <title>Locally Ordered Graphitized Carbon Cathodes for High&#8208;Capacity Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6326-6332, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC), interconnected with disordered carbon, is able to weaken the van der Waals interactions between adjacent graphene sheets and thus reduce the anion&#8208;intercalating voltage. Conversely, disordered carbon not only interconnects the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffers severe anion&#8211;anion repulsions and offers extra capacitive anion storage sites.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) inherently suffer from limited energy density. Proposed here is a strategy to effectively tackle this issue by employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion&#8211;anion repulsions and severe expansion at the deep&#8208;charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interactions, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8211;anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ketjen black (KB) with LOGC was used as a model cathode for a potassium&#8208;based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, a good rate capability of 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling stability of 1000&#8197;cycles without obvious capacity fading.

The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a good rate capability of 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and excellent cycling stability of 1000&#8197;cycles without obvious capacity fading.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Covalent Cell Surface Conjugation of Nanoparticles by a Combination of Metabolic Labeling and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6320-6325, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live cells can be efficiently conjugated with nanoparticles on their surface by two successive bioorthogonal click reactions. The 2&#8208;step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of ligand&#8208;decorated nanoparticles, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.







Abstract
Conjugation of nanoparticles (NP) to the surface of living cells is of interest in the context of exploiting the tissue homing properties of ex&#8197;vivo engineered T cells for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of drugs loaded into NP. Cell surface conjugation requires either a covalent or non&#8208;covalent reaction. Non&#8208;covalent conjugation with ligand&#8208;decorated NP (LNP) is challenging and involves a dynamic equilibrium between the bound and unbound state. Covalent NP conjugation results in a permanently bound state of NP, but the current routes for cell surface conjugation face slow reaction kinetics and random conjugation to proteins in the glycocalyx. To address the unmet need for alternative bioorthogonal strategies that allow for efficient covalent cell surface conjugation, we developed a 2&#8208;step click conjugation sequence in which cells are first metabolically labeled with azides followed by reaction with sulfo&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;dibenzyl cyclooctyne (Tz&#8208;DBCO) by SPAAC, and subsequent IEDDA with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) functionalized NP. In contrast to using only metabolic azide labeling and subsequent conjugation of DBCO&#8208;NP, our 2&#8208;step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of LNP, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.

         <title>Searching for Monomeric Nickel Tetrafluoride: Unravelling Infrared Matrix Isolation Spectra of Higher Nickel Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6391-6394, March 15, 2021. </description>

Molecular NiF3 and NiF4 are the missing tri&#8208; and tetrafluorides of the otherwise known binary first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal fluorides that are predicted to be stable. These elusive high&#8208;valent molecular nickel fluorides were identified in rare&#8208;gas matrices aided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical electronic structure calculations. They are among the most powerful known fluorination and oxidation agents.







Abstract
Binary transition metal fluorides are textbook examples combining complex electronic features with most fundamental molecular structures. High&#8208;valent nickel fluorides are among the strongest known fluorinating and oxidizing agents, but there is a lack of experimental structural and spectroscopic investigations on molecular NiF3 or NiF4. Apart from their demanding synthesis, also their quantum&#8208;chemical description is difficult due to their open shell nature and low&#8208;lying excited electronic states. Distorted tetrahedral NiF4 (D2d) and trigonal planar NiF3 (D3h) molecules were produced by thermal evaporation and laser ablation of nickel atoms in a fluorine/noble gas mixture and spectroscopically identified by a joint matrix&#8208;isolation and quantum&#8208;chemical study. Their vibrational band positions provide detailed insights into their molecular structures.

While the reduction of cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized isothiocyanatoboranes in the presence of a Lewis base yields tricoordinate isothiocyanatoborylenes, the reduction in the absence of a Lewis base yields the first examples of deep blue, boron&#8208;doped, aromatic thiazolothiazoles.







Abstract
Reduction of (CAAC)BBr2(NCS) (CAAC=cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene) in the presence of a Lewis base&#8197;L yields tricoordinate (CAAC)LB(NCS) borylenes which undergo reversible E/Z&#8208;isomerization. The same reduction in the absence of L yields deep blue, bis(CAAC)&#8208;stabilized, boron&#8208;doped, aromatic thiazolothiazoles resulting from the dimerization of dicoordinate (CAAC)B(NCS) borylene intermediates.

An efficient asymmetric hydroesterfication of diarylmethyl carbinols is developed with a Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst, resulting in a series of chiral 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins in excellent enantioselectivities and good yields. The method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, use of easily accessible starting materials, and low palladium loadings. A plausible stereochemical model is proposed with the Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient asymmetric hydroesterfication of diarylmethyl carbinols is developed for the first time with a Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst, resulting in a series of chiral 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins in excellent enantioselectivities and good yields. The method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, use of easily accessible starting materials, and low palladium loadings. A plausible stereochemical model is also proposed with the Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst. This method has enabled a 4&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;tolterodine from readily available starting materials.

         <title>Accessing the Next Generation of Synthetic Mussel&#8208;Glue Polymers via Mussel&#8208;Inspired Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6408-6413, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of mussel&#8208;glue&#8208;inspired polymers by using simple one&#8208;pot chemistry based on commodity monomers that are available in large scale offers many opportunities. A chemical oxidation route to convert commodity monomers to bisquinones is presented. These can be polymerized in Michael&#8208;type polyaddition reactions with various dithiols, which provides a modular set of glues with adhesive thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities in their backbones.







Abstract
The formation of cysteinyldopa as biogenic connectivity in proteins is used to inspire a chemical pathway toward mussel&#8208;adhesive mimics. The mussel&#8208;inspired polymerization (MIPoly) exploits the chemically diverse family of bisphenol monomers that is oxidizable with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid to give bisquinones. Those react at room temperature with dithiols in Michael&#8208;type polyadditions, which leads to polymers with thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities (TCC). A set of TCC polymers proved adhesive behavior even on challenging poly(propylene) substrates, where they compete with commercial epoxy resins in dry adhesive strength. MIPoly promises facile scale up and exhibits high modularity to tailor adhesives, as proven on a small library where one candidate showed wet adhesion on aluminum substrates in both water and sea water models.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Singlet SnI&#8197;Diradical and H2&#8197;Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6414-6418, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative 4 with two&#8208;coordinated SnI atoms has been isolated as a green crystalline solid. The ground state of 4 is an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) with the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T) of 4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (according to CASSCF, &#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Consequently, 4 exhibits a half&#8208;field EPR signal at 100&#8197;K and undergoes H2 splitting at room temperature to quantitatively yield the SnII hydride 5 as an orange solid.







Abstract
The first SnI diradical [(ADCPh)Sn]2 (4) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADCPh={CN(Dipp)}2CPh; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) scaffold has been isolated as a green crystalline solid by KC8 reduction of the corresponding bis&#8208;chlorostannylene [(ADCPh)SnCl]2 (3). The six&#8208;membered C4Sn2&#8208;ring of 4 containing six &#960;&#8208;electrons shows a diatropic ring current, thus 4 may also be regarded as the first 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative. DFT calculations suggest an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) ground state of 4 with a remarkably small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which is consistent with CASSCF (&#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and diradical character y=37&#8201;%) calculations. The diradical 4 splits H2 at room temperature to yield the bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADCPh)SnH]2 (5). Further reactivity of 4 has been studied with PhSeSePh and MeOTf.

         <title>Topological&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Driven Amorphous Spherical Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6362-6366, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous spherically&#8208;shaped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) microcavities have been constructed by amorphizing MOFs with a topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks, which possess a Q factor as high as &#8776;104 and can provide sufficient feedback for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. The results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining the excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOF microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOF microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with a topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as &#8776;104 and can provide sufficient feedback for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOF&#8208;based photonic components.

         <title>Sensitive and Repeatable Photoinduced Luminescent Radicals from A&#8201;Simple Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6367-6371, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous dual&#8208;channel switching of luminescence and conducting can be achieved from a simple organic crystal by UV irradiation, which is because of the sensitive and repeatable generation of photoinduced luminescent radicals inside.







Abstract
Photoinduced organic radicals are important for chemical and physical processes of organic materials, which are extensively investigated and applied in organic synthesis, photoelectronic devices and biotechnology. However, there are rare reports of the luminescence for these photoinduced radicals, especially in the condensed state. Herein, an unexpected and interesting luminescent radical is described, which can be rapidly and reversibly generated from a simple organic crystal by gentle light irradiation in air. It was revealed that the twist and asymmetric conformation of isolated molecule in its crystal with only weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions, which led to the generation of such photoinduced luminescent radicals. In addition, dual&#8208;channel photosensitive device with rapid response and well repeatability can be obtained based on the thin film of this organic crystal, showing both photoswitching on luminescence and conducting.

A Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units with a strong intramolecular electric field is prepared and used as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The best PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTM show a record efficiency of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the excellent stability.







Abstract
Low conductivity and hole mobility in the pristine metal phthalocyanines greatly limit their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). Here, we prepare a Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units as HTMs. In NiPc, the two oxygen atoms in peripheral substituent have a modified effect on the dipole direction, while the central Ni atom contributes more electron to phthalocyanine ring, thus efficiently increasing the intramolecular dipole. Calculation analyses reveal the extracted holes within NiPc are mainly concentrated on the phthalocyanine core induced by the intramolecular electric field, and further to be transferred by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking space channel between NiPc molecules. Finally, the best efficiency of PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTMs realizes a record value of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the good moisture, heating and light stabilities. This work provides a novel way to improve the performance of PSCs with free&#8208;doped metal phthalocyanines as HTMs.

Electrochemical rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble seven&#8208;membered benzoxepines have been accomplished guided by detailed mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Electrooxidative annulations involving mild transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation have emerged as a transformative strategy for the rapid construction of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. In contrast, we herein describe the first electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble valuable seven&#8208;membered benzoxepine skeletons by C&#8722;H/O&#8722;H activation. The efficient alkyne annulation featured ample substrate scope, using electricity as the only oxidant. Mechanistic studies provided strong support for a rhodium(III/I) regime, involving a benzoxepine&#8208;coordinated rhodium(I) sandwich complex as the catalyst resting state, which was re&#8208;oxidized to rhodium(III) by anodic oxidation.

         <title>Interrupted Pyridine Hydrogenation: Asymmetric Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams</title>

The metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of arenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful transformation to yield saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Yet, this transformation is limited to the sole formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we present a method to synthesize enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines. Crucial for this reaction is the interruption of the arene reduction by nucleophilic substitution.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an effective method to transform readily available arenes into saturated motifs, however, current hydrogenation strategies are limited to the formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. The stepwise addition of hydrogen yields reactive unsaturated intermediates that are rapidly reduced. In contrast, the interruption of complete hydrogenation by further functionalization of unsaturated intermediates offers great potential for increasing chemical complexity in a single reaction step. Overcoming the tenet of full reduction in arene hydrogenation has been seldom demonstrated. In this work we report the synthesis of sought&#8208;after, enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines and water by an interrupted hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Color, Bleaching&#8208;Resistant Super&#8208;Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging with Oligonucleotide&#8208;Based Exchangeable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6310-6313, March 15, 2021. </description>

Fluorophore labels that transiently bind to and unbind from a protein target allow photobleaching in super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) to be circumvented. Using short fluorophore&#8208;labeled DNA oligonucleotides, we demonstrate high&#8208;contrast, low&#8208;background, and multi&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging with SOFI.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing intensity fluctuations of statistically independent emitters in a time series of images. The final images are background&#8208;free and show confocality and enhanced spatial resolution (super&#8208;resolution). Fluorophore photobleaching, however, is a key limitation for recording long time series of images that will allow for the calculation of higher order SOFI results with correspondingly increased resolution. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be circumvented by using fluorophore labels that reversibly and transiently bind to a target, and which are being replenished from a buffer which serves as a reservoir. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled short DNA oligonucleotides, we labeled cellular structures with target&#8208;specific antibodies that contain complementary DNA sequences and record the fluctuation events caused by transient emitter binding. We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two&#8208;color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.

         <title>Pt/MnO2 Nanoflowers Anchored to Boron Nitride Aerogels for Highly Efficient Enrichment and Catalytic Oxidation of Formaldehyde at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6377-6381, March 15, 2021. </description>

A three&#8208;dimensional monolithic Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN catalyst was prepared by anchoring Pt/MnO2 nanoflower on boron nitride (BN) aerogels. The as&#8208;formed porous aerogels catalyst offers a combination of adsorption and oxidation to efficiently remove formaldehyde at room temperature, as well as easier recycling and reuse in comparison with powdery catalysts.







Abstract
The catalytic room temperature oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO) is widely considered as a viable method for the abatement of indoor toxic HCHO pollution. Herein, Pt/MnO2 nanoflowers anchored to boron nitride aerogels (Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN) were fabricated for the catalytic room temperature oxidation of HCHO. The three&#8208;dimensional Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN aerogels demonstrated superior catalytic activity as a result of the improved diffusion of the reactant molecules within the porous structure. Furthermore, the porous aerogels displayed excellent HCHO adsorption capacities, which promote a rapid HCHO gas&#8208;phase concentration reduction and a subsequent complete oxidation of the adsorbed HCHO. The combined adsorption and oxidation properties of the Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN aerogels enhance the oxidative removal of HCHO. The optimized Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN demonstrated excellent catalytic activity toward HCHO (200&#8197;ppm) at room temperature, achieving a 96&#8201;% formaldehyde conversion after 50&#8197;min.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Engineered DNAzyme Sensor for Cell&#8208;Selective Imaging of Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6300-6304, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activatable engineering strategy was developed to generate a new DNAzyme sensor technology. The catalytic sensing probe remained silent in normal cells but could be reactivated by a cancer&#8208;specific enzyme, thus enabling metal&#8208;ion signals to be identified as occurring in tumor cells as opposed to normal cells both in vitro and in vivo (see picture).







Abstract
There is intense interest in imaging intracellular metal ions because of their vital roles in many cellular processes. The challenge has been to develop chemical approaches that can detect metal ions in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Herein we report the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology that can distinguish metal&#8208;ion signals in tumor cells from those in normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the sensing activity of a traditional DNAzyme sensor was inhibited by engineering with a blocking sequence containing an abasic site that can be cleaved by cancer&#8208;specific enzymes and thus enables the selective recovery of metal&#8208;ion sensing capability in cancer cells. We demonstrated that the DNAzyme sensor not only enables cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective sensing and imaging of metal ions through an enzymically activated pathway, but also precise control over its metal&#8208;ion sensing activity in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. We envision the use of this biosensing technology to probe the biological roles of diverse metal ions in specific diseases.

         <title>Efficient Amination of Activated and Non&#8208;Activated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with a Simple Iron&#8211;Phenanthroline Catalyst</title>

A readily available catalytic system composed of iron(II) chloride and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline is widely applicable for the ring&#8208;closing C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;benzoyloxyurea. High yields are provided both for activated and completely non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A readily available catalyst consisting of iron dichloride in combination with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;benzoyloxyurea to form imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in high yields. The C&#8722;H amination reaction is very general and applicable to benzylic, allylic, propargylic, and completely non&#8208;activated aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and it also works for C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds. The surprisingly simple method can be performed under open flask conditions.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Anilines to Azobenzenes and Azoxybenzenes by a Molecular Mo Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6382-6385, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of azobenzene compounds and azoxybenzene compounds with N=N bonds was performed by a molecular molybdenum oxide compound [N(C4H9)4]2[Mo6O19] (simplified as Mo6) under mild conditions. A series of symmetric and asymmetric azobenzenes and azoxybenzenes were produced in high yield and selectivity by changing additive and solvent. Moreover, the catalytic mechanism of the reaction system was also assumed appropriately.







Abstract
Aromatic azo compounds, which play an important role in pharmaceutical and industrial applications, still face great challenges in synthesis. Herein, we report a molybdenum oxide compound, [N(C4H9)4]2[Mo6O19] (1), catalyzed selective oxidation of anilines with hydrogen peroxide as green oxidant. The oxidation of anilines can be realized in a fully selectively fashion to afford various symmetric/asymmetric azobenzene and azoxybenzene compounds, respectively, by changing additive and solvent, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest the intermediacy of highly active reactive and elusive Mo imido complexes.

         <title>Activation of Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane: Access to (tBuCP)n (n=2,&#8197;4) Ligand Frameworks by P&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>

Reactions of (tBuCP)2 with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes result in P&#8722;C bond scission and the coupling of (tBuCP)2 units. The resulting metal complexes feature uncommon phosphaorganic frameworks and an intriguing subsequent reactivity. These results illustrate that (tBuCP)2 can be used as a building block for unusual phosphaorganometallic compounds.







Abstract
The first mixed phosphatetrahedranes were reported only recently and their reactivity is virtually unexplored. Herein, we present a reactivity study on di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (1), which is the dimer of tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne. The (tBuCP)2 tetrahedron is activated selectively by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes, resulting in novel complexes featuring diverse (tBuCP)n&#8208;frameworks (n=2,&#8197;4). Release of the (tBuCP)4 framework from one of the complexes was achieved by addition of CO gas. Furthermore, 1 can be used as a source for P2&#8197;units by elimination of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylacetylene in the coordination sphere of nickel.

         <title>Cocrystal Engineering: Toward Solution&#8208;Processed Near&#8208;Infrared 2D Organic Cocrystals for Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6344-6350, March 15, 2021. </description>

A large&#8208;area cocrystal film is designed and fabricated in a low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed method. Attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the generation of long&#8208;lived free carriers, and the device configuration optimization, the cocrystal film&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a high responsivity to a wide spectra range, coupled with fast response times and large EQE.







Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D cocrystals with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption have been designed and prepared. Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C60 (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystal with absorption wavelength up to 1080&#8197;nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Owing to the highly ordered donor&#8211;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is enhanced and is comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6&#8197;s. The excellent device performance is attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and optimization of device configuration.

Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystal with absorption wavelength up to 1080&#8197;nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Owing to the highly ordered donor&#8211;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is enhanced and is comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424&#8197;mA&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6&#8197;s. The excellent device performance is attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and optimization of device configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Chiral Pentafluorinated Isopropyl Group via Iodine(I)/(III) Catalysis</title>

The iodine(I)/(III) catalysed construction of an enantioenriched fluorinated isostere of the iPr group is reported. The difluorination of readily accessible &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;styrenes is enabled by the in situ generation of a chiral ArIF2 species to forge a stereocentre with the substituents F, CH2F and CF3 (up to 95&#8201;%, &gt;20:1 vic:gem difluorination). Catalyst editing for preliminary validation of enantioselectivity is placed on a structural foundation.

         <title>Bismuth Amides Mediate Facile and Highly Selective Pn&#8211;Pn Radical&#8208;Coupling Reactions (Pn=N, P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6441-6445, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of bismuth amides of type [Bi(NAr2)3] has been synthesized and characterized. Remarkably, they readily release aminyl radicals (NAr2). and facilitate highly selective radical coupling to give (NAr2)2. Bismuth amides mediate the selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 (Pn=N, P, As), including very challenging substrates. Conditions, mechanisms, and substrate scopes are complementary or superior to those of more established procedures.







Abstract
The controlled release of well&#8208;defined radical species under mild conditions for subsequent use in selective reactions is an important and challenging task in synthetic chemistry. We show here that simple bismuth amide species [Bi(NAr2)3] readily release aminyl radicals [NAr2]. at ambient temperature in solution. These reactions yield the corresponding hydrazines, Ar2N&#8722;NAr2, as a result of highly selective N&#8722;N coupling. The exploitation of facile homolytic Bi&#8722;Pn bond cleavage for Pn&#8722;Pn bond formation was extended to higher homologues of the pnictogens (Pn=N&#8211;As): homoleptic bismuth amides mediate the highly selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 to give R2Pn&#8722;PnR2. Analyses by NMR and EPR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and DFT calculations reveal low Bi&#8722;N homolytic bond&#8208;dissociation energies, suggest radical coupling in the coordination sphere of bismuth, and reveal electronic and steric parameters as effective tools to control these reactions.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterogenolysis of Carbon Oxygen Bonds towards Deuterated Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6357-6361, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and easily scalable protocol for deuterogenolysis of carbon oxygen bonds was developed, which leads to a practical approach to synthetically valuable benzyl&#8208;deuterated building blocks and deuterium medicines, including atomoxetine, tesmilifene, amiodarone, and ibuprofen. Combining the in&#8197;situ electrocatalytic heavy water&#8208;splitting, this protocol enables the direct utilization of D2O for construction of high value&#8208;added deuterated chemicals and pharmaceuticals from low costing and easily available alcohols and ketones.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of deuterium into drug molecules to study and improve their biological properties is crucial for drug discovery and development. Herein, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed room&#8208;temperature deuterogenolysis of carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds in alcohols and ketones with D2 balloon for practical synthesis of deuterated pharmaceuticals and chemicals with benzyl&#8208;site (sp3 C&#8722;H) D&#8208;incorporation. The highlights of this deoxygenative deuteration strategy are mild conditions, broad scope, practicability and high chemoselectivity. To enable the direct use of D2O, electrocatalytic D2O&#8208;splitting is adapted to in&#8197;situ supply D2 on demand. With this system, the precise incorporation of deuterium in the metabolic position (benzyl&#8208;site) of ibuprofen is demonstrated in a sustainable and practical way with D2O.

         <title>Flow Technology for Telescoped Generation, Lithiation and Electrophilic (C3) Functionalization of Highly Strained 1&#8208;Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6395-6399, March 15, 2021. </description>

Strained&#8230;.in Flow! The first telescoped continuous flow protocol for the generation, lithiation, and electrophilic trapping of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane is reported. Several structurally unique C3&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes were prepared using this strategy starting from readily available starting materials.







Abstract
Strained compounds are privileged moieties in modern synthesis. In this context, 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are appealing structural motifs that can be employed as click reagents or precursors to azetidines. We herein report the first telescoped continuous flow protocol for the generation, lithiation, and electrophilic trapping of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The flow method allows for exquisite control of the reaction parameters, and the process operates at higher temperatures and safer conditions with respect to batch mode. The efficiency of this intramolecular cyclization/C3&#8208;lithiation/electrophilic quenching flow sequence is documented with more than 20 examples.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered, Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Self&#8208;Assembly of Aqueous Arylazopyrazoles at the Air&#8211;Water Interface and Switching of Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>

Macroscopically oriented, large polar crystalline films were fabricated at the air&#8211;water interface by photoisomerization of a cis&#8208;arylazopyrazole derivative dissolved in the aqueous phase. The trans&#8208;film formed on the solid substrate showed reversible photo&#8208;induced phase changes between the polar crystal and liquid phase, which lead to an on/off photo&#8208;switching of the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation intensity.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;p&#8208;methoxy arylazopyrazole spontaneously forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar crystals, which reversibly undergo liquefaction upon photoisomerization to the cis&#8208;isomer. This liquid cis&#8208;isomer has a large electric dipole moment and is highly soluble in water (solubility up to &#8776;58&#8197;mM), which is remarkably higher than that of the trans&#8208;isomer (690&#8197;&#956;M). Vis&#8208;light illumination of the aqueous cis&#8208;isomer generates macroscopically oriented, non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals at the air&#8211;water interface. Polar crystals are also formed in sandwich glass cells (spacing, 20&#8197;&#956;m) upon photo&#8208;induced crystallization of the liquid cis&#8208;isomer. The trans&#8208;crystals thus formed showed second harmonic generation (SHG) whose intensity is switched on/off in response to the photo&#8208;induced phase transition.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Oxythiophosphate Approaching the Good Balance with Wide Ultraviolet Transparency, Strong Second Harmonic Effect, and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6386-6390, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on first&#8208;principles and experimental studies, the design strategy from (PO4)3&#8722; to (PO3S)3&#8722; is confirmed to enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining large band gap. The oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S with novel motif of (H2PO3S)&#8722; is accordingly predicted to exhibit better UV NLO balance than KH2PO4, including larger birefringence, stronger SHG effect, and shorter phase&#8208;matching SHG wavelength.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) transparency, second harmonic effect and optical birefringence are three vital but mutually restrictive factors in the application of UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. It is difficult for traditional phosphates to achieve a good balance among these factors. In this communication, we propose that the structural evolution of the NLO motif from traditional phosphate to oxythiophosphate would enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining wide UV transparency, which is confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and preliminary experimental measurements. Following this strategy, we predict that, compared with the well&#8208;known NLO phosphate KH2PO4, the oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S exhibits better balance for the UV NLO performance, including wide UV transparency (UV cutoff down to 203&#8197;nm), strong SHG effect (ca. 0.9&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1), and large birefringence (ca. 0.1 at 1&#8197;&#956;m) with short phase&#8208;matching SHG output wavelength (&#8776;214&#8197;nm).

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electrochemical Reduction with Atomically Precise Surface Modification on Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6351-6356, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification with Cd atom doping generates the Au19Cd2(SR)16 nanocluster, which exhibits significantly boosted CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance, doubling that of the undoped Au23. DFT calculations reveal that local surface Cd doping leads to a dynamic behavior of the sulfur active site on Au19Cd2 when interacting with CO, contributing to the energetically favorable formation of CO on the exposed sulfur active site that facilitates the overall CO2RR.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (NCs) are promising catalytic materials for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work an atomic level modification of a Au23 NC is made by substituting two surface Au atoms with two Cd atoms, and it enhances the CO2RR selectivity to 90&#8211;95&#8201;% at the applied potential between &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V, which is doubled compared to that of the undoped Au23. Additionally, the Cd&#8208;doped Au19Cd2 exhibits the highest CO2RR activity (2200&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) among the reported NCs. This synergetic effect between Au and Cd is remarkable. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that the exposure of a sulfur active site upon partial ligand removal provides an energetically feasible CO2RR pathway. The thermodynamic energy barrier for CO formation is 0.74&#8197;eV lower on Au19Cd2 than on Au23. These results reveal that Cd doping can boost the CO2RR performance of Au NCs by modifying the surface geometry and electronic structure, which further changes the intermediate binding energy. This work offers insights into the surface doping mechanism of the CO2RR and bimetallic synergism.

         <dc:description>Advanced porous materials (APMs) &#8211; such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs) &#8211; have emerged as an exciting research frontier of chemistry and materials science.

         <title>A Fast Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Glassy Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glassy polyurethane (GPU) assembled by linear oligomers carrying abundant weak hydrogen bonds is presented. It is not only colorless, transparent, and stiff, but also shows fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing owing to the high mobility of the loosely packed hydrogen bonds in the glassy state. Molecular&#8208;level events that occur in this process are established.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized a colorless transparent glassy polyurethane assembled using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight oligomers carrying a large number of loosely packed weak hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds), which has a glass transition temperature (Tg) up to 36.8&#8201;&#176;C and behaves unprecedentedly robust stiffness with a tensile Young's modulus of 1.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa. Fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing was observed in this polymer network: the broken glassy polyurethane (GPU) specimen can recover to a tensile strength up 7.74&#177;0.76&#8197;MPa after healing for as little as 10&#8197;min, which is prominent compared to reported room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers. The high density of loose&#8208;packed hydrogen bonds can reversibly dissociate/associate below Tg of GPU (that is secondary relaxation), which enables the reconfiguration of the damaged network in the fractured interfaces, despite the extremely slow diffusion dynamics of molecular chains under room temperature. This GPU shows potential application as an optical lens.

&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 36.8&#8201;&#176;C and behaves unprecedentedly robust stiffness with a tensile Young's modulus of 1.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa. Fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing was observed in this polymer network: the broken glassy polyurethane (GPU) specimen can recover to a tensile strength up 7.74&#177;0.76&#8197;MPa after healing for as little as 10&#8197;min, which is prominent compared to reported room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers. The high density of loose&#8208;packed hydrogen bonds can reversibly dissociate/associate below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of GPU (that is secondary relaxation), which enables the reconfiguration of the damaged network in the fractured interfaces, despite the extremely slow diffusion dynamics of molecular chains under room temperature. This GPU shows potential application as an optical lens.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Inhibitor of SETDB1 Tudor Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first potent and selective small&#8208;molecule SETDB1 tandem tudor domain (TTD) inhibitor, (R,R)&#8208;59, is reported. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder&#8208;competitive inhibitor and also showed activities in intact cells. The enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show any activity.







Abstract
SET domain bifurcated protein 1 (SETDB1) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the silencing of some tumour suppressor genes and is overexpressed in many cancers. SETDB1 contains a unique tandem tudor domain (TTD) that recognizes histone H3 sequences containing both methylated and acetylated lysines. Beginning with the identification of a hit compound (Cpd1), we discovered the first potent and selective small molecule SETDB1&#8208;TTD inhibitor (R,R)&#8208;59 through stepwise structure&#8208;guided optimization. (R,R)&#8208;59 showed a KD value of 0.088&#177;0.045&#8197;&#956;M in the ITC assay. The high potency of (R,R)&#8208;59 was well explained by the cocrystal structure of the (R,R)&#8208;59&#8208;TTD complex. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder competitive inhibitor. Evidence has also demonstrated its cellular target engagement. Interestingly, the enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show activity in all the assays, highlighting the potential of (R,R)&#8208;59 as a tool compound in exploring the biological functions of SETDB1&#8208;TTD.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Desymmetrizing Fischer Indolization through Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones, containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups, is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution. Catalyzed by a combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2, this reaction delivers cyclopenta[b]indolones, containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, with up to 98.5:1.5 e.r.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). Catalyzed by the combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2 (Lewis acid assisted Br&#248;nsted acid), this direct approach combines 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones with N&#8208;protected phenylhydrazines to furnish cyclopenta[b]indole derivatives containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter with good to excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Carbons: Half Covalent, Half Ionic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen global minima of the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series contain a true planar hexacoordinate carbon. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that the carbon atom is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.







Abstract
Herein, the first global minima containing a planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) atom are reported. The fifteen structures belong to the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series and satisfy both geometric and electronic criteria to be considered as a true phC. The design strategy consisted of replacing oxygen in the D3h&#8197;CO3Li3+ structure with heavy and less electronegative chalcogens, inducing a negative charge on the C&#8197;atom and an attractive electrostatic interaction between C and the alkali&#8208;metal cations. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.

         <title>High&#8208;Silica CHA Zeolite Membrane with Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity and Irradiation Stability for Krypton/Xenon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes show ultra&#8208;high Kr/Xe selectivity and superior hydrothermal stability. Together with their irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes can pave the way to enrich radioactive 85Kr from xenon for a notable decrease in the volatile nuclear waste volume.







Abstract
Capture and storage of the long&#8208;lived 85Kr is an efficient approach to mitigate the emission of volatile radionuclides from the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. However, it is challenging to separate krypton (Kr) from xenon (Xe) because of the chemical inertness and similar physical properties. Herein we prepared high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes with ultra&#8208;high selectivity and irradiation stability for Kr/Xe separation. The suitable aperture size and rigid framework endures the membrane a strong size&#8208;exclusion effect. The ultrahigh selectivity of 51&#8211;152 together with the Kr permeance of 0.7&#8211;1.3&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 of high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes far surpass the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric membranes. The membrane is among the most stable polycrystalline membranes for separation of humid Kr/Xe mixtures. Together with the excellent irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes pave the way to separate radioactive Kr from Xe for a notable reduction of the volatile nuclear waste storage volume.

Amine&#8208;tagged defective Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is prepared by solvothermal synthesis using aminosalicylic acid as a functionalized fragmented ligand, as described by Seung&#8197;Bin Baek, Myoung Soo Lah and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100456). The covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification and subsequent post&#8208;synthetic metalation with Pd(II) ions affords a Pd(II)&#8208;incorporated Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 catalyst, which exhibits highly efficient, size&#8208;selective, and recyclable catalytic activity for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multinuclear precious metal sandwich complexes containing an asymmetric center in the cluster are synthesized in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101460) by Shinnosuke Horiuchi, Keisuke Umakoshi, and co&#8208;workers. Reversible multipoint coordination in the cluster core can endow them a remarkable stability, allowing separation of enantiomers and detection of chiroptical properties of the sandwich complexes in solution.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced process analytics are becoming an increasingly important part of continuous flow chemistry. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016007), Jason D. Williams, C. Oliver Kappe and co&#8208;workers describe the use of four different process analytical technologies, controlled by one central system, in a multistep continuous flow process. Advanced data processing methods, including artificial intelligence, are used to accurately quantify up to nine process species in real time, toward self&#8208;optimization and model predictive control applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Nx in low&#8208;spin state is the active site in the homolytic cleavage of H2O2 to .OH, as reported by Wenting Wu, Mingbo Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016888). Fe/Fe3C promotes the formation of Fe&#8208;Nx sites for this homolytic cleavages process, enabling the highly selective CH4 oxidation to HCOOH under light irradiation.

         <title>(Aza)Pentacenes Clipped into a Ring: Stabilization of Large (Aza)Acenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of large (aza)acenes is a necessary challenge to unlock their full potential. &#8220;Clipping&#8221; an azaacene into a large ring complements stabilization by trialkylsilylalkynylation as demonstrated by Jan Freudenberg, Uwe&#8197;H.&#8197;F. Bunz and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015348). &#8220;Jacketed&#8221; azapentacenes display superior photochemical and oxidative stability compared to their bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituted congeners.

         <title>Unified Approach to Furan Natural Products via Phosphine&#8208;Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly substituted polyalkyl furans can be synthesized using sequential Michael&#8211;Heck reactions between functionalized (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;halo allylic alcohols and activated alkynes. This method provides facile access to tetraalkyl furans containing a C2&#8208;carboxyalkyl chain, which is readily functionalized to enable the total syntheses of several classes of bioactive furans, including furanoterpenes, polyketides, and furan fatty acids.







Abstract
Polyalkyl furans are widespread in nature, often performing important biological roles. Despite a plethora of methods for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans, the construction of tetraalkyl furans remains non&#8208;trivial. The prevalence of alkyl groups in bioactive furan natural products, combined with the desirable bioactivities of tetraalkyl furans, calls for a general synthetic protocol for polyalkyl furans. This paper describes a Michael&#8211;Heck approach, using sequential phosphine&#8208;palladium catalysis, for the preparation of various polyalkyl furans from readily available precursors. The versatility of this method is illustrated by the total syntheses of nine distinct polyalkylated furan natural products belonging to different classes, namely the furanoterpenes rosefuran, sesquirosefuran, and mikanifuran; the marine natural products plakorsins&#8197;A, B, and D and plakorsin&#8197;D methyl ester; and the furan fatty acids 3D5 and hydromumiamicin.

         <title>Chiral Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores by Self&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling of Cationic Helicenes with Amines/Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic dioxa[6]helicene oxidizes alkyl amines to enamines and further reacts in situ as an electrophile to form, in one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step cascades, fully delocalized mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original approach provides chiral cyanine&#8208;like chromophores that absorb up to the NIR and fluoresce alike, with intense NIR ECD (&#916;&#1013; up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1). DFT showcases the importance of conformers in the strong chiroptical response.







Abstract
In one pot, tertiary alkyl amines are oxidized to enamines by cationic dioxa[6]helicene, which further reacts as electrophile and oxidant to form mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original and convergent synthetic approach provides a strong extension of conjugation yielding chromophores that absorb intensively in far&#8208;red or NIR domains (&#955;max up to 791&#8197;nm) and fluoresce in the NIR as well (&#955;max up to 887&#8197;nm). Intense ECD properties around 790&#8197;nm with a |&#916;&#1013;| value up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are observed.

         <title>&#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221;: Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput in Vitro Screening of NAD(H) Dehydrogenases Using Bead Display and Flow Cytometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detection system was devised to screen dehydrogenase enzymes (DH) at ultrahigh in in vitro droplet compartments. An NAD(H) analogue and a DH DNA library were co&#8208;immobilised on beads. Water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets containing cell&#8208;free expression mix and substrate allow compartmentalised the protein production and catalysis. A fluorescent sensor of NAD(H) redox state was loaded onto beads, allowing bulk sorting of 2&#215;104 DH variants in a day by flow cytometry.







Abstract
NAD(H)&#8208;utiliing enzymes have been the subject of directed evolution campaigns to improve their function. To enable access to a larger swath of sequence space, we demonstrate the utility of a cell&#8208;free, ultrahigh&#8208;throughput directed evolution platform for dehydrogenases. Microbeads (1.5 million per sample) carrying both variant DNA and an immobilised analogue of NAD+ were compartmentalised in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets, together with cell&#8208;free expression mixture and enzyme substrate, resulting in the recording of the phenotype on each bead. The beads&#8217; phenotype could be read out and sorted for on a flow cytometer by using a highly sensitive fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor of the NAD+:NADH ratio. Integration of this &#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221; approach with our previously described Split &amp; Mix (SpliMLiB) method for generating large site&#8208;saturation libraries allowed straightforward screening of fully balanced site saturation libraries of formate dehydrogenase, with diversities of 2&#215;104. Based on modular design principles of synthetic biology NAD&#8208;display offers access to sophisticated in vitro selections, avoiding complex technology platforms.

         <title>An Area&#8208;Specific, International Community&#8208;Led Approach to Understanding and Addressing Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Issues within Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marginalisation can be experienced for many intersectional reasons including race, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and gender. This Essay sets out a field&#8208;specific approach to supporting equality, diversity, and inclusion in supramolecular chemistry as pioneered by an international network of Women In Supramolecular Chemistry (WISC). WISC aims to &#8220;call in&#8221; the community and to use qualitative approaches to set out a framework for addressing EDI.







Abstract
Diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI/EDI) are pressing issues in chemistry and the natural sciences. In this Essay we share how an area&#8208;specific approach is &#8220;calling in&#8221; the community so that it can act to address EDI issues, and support those who are marginalised. Women In Supramolecular Chemistry (WISC) is an international network that aims to support equality, diversity, and inclusion within supramolecular chemistry. WISC has taken a field&#8208;specific approach using qualitative research methods with scientists to identify the support that is needed and the problems the supramolecular community needs to address. Herein, we present survey data from the community which highlight the barriers that are faced by those who take career breaks for any reason, a common example is maternity leave, and the importance of mentoring to aid progression post&#8208;PhD. In conclusion, we set out an interdisciplinary and creative approach to addressing EDI issues within supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 photoreduction with Ni&#8208;ZrO2 as a catalyst under UV/Vis light was monitored by 13C&#8208;labeled mass chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy, and EXAFS. The interplay of bicarbonate reduction to CO over ZrO2 owing to charge separation by light with subsequent hydrogenation of CO over Ni heated from light enabled CO2 reduction to methane.

The reaction mechanism of CO2 photoreduction into methane was elucidated by time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ FTIR spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under 13CO2, H2, and UV/Vis light, 13CH4 was formed at a rate of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 using Ni (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%)&#8208;ZrO2 that was effective at 96&#8197;kPa. Under UV/Vis light irradiation, the 13CO2 exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO2, followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni0 sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni0, which was reversibly heated to 394&#8197;K owing to the heat converted from light. With D2O and H2, the H/D ratio in the formed methane agreed with reactant H/D ratio. This study paves the way for using first row transition metals for solar fuel generation using only UV/Vis light.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Acyclic &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides was developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Enhanced selectivity was realized for the catalytic KR process using cyclic tertiary amine as a base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides are valuable compounds in chemical, material and medicinal sciences, but their enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. A catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of such amides with selectivity factor(s) up to &gt;200 is developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. An enhanced selectivity for the catalytic KR process is realized using cyclic tertiary amine as base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models for the process are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating organelle&#8208;specific targeting and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation with DNA sensor technology, precise imaging of a specific enzyme in a chosen organelle (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus) was possible (see picture). The spatiotemporal control enabled imaging of enzyme translocation at subcellular resolution in response to oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Understanding of the functions of enzymes in diverse cellular processes is important, but the design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8197;1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxidative stress in live cells.

         <title>Cys&#8211;Cys and Cys&#8211;Lys Stapling of Unprotected Peptides Enabled by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling are reported. Efficient and selective stapling on non&#8208;protected peptides was observed, and post&#8208;stapling modification could be easily achieved using reactive esters or cycloaddition on the thioalkynes formed on the cysteine residue. One stapled peptide displayed both enhanced helicity and binding to the MDM2 protein.







Abstract
Easy access to a wide range of structurally diverse stapled peptides is crucial for the development of inhibitors of protein&#8208;protein interactions. Herein, we report bis&#8208;functional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling yielding structurally diverse thioalkyne linkers. This stapling method works with unprotected natural amino acid residues and does not require pre&#8208;functionalization or metal catalysis. The products are stable to purification and isolation. Post&#8208;stapling modification can be accessed via amidation of an activated ester, or via cycloaddition onto the formed thioalkyne group. Increased helicity and binding affinity to MDM2 was obtained for a i,i+7 stapled peptide.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Using an Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Molecular Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting a liquid&#8208;like assembly into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging has been used to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of nanoparticle surfactants at the water/oil interface by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state (see graph).







Abstract
With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network is denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. It is a challenge to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, since both jamming and vitrification lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Herein, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP surfactants at the water/oil interface using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. The AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior at densities at which they can move and rotate. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the smaller intermolecular separation distance arrests rotation, and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive Cyanation and Phosphonylation of Secondary Amides by Iridium and Chiral Thiourea Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been achieved by the combination of iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from bench&#8208;stable feedstocks.







Abstract
The combination of transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable and the thiourea catalyst can be recycled and reused.

The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from bench&#8208;stable feedstocks.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable and the thiourea catalyst can be recycled and reused.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stable Thermotropic 3D and 2D Double Gyroid Nanostructures with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm Feature Size from Scalable Sugar&#8211;Polyolefin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, provide highly ordered and exceptionally stable thermotropic hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL) and double gyroid (DG) nanostructured phases. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15 nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, undergo a series of irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transitions with increasing temperature to provide nanostructured phases in the sequence: lamellar (L), hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL), double gyroid (DG) and hexagonal cylindrical (C). The DG phase displays exceptional stability at ambient temperature and features two interpenetrating sugar domain networks having a sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm strut width and a lattice parameter, aDG, of 13.1&#8197;nm. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further within ultrathin films all the way down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15&#8197;nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG. In addition to raising the fundamental question of what minimally constitutes a Schoen triply periodic minimal surface and DG lattice, these results serve to establish the class of sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugates as a new material platform for nanoscience and nanotechnology.

         <title>Quantifying the Likelihood of Structural Models through a Dynamically Enhanced Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally characterizing new and poorly crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks is highly challenging. The dynamic protocol of this work overcomes this challenge through a systematic likelihood ordering based on intuitive heuristics and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. It succeeds in unambiguously identifying a material's atomic&#8208;level structure, accounting for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experiments.







Abstract
Structurally characterizing new materials is tremendously challenging, especially when single crystal structures are hardly available which is often the case for covalent organic frameworks. Yet, knowledge of the atomic structure is key to establish structure&#8208;function relations and enable functional material design. Herein, a new protocol is proposed to unambiguously predict the structure of poorly crystalline materials through a likelihood ordering based on the X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Key of the procedure is the broad set of structures generated from a limited number of building blocks and topologies, which is submitted to operando structural characterization. The dynamic averaging in the latter accounts for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experimental measurements, yielding unparalleled agreement with experimental powder XRD patterns. The proposed concept can hence unquestionably identify the structure of experimentally synthesized materials, a crucial step to design next generation functional materials.

         <title>Activation of Pyroptosis by Membrane&#8208;Anchoring AIE Photosensitizer Design: New Prospect for Photodynamic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane anchoring photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were designed for cancer cell ablation via photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis as a lytic and inflammatory form of cell death is a powerful tool to fight against cancer. However, pyroptosis is usually activated by chemotherapeutic drugs, which limits its anti&#8208;tumor applications due to drug resistance and severe side effects. Herein, we demonstrate that membrane targeting photosensitizers can induce pyroptosis for cancer cell ablation with noninvasiveness and low side effects. A series of membrane anchoring photosensitizers (TBD&#8208;R PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were prepared through conjugation of TBD and phenyl ring with cationic chains. Upon light irradiation, cytotoxic ROS were produced in situ, resulting in direct membrane damage and superior cancer cell ablation. Detailed study revealed that pyroptosis gradually became the dominant cell death pathway along with the increase of TBD&#8208;R PSs membrane anchoring capability. This study offers a photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis&#8208;based intervention strategy for cancer cell ablation.

         <title>Enhanced Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production by Self&#8208;Photosensitized Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel biohybrid systems are created for light&#8208;driven H2 production by using non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms self&#8208;photosensitized with CdS nanoparticles. An outstanding biohybrid system using D. desulfuricans displays high H2 production activity, high stability and a remarkable solar efficiency.







Abstract
Storage of solar energy as hydrogen provides a platform towards decarbonizing our economy. One emerging strategy for the production of solar fuels is to use photocatalytic biohybrid systems that combine the high catalytic activity of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms with the high light&#8208;harvesting efficiency of metal semiconductor nanoparticles. However, few such systems have been tested for H2 production. We investigated light&#8208;driven H2 production by three novel organisms, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Citrobacter freundii, and Shewanella oneidensis, self&#8208;photosensitized with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, and compared their performance to Escherichia coli. All biohybrid systems produced H2 from light, with D. desulfuricans&#8208;CdS demonstrating the best activity overall and outperforming the other microbial systems even in the absence of a mediator. With this system, H2 was continuously produced for more than 10&#8197;days with a specific rate of 36&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gdcw&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. High apparent quantum yields of 23&#8201;% and 4&#8201;% were obtained, with and without methyl viologen, respectively, exceeding values previously reported.

All biohybrid systems produced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from light, with &lt;i&gt;D. desulfuricans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;CdS demonstrating the best activity overall and outperforming the other microbial systems even in the absence of a mediator. With this system, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was continuously produced for more than 10&#8197;days with a specific rate of 36&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;dcw&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. High apparent quantum yields of 23&#8201;% and 4&#8201;% were obtained, with and without methyl viologen, respectively, exceeding values previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;sorting of Giant Cubic [8+12] Salicylimine Cage Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective chiral self&#8208;sorting. The chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds was investigated, revealing a high selectivity for the most symmetric cage compounds, for which an explanation is presented. The properties of the isolated enantiopure and meso cage compounds were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas sorption measurements showing high porosities and selectivities.







Abstract
Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a meso cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of din=3.3&#8211;3.5&#8197;nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 after desolvation.

         <title>A Facile Synthesized Polymer Featuring B&#8208;N Covalent Bond and Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Gap for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily synthesized building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond were synthesized for application in solar cells. The polymer offered a power conversion efficiency of 16.1&#8201;%, a nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV, and a singlet&#8208;triplet gap as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, demonstrating the promising prospect of B&#8208;N&#8208;containing materials in organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) largely rely on polymer donors. Herein, we report a new building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond for application in OSCs. The BNT unit is synthesized in only 3 steps, leading to the facile synthesis of PBNT&#8208;BDD. When blended with a nonfullerene acceptor Y6&#8208;BO, PBNT&#8208;BDD afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.1&#8201;% in an OSC, comparable to the benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (BDT)&#8208;based counterpart. The nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV was afforded by PBNT&#8208;BDD. PBNT&#8208;BDD also exhibited weak crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6&#8208;BO, benefitting of morphological stability. The singlet&#8211;triplet gap (&#916;EST) of PBNT&#8208;BDD is as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of common organic semiconductors (&#8805;0.6&#8197;eV). As a result, the triplet state of PBNT&#8208;BDD is higher than the charge transfer (CT) state, which would suppress the recombination via triplet state effectively.

         <title>Linking dynamic chemical state of catalysts with product profile of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct electrochemical reduction of CO  2  (CO  2  RR) is a promising route to capture CO  2  waste and store renewable  electricity to generate chemical energy in fuels and feedstocks.  Nowadays, in most studies, the promoted activity and enhanced selectivity of various electrocatalysts are commonly ascribed to their specific structural features present in metallic form, such as surface facet, morphology, and atomic defects.  However, unraveling the factors that really govern CO  2  RR still faces great challenges due to a fact that the surface state of electrocatalysts is dynamic and challenging to predict under working conditions.  Moreover, it has to note that,  in a variety of studies  , the theoretical predictions from a viewpoint of thermodynamics only may fail to precisely state the actual configuration of a catalyst for the dynamic CO  2  RR process, resulting in numerous inappropriate claims  .  Herein,  we  re&#8208;survey recent studies  with the emphasis on revealing the dynamic chemical state of Cu sites under CO  2  RR conditions extracted by in situ/operando characterizations, and  further validate a critical link between  the chemical state of Cu and product profile of CO  2  RR.  The Cu catalyst surface with a mixed valence of Cu  +  and Cu  0  substantially manifests  a high selectivity for C&#8208;C coupling toward ethylene/ethanol, while the oxidized Cu  +  &#8208; and metallic Cu  0  &#8208;dominated surface promote the selective production of CO/formic acid and methane, respectively, suggesting the promising potential of dynamic Cu chemical state as a direct and precise descriptor for CO  2  RR selectivity on Cu electrodes. This point of view provides a generalizable concept of dynamic chemical state&#8208;driven CO  2  RR selectivity that has  been  disregarded  in the community and offers an inspiration in both fundamental understanding and efficient electrocatalysts design.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Subcellular Mass Spectrometry Enables Proteo&#8208;Metabolomic Single&#8208;cell Systems Biology in a Chordate Embryo Developing to a Normally Behaving Tadpole (X. laevis)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of  in vivo  subcellular high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for proteo&#8208;metabolomic molecular systems biology in complex tissues. With light microscopy, we identified the left&#8208;dorsal and left&#8208;ventral animal cells in cleavage&#8208;stage non&#8208;sentient  Xenopus laevis  embryos. Using precision&#8208;translated fabricated microcapillaries, the subcellular content of each cell was double&#8208;probed, each time swiftly (&lt;5 s/event) aspirating &lt;5% of cell volume (~10 nL). The proteins and metabolites were analyzed by home&#8208;built ultrasensitive capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization employing Orbitrap or time&#8208;of&#8208;flight HRMS. Label&#8208;free detection of ~150 metabolites (57 identified) and 738 proteins found proteo&#8208;metabolomic networks with differential quantitative activities between the cell types. With spatially and temporally scalable sampling, the technology preserved the integrity of the analyzed cells, the neighboring cells, and the embryo. 95% of the analyzed embryos developed into sentient tadpoles that were indistinguishable from their wild&#8208;type siblings based on anatomy and visual function in a background color preference assay.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since [Sn  8  ]  6&#8208;  was discovered from the solid&#8208;state phase in 2000, its solution chemistry has been elusive due to the high charges and chemical activity. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer {[K  2  ZnSn  8  (ZnMes)]  2  }  4&#8208;  (  1a  ), in which the highly charged [Sn  8  ]  6&#8208;  is captured by mixed&#8208;valence Zn  I  /Zn  II  to form the dimer {  closo  &#8208;[Zn  2  Sn  8  ]}  2  moieties bridged by a Zn&#8208;Zn bond. Such Zn&#8208;Sn cluster not only exhibits a novel example of mixed&#8208;valence Zn  I  /Zn  II  for stabilizing highly active anion species, but also indicates the [Sn  8  ] cluster can act as a novel bridging ligand, like arene, with a  &#951;  4  :  &#951;  4  &#8208;fashion. Theoretical calculations indicate that a significant delocalization of electrons over Zn atoms plays a vital role in the stabilization of the [Sn  8  ]  6&#8208;  species. The AdNDP and magnetic response analyses clearly showed the presence of local &#963;&#8208;aromaticity in three cluster fragments: two ZnSn  4  caps and Sn  8  square antiprism.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer {[K  2  ZnSn  8  (ZnMes)]  2  }  4&#8208;  (  1a  ), in which the highly charged [Sn  8  ]  6&#8208;  is captured by mixed&#8208;valence Zn  I  /Zn  II  to form the dimer {  closo  &#8208;[Zn  2  Sn  8  ]}  2  moieties bridged by a Zn&#8208;Zn bond. Such Zn&#8208;Sn cluster not only exhibits a novel example of mixed&#8208;valence Zn  I  /Zn  II  for stabilizing highly active anion species, but also indicates the [Sn  8  ] cluster can act as a novel bridging ligand, like arene, with a  &#951;  4  :  &#951;  4  &#8208;fashion. Theoretical calculations indicate that a significant delocalization of electrons over Zn atoms plays a vital role in the stabilization of the [Sn  8  ]  6&#8208;  species. The AdNDP and magnetic response analyses clearly showed the presence of local &#963;&#8208;aromaticity in three cluster fragments: two ZnSn  4  caps and Sn  8  square antiprism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Quality Control Assay for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries of Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is considerable interest in the development of libraries of scaffold&#8208;diverse macrocycles as a source of ligands for difficult targets, such as protein&#8208;protein interaction surfaces. A classic problem in the synthesis of high&#8208;quality macrocyclic libraries is that some linear precursors will cyclize efficiently while some will not, depending on their conformational preferences. We report here a powerful quality control method that can be employed to readily distinguish between scaffolds that do and do not cyclize efficiently during solid&#8208;phase synthesis of thioether macrocycles without the need for tedious liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. We demonstrate that this assay can be employed to identify largely linear &#8220;impurities&#8221; in a DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocycles. We also use the method to establish a useful quality control protocol for re&#8208;synthesis of putative macrocyclic screening hits.</dc:description>

         <title>Biased Symmetry Breaking and Chiral Control by Self&#8208;replicating in Achiral Tetradentate Platinum (II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of the supramolecular homochiral system composed of achiral components is helpful for us to understand the homochirality in the biosystem and develop potential chiroptical materials. However, obtaining homochirality from biased symmetry breaking of self&#8208;assembly in achiral molecules remains a great challenge due to the lack of ingenious strategies, not to mention controlling their handedness. Here, we report the first case of biased symmetry breaking from achiral platinum (II) liquid crystals which self&#8208;organize into an enantiomerically enriched single domain without selection of handedness in twist grain boundary TGB  [  *  ]  phase. Most importantly, the chiral control of self&#8208;organisation can be achieved by using above the homochiral liquid crystal films with determined handedness (P or M) as a template. Moreover, benefiting from self&#8208;assembled superhelix, these complexes exhibit prominent circularly polarized luminescence with high |glum| up to 3.4&#215;10  &#8208;3  in the TGB  [  *  ]  mesophase. This work paves a neoteric avenue for the development of chiral self&#8208;assemblies from achiral molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Plant Serotonin N&#8208;Acetyltransferase Reveal an Acid/Base&#8208;Assisted Catalysis in Melatonin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serotonin  N  &#8208;acetyltransferase (SNAT) is the key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis. SNAT mediates dual pathways of melatonin biosynthesis in plants by using serotonin and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine (5&#8208;MT) as substrates, and a high reaction pH and temperature are essential to its activity. However, little is known of its underlying mechanisms. Herein, we present a detailed reaction mechanism of a SNAT from  Oryza sativa  through combined structural and molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. We report for the first time the crystal structures of plant SNAT in the apo and binary/ternary complex forms with acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA), serotonin, and 5&#8208;MT. These structures reveal that  Os  SNAT exhibits a unique enzymatically active dimeric fold that is not found in all the known structures of arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase (AANAT) family. The key residues W188, D189, D226, N220, and Y233 located around the active pocket have important role in catalysis which is subsequently confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. Combined with MD simulations, we hypothesize a novel plausible catalytic mechanism in which D226 and Y233 function as catalytic base and acid during the acetyl&#8208;transfer reaction. This work provides a molecular framework for understanding the catalytic mechanisms of plant SNAT and has implications for future protein engineering and biocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Flexible Amine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by Catalysis &amp; Reduction of Formic Acid via Eschweiler&#8208;Clarke Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the current mainstream rigid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by imine bonds, flexible COFs have certain advantages of elasticity and self&#8208;adaptability, but their construction and application are greatly limited by the complexity in synthesis and difficulty in obtaining regular structure. Herein, we reported for the first time a series of flexible amine&#8208;linked COFs with high crystallinity synthesized by formic acid with unique catalytic and reductive bifunctional properties, rather than acetic acid, the most common catalyst for COF synthesis. The reaction mechanism was demonstrated to be a synchronous in&#8208;situ reduction during the formation of imine bond. The flexibilities of the products endow them with accommodative adaptability to guest molecules, thus increasing the adsorption capacities for nitrogen and iodine by 27% and 22%, respectively. Impressively, a novel concept of flexibility degree was proposed firstly, which provides an effective approach to rationally measure the flexibility of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biogenesis&#8208;Guided Synthesis and Structural Revision of Sarocladione Enabled by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Endoperoxide Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sarocladione is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid with a 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diketone framework to have been isolated from a natural source. Herein we report a biomimetic synthesis of sarocladione in only two or seven steps from inexpensive, commercially available ergosterol. The key feature of this synthesis was a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed various saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by cleavage of two C&#8211;C bonds. This synthesis allowed us to unambiguously determine the structure of sarocladione and provided experimental support for the revised biosynthetic origin of sarocladione. This work also vividly demonstrates that consideration of the biogenesis is a powerful tool for elucidating the structures of natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Feedback Lifecycles Programmed by Enzymatic Logic Gates Using Common Foods as Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial temporal signaling systems, which mimic living out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions, have achieved tremendous progress in design and preliminary autonomous materials applications. Nevertheless, artificial systems programmed by enzymatic reaction networks in multicomponent and unknown environments, and using biocompatible components remain a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to program temporal pH signals by orchestrating a tandem of a lag&#8208;free YES gate and an enzymatic NAND gate. The NAND gate is realized by an enzymatic disaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;monosaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;sugar acid reaction cascade catalyzed by two metabolic chains: invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase, respectively. Lifetimes of the transient pH signal can be programmed from less than 15 min to more than 1 day. We study enzymatic kinetics of the reaction cascades and reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms. By operating with all&#8208;food grade chemicals and coupling to self&#8208;regulating hydrogel, we showcase that our system is quite robust to work in a complicated medium with unknown components and in a biocompatible fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Electron Diffraction Reveals a Hidden Novel Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are known for their versatile combination of inorganic building units and organic linkers, which offers immense opportunities in a wide range of applications. However, many MOFs are typically synthesized as multiphasic polycrystalline powders, which are challenging for studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Therefore, developing new structural characterization techniques is highly desired in order to accelerate discoveries of new materials. Here, we report a high&#8208;throughput approach for structural analysis of MOF nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;microcrystals by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED). A new zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (ZIF),&#160;denoted ZIF&#8208;EC1, was first discovered in a trace amount during the study of a known ZIF&#8208;CO  3  &#8208;1 material by 3DED. The structures of both ZIFs were solved and refined using 3DED data. ZIF&#8208;EC1 has a dense 3D framework structure, which is built by linking mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;nuclear Zn clusters and 2&#8208;methylimidazolates (mIm  &#8208;  ). With a composition of Zn  3  (mIm)  5  (OH), ZIF&#8208;EC1 exhibits high N and Zn densities. We show that the N&#8208;doped carbon material derived from ZIF&#8208;EC1 is a promising electrocatalysis for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The discovery of this new MOF and its conversion to an efficient electrocatalyst highlights the power of 3DED in developing new materials and their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible supra&#8208;folding of user&#8208;programmed functional DNA nanostructures on fuzzy cationic substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that user&#8208;defined DNA nanostructures, such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) origamis and nanogrids, undergo a rapid higher&#8208;order folding transition, referred to as supra&#8208;folding, into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) compact structures (origamis) or well&#8208;defined &#181;m&#8208;long ribbons (nanogrids), when they adsorb on a soft cationic substrate prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. Once supra&#8208;folded, origamis can be switched back on the surface into their 2D original shape through addition of heparin, a highly charged anionic polyelectrolyte known as an efficient competitor of DNA&#8208;polyelectrolyte complexation. Orthogonal to DNA base&#8208;pairing principles, this reversible structural reconfiguration is also versatile; we show in particular that i) it is compatible with various origami shapes, ii) it perfectly preserves fine structural details as well as site&#8208;specific functionality, and iii) it can be applied to dynamically address the spatial distribution of origami&#8208;tethered proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>A simple biomimetic receptor selectively recognizing the GlcNAc2 disaccharide in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>GlcNAc2 is the core disaccharide fragment present in N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses of high health concern, such as coronaviruses. Because N&#8208;glycans are directly involved in the docking of viruses to host cells, recognition of GlcNAc2 by a biomimetic receptor may be a convenient alternative to the use of lectins to interfere with viral entry and infection. Herein we describe a simple biomimetic receptor recognizing the methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycoside of GlcNAc2 in water with an unprecedented affinity of 160 &#181;M, exceeding that of more structurally complex receptors reported in the literature. The tweezers&#8208;shaped acyclic structure exhibits marked selectivity among structurally related disaccharides, and complete discrimination between mono&#8208; and disaccharides. Molecular modelling calculations supported by NOE data provided a three&#8208;dimensional description of the binding mode, shedding light on the origin of the affinities and selectivities exhibited by the receptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Regulation of Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Couplings between Indazoles and Isoprene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent coupling reactions between indazoles and isoprene have been developed through the orthogonal regulation of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites.







Abstract
Depending on the reactant property and reaction mechanism, one major regioisomer can be favored in a reaction that involves multiple active sites. Herein, an orthogonal regulation of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in the regiodivergent hydroamination of isoprene with indazoles is demonstrated. Under Pd&#8208;hydride catalysis, the 1,2&#8208; or 4,3&#8208;insertion pathway with respect to the electrophilic sites on isoprene could be controlled by the choice of ligands. In terms of the nucleophilic sites on indazoles, the reaction occurs at either the N1&#8208; or N2&#8208;position of indazoles is governed by the acid co&#8208;catalysts. Preliminary experimental studies have been performed to rationalize the mechanism and regioselectivity. This study not only contributes a practical tool for selective functionalization of isoprene, but also provides a guide to manipulate the regioselectivity for the N&#8208;functionalization of indazoles.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Directed C&#8722;H Borylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient metal&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyrroles by using only BBr3 directed by pivaloyl groups. The site&#8208;selectivity is generally dominated by chelation and electronic effects, thus forming diverse C2&#8208;borylated pyrroles against the steric effect.







Abstract
Robust strategies to enable the rapid construction of complex organoboronates in selective, practical, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly modes remain conspicuously underdeveloped. Here, we develop a general strategy for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyrroles by using only BBr3 directed by pivaloyl groups, avoiding the use of any metal. The site&#8208;selectivity is generally dominated by chelation and electronic effects, thus forming diverse C2&#8208;borylated pyrroles against the steric effect. The formed products can readily engage in downstream transformations, enabling a step&#8208;economic process to access drugs such as Lipitor. DFT calculations (wB97X&#8208;D) demonstrate the preferred positional selectivity of this reaction.

     alt="Metal&#8208;Free Directed C&#8722;H Borylation of Pyrroles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient metal&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyrroles by using only BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; directed by pivaloyl groups. The site&#8208;selectivity is generally dominated by chelation and electronic effects, thus forming diverse C2&#8208;borylated pyrroles against the steric effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust strategies to enable the rapid construction of complex organoboronates in selective, practical, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly modes remain conspicuously underdeveloped. Here, we develop a general strategy for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyrroles by using only BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; directed by pivaloyl groups, avoiding the use of any metal. The site&#8208;selectivity is generally dominated by chelation and electronic effects, thus forming diverse C2&#8208;borylated pyrroles against the steric effect. The formed products can readily engage in downstream transformations, enabling a step&#8208;economic process to access drugs such as Lipitor. DFT calculations (wB97X&#8208;D) demonstrate the preferred positional selectivity of this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction Over Ultrathin Metallic Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a tough task to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst is designed to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Among the reported single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is realized by Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets.







Abstract
Converting CO2 and H2O into carbon&#8208;based fuel by IR light is a tough task. Herein, compared with other single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is achieved by an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst&#8208;Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets (Ni&#8208;CoS2). The evolution rate of CH4 over Ni&#8208;CoS2 is up to 101.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The metallic and ultrathin nature endow Ni&#8208;CoS2 with excellent IR light absorption ability. The PL spectra and Arrhenius plots indicate that Ni atoms could facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers and the decrease of the activation energy. Moreover, in situ FTIR, DFT calculations, and CH4&#8208;TPD reveal that the doped Ni atoms in CoS2 could effectively depress the formation energy of the *COOH, *CHO and desorption energy of CH4. This work manifests that element doping in atomic level is a powerful way to control the reaction intermediates, providing possibilities to realize high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Missing Linker Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral and hexahedral coordination cages with one or two missing linkers, as well as regular trigonal prismatic cages, are controlled synthesized by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of lanthanide(III) ions. The defective cages, especially the hexahedral cage is conformational flexible and adapt its structure to accommodate various guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals that are not accessible to the non&#8208;defective cage.







Abstract
We present here the controlled synthesis of defective coordination cages by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of the assembled metal ions. Three chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derived bis&#8208;tridentate ligands L1&#8211;L3 with pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamides (pcam) chelating moieties are therefore designed and synthesized, among which L3 has a smaller steric hindrance on the coordinating sites relative to the other two linkers. Complexes of L1 and L2 with lanthanides afford the irregular Ln8(L1)10 hexahedra with two missing edges and Ln4(L2)5 tetrahedra with one missing edge, respectively, both of which contain a 1:1 mixture of Ln(pcam)2 and Ln(pcam)3. In contrast, complex of L3 produces the regular twisted Ln6(L3)9 trigonal prisms without missing edges that contain only Ln(pcam)3 vertices. The defective cage has more freedom to adjust its structural conformation, affording adaptable cavity to accommodate a range of guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals.

         <title>Genome&#8208;Mining&#8208;Based Discovery of the Cyclic Peptide Tolypamide and TolF, a Ser/Thr Forward O&#8208;Prenyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TolF is a novel O&#8208;prenyltransferase which catalyzes forward O&#8208;prenylation on threonine and serine residues. A combination of genome mining, natural product chemistry, and biochemical assays were used to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster and natural product, and to functionally validate the enzyme. This study fills a gap in the sequence&#8208;function space of prenyltransferases and introduces TolF as a promising tool in synthetic biology.







Abstract
Cyanobactins comprise a widespread group of peptide metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that are often diversified by post&#8208;translational prenylation. Several enzymes have been identified in cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways that carry out chemically diverse prenylation reactions, representing a resource for the discovery of post&#8208;translational alkylating agents. Here, genome mining was used to identify orphan cyanobactin prenyltransferases, leading to the isolation of tolypamide from the freshwater cyanobacterium Tolypothrix sp. The structure of tolypamide was confirmed by spectroscopic methods, degradation, and enzymatic total synthesis. Tolypamide is forward&#8208;prenylated on a threonine residue, representing an unprecedented post&#8208;translational modification. Biochemical characterization of the cognate enzyme TolF revealed a prenyltransferase with strict selectivity for forward O&#8208;prenylation of serine or threonine but with relaxed substrate selectivity for flanking peptide sequences. Since cyanobactin pathways often exhibit exceptionally broad substrate tolerance, these enzymes represent robust tools for synthetic biology.

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative desaturation&#8208;triggered cascade reaction of &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones with primary amines has been developed to rapidly construct structurally &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams. An intramolecular 1,2&#8208;(hetero)aryl migration is induced by amide C&#8722;N bond formation, providing the products in generally good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields across a broad substrate scope with respect to both coupling partners.







Abstract
Rearrangement reactions incorporated into cascade reactions play an important role in rapidly increasing molecular complexity from readily available starting materials. Reported here is a Cu&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones with primary amines that incorporates an unusual 1,2&#8208;aryl migration induced by amide C&#8722;N bond formation to produce a class of structurally novel &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams in generally good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. This cascade reaction has a broad substrate scope with respect to primary amines, allows a wide spectrum of (hetero)aryl groups to smoothly undergo 1,2&#8208;migration, and tolerates electronically diverse &#945;&#8208;substituents on the (hetero)aryl ring of the ketones. Mechanistically, this 1,2&#8208;aryl migration may stem from the intramolecular amide C&#8722;N bond formation which induces nucleophilic migration of the aryl group from the acyl carbon center to the electrophilic carbon center that is conjugated with the resulting iminium moiety.

Mechanistically, this 1,2&#8208;aryl migration may stem from the intramolecular amide C&#8722;N bond formation which induces nucleophilic migration of the aryl group from the acyl carbon center to the electrophilic carbon center that is conjugated with the resulting iminium moiety.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Ketones by C&#8722;H Functionalization of Aldehydes with Boronic Acids under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrosobenzene can simultaneously activate the C&#8722;H bonds of aldehydes and the C&#8722;B bonds of boronic acids triggering a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming process that leads to the synthesis of ketones via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free practical, scalable, and operationally easy method for the synthesis of ketones.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and boronic acids via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization reaction is reported. The method employs nitrosobenzene as a reagent to drive the simultaneous activation of the boronic acid as a boronate and the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of the aldehyde as an iminium species that triggers the key C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming step via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of ketones.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalysed Hydroarylation of Highly Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroarylation is an effective strategy to rapidly increase the complexity of organic structures by transforming flat alkene moieties into 3D frameworks. A new method is reported for the selective hydroheteroarylation of multiply substituted styrenes and heteroaromatic styrenes to give multiple ring&#8208;substituted products. Mechanistic exploration revealed that commercially available terthiophene is central to the reactivity of this novel catalytic system.







Abstract
Hydroarylation is an effective strategy to rapidly increase the complexity of organic structures by transforming flat alkene moieties into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the hydroarylation of styrenes, however most of these reports examine the hydroarylation of unpolar, &#946;&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted styrenes, while exploring mainly electron&#8208;rich benzene nucleophiles. Herein, we report a mild and general catalytic system for the selective hydroheteroarylation of multiply substituted styrenes and heteroaromatic styrenes. Mechanistic analysis of the reaction led to the discovery of commercially available 2,2&#8242;:5&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terthiophene as a key reagent.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Water Stable Uranyl(V) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tridentate dipicolinate ligand dpa2&#8722;, allowed to stabilize and isolate mononuclear and trinuclear uranyl(V) species in anoxic basic water providing the second example ever isolated of a water stable uranyl(V) and further demonstrating the environmental relevance of UV. The uranyl(VI), uranyl(V) and UIV dipicolinate complexes show very different measurable luminescent spectra characteristic of the uranium oxidation state.







Abstract
The importance of uranyl(V) (UO2+) species associated with environmental and geologic applications is becoming increasingly evident, but the tendency of the uranyl(V) cation to disproportionate in water has prevented the isolation of stable complexes. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of the tridentate complexing dipicolinate (dpa2&#8722;), a ligand highly abundant in soil, the uranyl(V) species can be stabilized and isolated in anoxic basic water. Stable uranyl(V) dipicolinate complexes are readily formed from the reduction of the uranyl(VI) analogue both in organic solution and in basic water, and their solution and solid&#8208;state structure were determined. A bis&#8208;dpa UVO2+ complex was obtained from water at pH&#8197;10, while at higher pH values, a trinuclear mono&#8208;dpa cation&#8208;cation complex was isolated. These results present the second ever isolated water stable uranyl(V) complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that dipicolinate complexes of UVIO22+, UVO2+ and UIV are strongly luminescent with a signature characteristic of each oxidation state. This provides unique examples of luminescent UV and UIV compounds.

         <title>The Atypical Hysteresis of [Fe(C6F5Tp)2]: Overlay of Spin&#8208;Crossovers and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] complex is converted through melting from a crystal phase showing a very gradual spin&#8208;crossover to another one showing a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition. The uncommon &#8220;rounded&#8221; hysteresis occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system. It is due to a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that is triggered when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.







Abstract
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviours: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of ca. 65&#8197;K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated with a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occur in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated with the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.

         <title>Responsive Emulsions for Sequential Multienzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2, pH, and thermo&#8208;responsive emulsion was developed to perform multienzyme cascades without incompatibility and cross&#8208;reactivity issues. This emulsion allows the on&#8208;demand control of morphology and phase composition, and therefore exchanging enzymes and separate yielding/recycling of products and polymers. A three&#8208;enzyme cascade was performed sequentially, each step was carried out under the optimal conditions of the corresponding enzyme.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascade biocatalysis is an efficient synthetic process, avoiding the isolation/purification of intermediates and shifting the reaction equilibrium to the product side.. However, multienzyme systems are often limited by their incompatibility and cross&#8208;reactivity. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;responsive emulsion to proceed multienzyme reactions sequentially for high reactivity. The emulsion is achieved using a CO2, pH, and thermo&#8208;responsive block copolymer as a stabilizer, allowing the on&#8208;demand control of emulsion morphology and phase composition. Applying this system to a three&#8208;step cascade reaction enables the individual optimal condition for each enzyme, and a high overall conversion (ca. 97&#8201;% of the calculated limit) is thereby obtained. Moreover, the multi&#8208;responsiveness of the emulsion allows the facile and separate yielding/recycling of products, polymers and active enzymes. Besides, the system could be scaled up with a good yield.

         <title>Cascaded Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Towards Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Lasers Beyond 850&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;level energy systems are constructed through the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer consisting of a first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and a following dominant and irreversible proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, which support the NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm for exploiting energy&#8208;level systems of OSSLs, especially at the NIR region from 780 to 2500&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic solid&#8208;state lasers play an essential role in applications ranging from laser communication to infrared night vision, but progress in this area is restricted by the lack of effective excited&#8208;state gain processes. Herein, we originally proposed and demonstrated the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer for constructing the completely new energy&#8208;level systems. Cascading by the first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and the subsequent irreversible second proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, the stepwise proton transfer process favors the true six&#8208;level photophysical cycle, which supports efficient population inversion and thus NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm. This work realizes longest wavelength beyond 850&#8197;nm of organic single&#8208;crystal lasing to date and originally exploits the cascaded excited&#8208;state molecular proton transfer energy&#8208;level systems for organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Surface Modification of Black Phosphorus with Group 13 Lewis Acids for Ambient Protection and Electronic Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A match made for black P: Modifying black P with chemically&#8208;matched Lewis acids imparts remarkable ambient stability, excellent transport properties, and persistent p&#8208;doping. Compatible with device fabrication and relying on commercially available reagents, this facile protocol opens a path for deterministic and persistent tuning of electronic properties in black P.







Abstract
Herein we introduce a facile, solution&#8208;phase protocol to modify the Lewis basic surface of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (bP) and demonstrate its effectiveness at providing ambient stability and tuning of electronic properties. Commercially available group 13 Lewis acids that range in electrophilicity, steric bulk, and Pearson hard/soft&#8208;ness are evaluated. The nature of the interaction between the Lewis acids and the bP lattice is investigated using a range of microscopic (optical, atomic force, scanning electron) and spectroscopic (energy dispersive, X&#8208;ray photoelectron) methods. Al and Ga halides are most effective at preventing ambient degradation of bP (&gt;84&#8197;h for AlBr3), and the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors show excellent IV characteristics, photocurrent, and current stability, and are significantly p&#8208;doped. This protocol, chemically matched to bP and compatible with device fabrication, opens a path for deterministic and persistent tuning of the electronic properties in bP.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Tuning Electron Distribution of Single&#8208;Atomic Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single iron atom catalyst composed of atomically&#8208;dispersed iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped carbon matrix with an inverse opal structure is developed to accelerate nitrogen reduction reaction kinetics for efficient conversion of N2 into NH3.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays a vital role for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, the NRR kinetics is still limited by the sluggish hydrogenation process on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a hybrid catalyst with atomic iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C) matrix of an inverse opal structure, leading to a remarkably high NH3 yield rate of 31.9&#8197;&#956;g
&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and Faradaic efficiency of 11.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V for NRR electrocatalysis, outperformed almost all previously reported atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the observed high NRR catalytic activity for the FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C catalyst stemmed mainly from the optimized charge&#8208;transfer between the adjacent O and Fe atoms homogenously distributed on the porous carbon support, which could not only significantly facilitate the transportation of N2 and ions but also effectively decrease the binding energy between the isolated Fe atom and *N2 intermediate and the thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (*N2 &#8594; *NNH).

         <title>A Desaturase&#8208;Like Enzyme Catalyzes Oxazole Formation in Pseudomonas Indolyloxazole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolyloxazole alkaloids are widespread natural products with diverse bioactivities but previously unknown biosynthesis. Transposon mutagenesis, heterologous pathway expression, and labeling experiments provide evidence for a Pseudomonas pathway involving oxazole formation by cyclization as a new reaction type catalyzed by a desaturase&#8208;like enzyme.







Abstract
Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro&#8208; and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. Despite their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an N&#8208;acyltransferase and a non&#8208;heme diiron desaturase&#8208;like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable&#8208;isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.

         <title>(Aza)Acenes Share the C2 Bridge with (Anti)Aromatic Macrocycles: Local vs. Global Delocalization Paths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Global switch for local effect: The linear fusion of (aza)acene and a redox switchable macrocycle (i.e. triphyrin(2.1.1)) gives a set of fused systems merging two &#960;&#8208;conjugated clouds. A competition between local and global effects can be distinguished as documented in spectroscopic properties with a domination of (aza)acene diatropic current obtained after a redox switching within the macrocyclic flank.







Abstract
A strong conjugation present in fused systems plays a crucial role in tuning of the properties that would be showing a dependence on the efficiency of &#960;&#8208;electrons coupling. The &#960;&#8208;cloud available in the final structure can be drastically influenced by a side&#8208; or a linear fusion of unsaturated and conjugated hydrocarbons. The linear welding of naphthalene/anthracene or quinoxaline/benzo[g]quinoxaline with triphyrin(2.1.1) gives structures where the competition between local and global delocalization is distinguished. The aromatic character observed in skeletons strongly depends on the oxidation state of the macrocyclic flanking and is either extended over the whole system or kept as a composition of local currents (diatropic and paratropic) of incorporated units. The hybrid systems show the properties derived from the &#960;&#8208;conjugations that interlace one another but also show a significant independence of (aza)acene subunits reflected in the observed spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions of Alkynylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective cycloaddition of alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) promoted an earth&#8208;abundant metal is described. A chiral low&#8208;valent CoI complex generated in situ from a CoII precursor, catalyzes an intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition between ACPs and alkynes, to give fused bicyclic products in good yields and with excellent er values.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes equipped with chiral ligands can efficiently promote highly enantioselective (3+2) cycloadditions of alkyne&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes. The annulation allows to assemble bicyclic systems containing five&#8208;membered rings in good yields and with excellent enantiomeric ratios. We also present a mechanistic discussion based on experimental and computational data, which support the involvement of CoI/CoIII catalytic cycles.

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanism of Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation and growth behavior of anion&#8208;derived SEI on graphite electrode is revealed, the number of nucleation sites increases progressively, and each nucleus undergoes 2D growth before overlapping with others. Only when the whole electrode surface is completely covered by reduced products, an ion&#8208;conducting but electron&#8208;insulating polycrystalline film forms, which marks the end of SEI growth.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been widely employed to describe the new phase formed between anode and electrolyte in working batteries. Significant advances have been achieved on the structure and composition of SEI as well as on the possible ion transport mechanism. However, the nucleation and growth mechanism of SEI catches little attention, which requires the establishment of isothermal electrochemical crystallization theory. Herein we explore the virgin territory of electrochemically crystallized SEI. By using potentiostatic method to regulate the decomposition of anions, an anion&#8208;derived SEI forms on graphite surface at atomic scale. After fitting the cur&#8208;rent&#8208;time transients with Laviron theory and Avrami formula, we conclude that the formation of anion&#8208;derived interface is surface reaction controlled and obeys the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation and growth model. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images emphasize the conclusion, which reveals the mystery of isothermal electrochemical crystallization of SEI.

         <title>Photoactive Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Nanosegregated Donor&#8211;Acceptor Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the first mesogenic donor&#8208;acceptor polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based hybrid is presented. In the solid state, the compound displays a lamellar organization in which the sub&#8208;unit organizations are similar to that observed for the individual POM and organic donor precursors. The fluorescence of the donor is considerably quenched both in solution and in the solid state, which is attributed to the occurrence of charge transfer.







Abstract
The synthesis of the first mesogenic donor&#8208;acceptor polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based hybrid is herein described. The structural and electronic properties of the hybrid compound were evaluated through combination of small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, optical microscopy, electrochemistry and photoluminescence. In the solid state, the compound behaves as a birefringent solid, displaying a lamellar organization in which double&#8208;layers of POMs and bis(thiophene)thienothiophene organic donors alternate regularly. Noticeably, the sub&#8208;unit organizations in the composite are similar to that observed for the individual POM and organic donor precursors. Photophysical studies show that in the hybrid, the fluorescence of the organic donor unit is considerably quenched both in solution and in the solid state, which is attributed to occurrence of intramolecular charge&#8208;separated state.

         <title>Two Cryptic Self&#8208;Resistance Mechanisms in Streptomyces tenebrarius Reveal Insights into the Biosynthesis of Apramycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cryptic self&#8208;resistance mechanisms involving C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation were discovered in Streptomyces tenebrarius to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity during apramycin biosynthesis. Characterization of the corresponding enzymes revealed the apramycin's assembly line at the pseudotrisaccharide stage.







Abstract
Apramycin is a clinically promising aminoglycoside antibiotic (AGA). To date, mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis and self&#8208;resistance of apramycin remain largely unknown. Here we report that apramycin biosynthesis proceeds through unexpected phosphorylation, deacetylation, and dephosphorylation steps, in which a novel aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (AprU), a putative creatinine amidohydrolase (AprP), and an alkaline phosphatase (AprZ) are involved. Biochemical characterization revealed that AprU specifically phosphorylates 5&#8208;OH of a pseudotrisaccharide intermediate, whose N&#8208;7&#8242; acetyl group is subsequently hydrolyzed by AprP. AprZ is located extracellularly where it removes the phosphate group from a pseudotetrasaccharide intermediate, leading to the maturation of apramycin. Intriguingly, 7&#8242;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylated and 5&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated apramycin that were accumulated in &#916;aprU and &#916;aprZ respectively exhibited significantly reduced antibacterial activities, implying Streptomyces tenebrarius employs C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation as two strategies to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity. Significantly, this study provides insight into the design of new generation AGAs to circumvent the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Macrocyclic Arenes&#8208;Based Conjugated Macrocycle Polymers for Highly Selective CO2 Capture and Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four catcher&#8208;type conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) have been designed and synthesized successfully, exhibiting interesting application in CO2 and I2 uptake. The CMP&#8208;2 is able to capture CO2 with excellent selectivity and the CMP&#8208;4 is capable of adsorbing iodine with outstanding capacity.







Abstract
Incorporating synthetic macrocycles with unique structures and distinct conformations into conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMPs) can endow the resulting materials with great potentials in gas uptake and pollutant adsorption. Here, four CMPs (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) capable of reversibly capturing iodine and efficiently separating carbon dioxide are constructed from per&#8208;triflate functionalized leaning tower[6]arene (LT6&#8208;OTf) and [2]biphenyl&#8208;extended pillar[6]arene (BpP6&#8208;OTf) via Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Intriguingly, owing to the appropriate cavity size of LT6&#8208;OTf and the numerous aromatic rings in the framework, the newly designed CMP&#8208;4 possesses an outstanding I2 affinity with a large uptake capacity of 208&#8197;wt&#8201;% in vapor and a great removal efficiency of 94&#8201;% in aqueous solutions. To our surprise, with no capacity to accommodate nitrogen, CMP&#8208;2 constructed from BpP6&#8208;OTf is able to specifically capture carbon dioxide at ambient conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Four catcher&#8208;type conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMP&#8208;n, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1&#8211;4) have been designed and synthesized successfully, exhibiting interesting application in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake.

         <title>Are Amines the Holy Grail for Facilitating CO2 Reduction?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the last decade, several of the most significant breakthroughs in the homogeneous electrochemical, photochemical, and hydrogenation of carbon dioxide have been driven by the introduction of amines or amine&#8208;derived moieties in the reaction mixture. These amines play multiple roles, which are discussed herein to provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The selective and efficient reduction of carbon dioxide represents a key solution to producing non&#8208;fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;based feedstocks for the chemical industry, while alleviating the increasing atmospheric concentration of this greenhouse gas. A variety of catalytic methods for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) have been developed, including hydrogenations and electrochemical or photochemical reductions. For many of the most significant breakthroughs reported in the last decade, we realized that amines or closely related functional groups play a critical role for such transformations, and in several cases, are directly associated with the catalyst as a pendant group. Amines play multiple roles, such as CO2 trapping agents, proton shuttles, electron donors, or facilitators of CO2 reductions through formamide derivatives. In this Viewpoint, we compile some of these recent findings, and discuss their significance in a broader context in an attempt to provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Tagged Fragmented Ligand Installation for Covalent Modification of MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminosalicylic acid has been used as a functionalized fragment to generate an amine&#8208;tagged defect&#8208;engineered Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, which could be covalently modified post&#8208;synthetically to generate metal&#8208;binding sites. Subsequent metalation with PdII ions afforded PdII&#8208;incorporated Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, which is a highly efficient, size&#8208;selective, and recyclable catalyst for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
MOF&#8208;74 is one of the most explored metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), but its functionalization is limited to the dative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of the monodentate solvent site. Owing to the nature of the organic ligand and framework structure of MOF&#8208;74, the covalent PSM of MOF&#8208;74 is very demanding. Herein, we report, for the first time, the covalent PSM of amine&#8208;tagged defective Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, which is prepared by de&#8197;novo solvothermal synthesis by using aminosalicylic acid as a functionalized fragmented organic ligand. The covalent PSM of the amino group generates metal binding sites, and subsequent post&#8208;synthetic metalation with PdII ions affords the PdII&#8208;incorporated Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 catalyst. This catalyst exhibits highly efficient, size&#8208;selective, and recyclable catalytic activity for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. This strategy is also useful for the covalent modification of amine&#8208;tagged defective Ni2(DOBPDC), an expanded analogue of MOF&#8208;74.

         <title>Using the Mechanical Bond to Tune the Performance of a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the characterization of rotaxanes based on a carbazole&#8211;benzophenone thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminophore. We find that the mechanical bond leads to an improvement in key photophysical properties of the emitter, notably an increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and a decrease in the energy difference between singlet and triplet states, as well as fine tuning of the emission wavelength, a feat that is difficult to achieve when using covalently bound substituents. Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest that this tuning of properties occurs due to weak interactions between the axle and the macrocycle that are enforced by the mechanical bond . This work highlights the benefits of using the mechanical bond to refine existing luminophores, providing a new avenue for emitter optimization that can ultimately increase the performance of these molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>The unusual homodimer of a heme&#8208;copper terminal oxidase allows itself to utilize two electron donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heme&#8208;copper oxidase superfamily comprises cytochrome  c  and ubiquinol oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of electrons from different electron donors onto molecular oxygen. A B&#8208;family cytochrome  c  oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium  Aquifex aeolicus  was discovered previously to be able to use both cytochrome  c  and naphthoquinol as electron donors. Its molecular mechanism as well as the evolutionary significance are yet unknown.  Here we solved its 3.4 &#197; resolution electron cryo&#8208;microscopic structure and discovered a novel dimeric structure mediated by subunit I (CoxA2) that would be essential for naphthoquinol binding and oxidation. The unique structural features in both proton and oxygen pathways suggest an evolutionary adaptation of this oxidase to its hyperthermophilic environment. Our results add a new conceptual understanding of structural variation of cytochrome  c  oxidases in different species.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Ultrasound Contrast of Renal&#8208;Clearable Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles are typically fast eliminated through the free glomerular filtration, which show weak interaction with the renal compartments and negligible ultrasound signals, raising challenges in direct imaging of kidney diseases. Here, we report the ultrasmall&#160;renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with both pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and aggregation properties, and discover that enhanced ultrasound contrast could be facilely acquired through the increased tubular reabsorption and  in&#8208;situ  aggregation of AuNPs in renal tubule cells in injured kidneys. The tuning elimination pathway of the renal&#8208;clearable luminescent AuNPs is further demonstrated to provide a synergistical fluorescence and ultrasound imaging strategy for diagnosing early kidney injury with precise anatomical information.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Determination of Hydride Locations in Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the coordinates of the metal atoms can be accurately determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, locations of hydrides in metal nanoclusters are challenging to determine. In principle, neutron crystallography can be employed to pinpoint the hydride positions, but it requires a large crystal and a neutron source, which prevents its routine use. Here, we present a deep&#8208;learning approach that can accelerate determination of hydride locations in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of metal nanoclusters of different sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in predicting the most probable hydride sites and their combinations to determine the total structure for two recently reported copper nanoclusters, [Cu  25  H  10  (SPhCl  2  )  18  ]  3&#8208;  and [Cu  61  (S  t  Bu)  26  S  6  Cl  6  H  14  ]  +  whose hydride locations have not been determined by neutron diffraction. Our method can be generalized and applied to other metal systems, thereby eliminating a bottleneck in atomically precise metal&#8208;hydride nanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a single protein&#8208;chain reporter for opioid detection at a cellular resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mu&#8208;opioid receptor (MOR) signaling regulates multiple neuronal pathways, including those involved in pain, reward, and respiration. To advance the understanding of MOR&#8217;s roles in pain modulation, there is a need for high&#8208;throughput screening methods of opioids in vitro and high&#8208;resolution mapping of opioids in the brain. To fill this need, we designed and characterized a genetically&#8208;encoded fluorescent reporter, called  S  ingle&#8208;chain  P  rotein&#8208;based  O  pioid  T  ransmission  I  ndicator  T  ool for  M  OR (M&#8208;SPOTIT). M&#8208;SPOTIT represents a new and unique mechanism for fluorescent reporter design and can detect MOR activation, leaving a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. M&#8208;SPOTIT shows an opioid&#8208;dependent fluorescence turn&#8208;on up to 12.5&#8208;fold and is able to detect as fast as a 30&#8208;second&#160;opioid exposure in cell culture. Additionally, it showed an opioid&#8208;dependent fluorescence turn&#8208;on up to 4.2&#8208;fold in neuronal culture and can detect fentanyl with an EC  50  of 15 nM. M&#8208;SPOTIT will be useful for high&#8208;throughput detection of opioids in cell cultures and potentially a cellular&#8208;resolution detection of opioids in vivo. M&#8208;SPOTIT&#8217;s novel mechanism can be used as a platform to design other G&#8208;protein coupled receptor&#8208;based sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Cryo&#8208;EM Resolves Molecular Recognition Of An Optojasp Photoswitch Bound To Actin Filaments In Both Switch States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting actin requires spatiotemporal control of drug activity. Optojasps are photo&#8208;switchable small molecules, providing direct optical spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton. We present high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of both isomeric states of an optojasp bound to F&#8208;actin and describe in detail the binding pocket and conformational changes associated with switching of the azobenzene.







Abstract
Actin is essential for key processes in all eukaryotic cells. Cellpermeable optojasps provide spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton, confining toxicity and potentially rendering F&#8208;actin druggable by photopharmacology. Here, we report cryo electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structures of both isomeric states of one optojasp bound to actin filaments. The high&#8208;resolution structures reveal for the first time the pronounced effects of photoswitching a functionalized azobenzene. By characterizing the optojasp binding site and identifying conformational changes within F&#8208;actin that depend on the optojasp isomeric state, we refine determinants for the design of functional F&#8208;actin photoswitches.

         <dc:description>The separation of ethylene (C  2  H  4  ) from a mixture of ethane (C  2  H  6  ), ethylene (C  2  H  4  ), and acetylene (C  2  H  2  ) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable  ftw  topological Zr&#8208;MOF platform (  MOF&#8208;525  ). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw&#8208;type MOFs materials (  UPC&#8208;612  and  UPC&#8208;613  ), which increase the host&#8208;guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of  UPC&#8208;612  and  UPC&#8208;613  for C  2  H  2  /C  2  H  4  /C  2  H  6  separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one&#8208;step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function&#8208;oriented porous structures for such applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Disulfuration by a Chiral Bulky Lewis Trio</title>

         <dc:description>A Lewis trio involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C  6  F  5  )  3  and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effec&#8208;tive enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The bulky tertiary amine was found to activate a bulky primary&#8208;tertiary diamine&#8208;borane Lewis pair for enamine catalysis via &#8220;frustrated&#8221; interaction. The resulted chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls or &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Allylic C(sp3)&#8211;H and Vinylic C(sp2)&#8211;H Thiolation with Hydrogen Evolution by Quantum Dots and Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct allylic C&#8211;H thiolation is straightforward for allylic C(sp  3  )&#8211;S bond formation. However, strong interactions between thiol and transition metal catalysts lead to deactivation of the catalytic cycle or oxidation of sulfur atom under oxidative condition. Thus, direct allylic C(sp  3  )&#8211;H thiolation has proved difficult. Represented herein is an exceptional for direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic thiolation of allylic C(sp  3  )&#8211;H and thiol S&#8211;H under visible light irradiation. Radical trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy identified the allylic radical and thiyl radical generated on the surface of photocatalyst QDs. The C&#8211;S bond formation does not require external oxidants and radical initiators, and hydrogen (H  2  ) is produced as byproduct. When vinylic C(sp  2  )&#8211;H was used instead of allylic C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bond, the cross&#8208;coupling of C(sp  2  )&#8211;H and S&#8211;H was achieved with liberation of H  2  . Such a unique transformation opens up a door toward direct C&#8211;H and S&#8211;H coupling for valuable organosulfur chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylene Diimide Phosphors:&#160; Aggregation Modulated Twin Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylene diimide derived ambient organic phosphors are seldom reported despite their potential structural characteristics to facilitate the triplet harvesting. In this context, highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from simple, heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide derivatives in amorphous matrix and crystalline state is reported here. Multiple intermolecular interactions among these phosphors, such as halogen&#8208;carbonyl and halogen&#8208;p resulted in the modulation of phosphorescence, cyan emission from monomeric state and orange&#8208;red emission from its aggregated state, to yield twin RTP emission. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable phosphorescence presented here own one of the highest quantum yield (~48%) among various organics in orange&#8208;red emissive region.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of CO2&#160;emission from off&#8208;gases of steel industry by dry reforming of methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a novel process, CO  2&#160;  &#160;and CH  4  &#160;from the off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace are used in homogeneous reforming of those green&#8208;house gases to valuable syngas, a mixture of H  2  &#160;and CO. Synthetic mixtures of the off&#8208;gases from those large apparatuses of steel industry are fed to a high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure flow reactor at varying temperature, pressure, residence time, and mixing ratio of coke oven gas (COG) to blast furnace gas (BFG). In this study, a maximal reduction of 78.5% CO  2  &#160;and a CH  4  &#160;conversion of 95% could be achieved at 1350&#176;C, 5.5 bar and a COG/BFG ratio of 0.6. Significant carbonaceous deposits were formed but did not block the reactor tube in the operational time window allowing cyclic operation of the process. These measurements were based on prior thermodynamic analysis and kinetic predictions using an elementary step reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Hidden Mechanism Under Roughness&#8208;enhanced Selectivity of Carbon Monoxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed with the use of high roughness electrocatalyst. However, the two well&#8208;known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, were demonstrated to be failed by recent experiments. Here we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness&#8208;induced high CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface. Several ways to optimize CORR selectivity are predicted. Our work highlights the kinetics in electrocatalysis on nanocatalysts, and provides a conceptually new principle for future catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Reduction of Transition&#8208;metal Phosphates to Transition&#8208;metal Phosphides by Combining Temperature&#8208;programmed Reduction and Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;programmed reduction of transition&#8208;metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature&#8208;programmed reduction&#8208;infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR&#8208;IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH  3  and P  n+  species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200  o  C), and PH  3  was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH  3  and P  n+  during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni  2  P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH  3  and P  n+  . These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni  2  P, and also demonstrate that the TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: From the Establishment of High Throughput Screening to the Design of Tailored Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro), the causative agent of COVID&#8208;19, constitutes a significant drug target. A new fluorogenic substrate was kinetically compared to an internally quenched fluorescent peptide and shown to be ideally suitable for high throughput screening with recombinantly expressed Mpro. Two classes of protease inhibitors, azanitriles and pyridyl esters, were identified, optimized and subjected to in&#8208;depth biochemical characterization. Tailored peptides equipped with the unique azanitrile warhead exhibited concomitant inhibition of Mpro and cathepsin L, a protease relevant for viral cell entry. Pyridyl indole esters were analyzed by a positional scanning. Our focused approach towards Mpro inhibitors proved to be superior to virtual screening. With two irreversible inhibitors, azanitrile 8 (kinac/Ki = 37,500 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, Ki = 24.0 nM) and pyridyl ester 17 (kinac/Ki = 29,100 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, Ki = 10.0 nM), promising drug candidates for further development have been discovered.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro), the causative agent of COVID&#8208;19, constitutes a significant drug target. A new fluorogenic substrate was kinetically compared to an internally quenched fluorescent peptide and shown to be ideally suitable for high throughput screening with recombinantly expressed Mpro. Two classes of protease inhibitors, azanitriles and pyridyl esters, were identified, optimized and subjected to in&#8208;depth biochemical characterization.

         <title>An endoplasmic reticulum &#8211; specific pro&#8208;amplifier of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folding and export of proteins and hydrolysis of unfolded proteins are disbalanced in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cancer cells leading to so called ER stress. Agents further augmenting this effect are used as anticancer drugs including clinically approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. However, these drugs can affect normal cells, which also rely strongly on ER functions, leading e.g. to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other side effects. Herein we suggested a solution for this problem. In particular, we developed ER&#8208;targeted prodrugs activated only in cancer cells in the presence of elevated ROS amounts. These compounds are conjugates of cholic acid with N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrugs. We confirmed their accumulation in the ER of cancer cells, their anticancer efficacy and cancer cell specificity. These prodrugs induce ER stress, attenuate mitochondrial membrane potential and generate mitochondrial ROS leading to cell death via necrosis. We also demonstrated that the new prodrugs are activated in vivo in Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma murine model.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Engineering in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Towards Advanced Mixed Matrix Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly permselective and durable membrane materials have been sought for energy&#8208;efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) comprising a polymer matrix and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for this application; however, rational matching of filler&#8208;matrix is challenging and their separation performances need to be further improved. Here, we propose a novel strategy of &#8220;defect engineering&#8221; in MOFs as an additional degree of freedom to design advanced MMMs. MMMs incorporated with defect&#8208;engineered MOFs exhibit exceptionally high C3H6 permeability and maintained C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, especially with enhanced stability under industrial mixed&#8208;gas conditions. The gas transport, sorption, and material characterizations reveal that the defect sites in MOFs provide the resulting MMMs with not only ultrafast diffusion pathways but also favorable C3H6 sorption by forming &#960;&#8208;complexation with unsaturated open metal sites, confirmed by in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;IR studies. Most importantly, the concept is also valid for different polymer matrices and gas pairs, demonstrating its versatile potential in other fields.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinspired smart materials with synergistic allochroic luminescence and complex deformation are expected to play an important role in many areas of science and technology. However, it is still challenging to fabricate such soft actuators with high programmability, which can be manipulated  in&#8208;situ  with high spatial resolution. Herein, we have incorporated terminally functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission active tetraphenylethene derivative and photochromic spiropyran moieties into the networks of liquid crystal elastomers through covalent bonding to obtain the synergistic photochromic luminescence and programmable soft actuators. Bio&#8208;mimic functions and auxetic metamaterial&#8208;like devices&#160;were demonstrated feasible based on the combination of assembly and origami&#8208;programming strategy. These bioinspired devices with synergistic photochromic luminescence and complex photodeformation abilities could provide an elegant strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional liquid crystal actuators that could find potential applications in biomimetic soft robotics, camouflage devices, metamaterials, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing new optimized bifunctional photocatalyst is of great significant for achieving the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O  2&#160;  batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O  2  &#160;  system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra&#8208;large size and few&#8208;layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra&#8208;low charge potential of 1.90 V and ultra&#8208;high discharge of 3.51 V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li&#8208;O  2&#160;  batteries, and these results have realized the round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185%. In addition, this photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O  2  batteries exhibits a high rate (129 % round&#8208;trip efficiency at 1 mA/cm  2  ), a prolonged cycling life with 92 % efficiency retention after 100 cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170 mAh/g at 0.75 mA/cm  2  . This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.</dc:description>

         <title>FRET Modulated Signaling: A Versatile Strategy to Construct Photoelectrochemical Microsensors for in Vivo Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microelectrode&#8208;based electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors are promising candidates for in vivo analysis of biologically important chemicals. However, limited selectivity in complicated biological systems and poor adaptability to electrochemically non&#8208;active species restrained their applications. Herein, we propose the concept of modulating the PEC output by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The emission of energy donor was dependent on the concentration of target SO2, which in turn served as the modulator of the photocurrent signal of the photoactive material. The employment of optical modulation circumvented the problem of selectivity, and the as&#8208;fabricated PEC microelectrode showed good stability and reproducibility in vivo. It was able to monitor fluctuations of SO2 levels in brains of rat models of cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion and febrile seizure. More significantly, such a FRET modulated signaling strategy can be extended to diverse analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Probes for Aggregated Protein Imaging via Michael Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent chemical reactions to modify aggregated proteins are rare. Here, we reported covalent Michael addition can generally occur upon protein aggregation. Such reactivity was initially discovered by a bioinspired fluorescent color&#8208;switch probe mimicking the photo&#8208;conversion mechanism of Kaede fluorescent protein. This probe was dark with folded proteins but turned on red fluorescence (620 nm) when it non&#8208;covalently bound to misfolded proteins. Supported by the biochemical and mass spectrometry results, the probe chemoselectively reacted with the reactive cysteines of aggregated proteins via covalent Michael addition and gradually switched to green fluorescence (515 nm) upon protein aggregation. Exploiting this Michael addition chemistry in the malachite green dye derivatives demonstrated its general applicability and chemical tunability, resulting in different fluorescence color&#8208;switch responses. Our work may offer a new avenue to explore other chemical reactions upon protein aggregation and design covalent probes for imaging, chemical proteomics, and therapeutic purposes</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvating and Low&#8208;Dielectricity Cosolvent for Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphases in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal anode holds great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, while the insufficient fundamental understanding of the complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the major obstacle for the full demonstration of their potentials in working batteries. The characteristics of SEI highly depend on the inner solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). In this contribution, we clarify the critical significance of cosolvent properties on both Li+ solvation structure and the SEI formation on working Li metal anodes. Universally, non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) cosolvents intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ by affording a low dielectric environment. The abundant positively&#8208;charged anion&#8208;cation aggregates generated as the introduction of NL cosolvents are preferentially brought to the negatively&#8208;charged Li anode surface, inducing an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. A solvent diagram is further built to illustrate that a solvent with both proper relative binding energy toward Li+ and dielectric constant is suitable as NL cosolvent. This work elucidates the significance of fundamental physicochemical theory in guiding electrolyte design and calls for more efforts to rationally apply the cosolvents for stable Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>When Fluxionality Beats Size Selection:&#160;
Acceleration of Ostwald Ripening of Sub&#8208;Nano Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Size selection was demonstrated to suppress Ostwald ripening of supported catalytic nanoparticles. We show here that when the supported clusters are sub&#8208;nanometer in size and highly fluxional, such as Pt clusters on the rutile TiO  2  (110) surface, this paradigm breaks down, and the established theory of sintering needs a revision. At temperatures characteristic of catalysis (i.e. 700 K), sub&#8208;nano clusters thermally populate many low&#8208;energy metastable isomers. As these isomers all have different geometric and electronic structures, and thus, formation and dissociation energies (in lieu of surface energy), Ostwald ripening is not suppressed, despite the size&#8208;selection. However, some clusters arise as magic numbers in terms of sintering stability at the ensemble level. The acceleration of sintering by metastable species persists though weakens in polydisperse cluster systems. Lastly, we propose a competing pathways theory for sintering, which at the atomistic level, describes the found size&#8208;specific sintering behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Organosulfide&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are a new class of electrolytes with unique properties. However, the intermolecular interactions of DEEs are mostly dominated by Li&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions, limiting the diversity of chemical space and material constituents. Herein, we report a new class of DEEs induced by Li&#183;&#183;&#183;N interactions between 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The strong ion&#8208;dipole interaction triggers the deep eutectic phenomenon, thus liberating the Li  +  from LiTFSI and endowing the DEEs with promising ionic conductivity. These DEEs show admirable intrinsic safety, which cannot be ignited by flame. The DEE at the molar ratio of DpyDS:LiTFSI = 4:1 (abbreviated as DEE&#8208;4:1) is electrochemically stable between 2.1 and 4.0 V vs. Li/Li  +  , and exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.5 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  at 50 &#186;C. The Li/LiFePO  4  half cell with DEE&#8208;4:1 can provide a reversible capacity of 130 mAh g  &#8208;1  and Coulombic efficiency above 98% at 50 &#186;C.</dc:description>

         <title>A self&#8208;assembled homochiral radical cage with paramagnetic behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensation of an inherently  C  3  &#8208;symmetric polychlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical trisaldehyde with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN) yields a [4+4] tetrahedral radical cage as a racemic pair of homochiral enantiomers in 75% isolated yield. The structure was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the homochirality of each cage framework. The homochirality results from intramolecular [CH&#8231;&#8231;&#8231;&#960;] and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the cage framework. The four PTM radicals in a cage undergo weak through&#8208;space coupling. Magnetic measurements demonstrated that each cage bears 3.58 spins.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on the lithiation, borylation, and 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement of O&#8208;cycloalkyl 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A broad range of acyclic primary and secondary 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoate (TIB) esters have been used in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions, but cyclic TIB esters have not. We have studied the use of cyclic TIB esters in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions and looked at the effect of ring size (3 &#8594; 6&#8208;membered rings) on the three key steps of the lithiation&#8211;borylation protocol: deprotonation, borylation and 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. While all rings sizes could be deprotonated, the cyclohexyl case was impractically slow, and the cyclopentyl example underwent &#945;&#8208;elimination faster than deprotonation at &#8722;78 &#176;C and so could not be used. Both cyclobutyl and cyclopropyl cases underwent rapid borylation, but only the cyclobutyl substrate underwent 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Thus, the cyclobutyl TIB ester occupies a &#8220;Goldilocks zone,&#8221; being small enough for deprotonation and large enough to enable 1,2&#8208;migration. The generality of the reaction was explored with a broad range of boronic esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Enantioselective Control of the C&#8722;N Stereogenic Axis via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented example of a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction of  N&#8208;arylindoles is reported. Highly enantioenriched  N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines with C&#8722;N bond axial chirality are obtained via dynamic kinetic resolution. The hydrogen bond donor introduced on the bottom aromatic ring, forming a secondary interaction with the phosphoryl oxygen, is essential to achieving high enantioselectivity. A wide variety of substituents are tolerable with this transformation to provide up to 98% e.e. The application of electron&#8208;withdrawing group&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes enables the control of both axial and point stereogenicity. Biological evaluation of this new and unique scaffold shows promising antiproliferative activity and emphasizes the significance of atroposelective synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed synthesis of Hepta&#8208;differentiated &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: 1 out of 117655 arrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclodextrin poly&#8208;functionalization has fueled progress in their use in multiple applications such as enzyme mimicry, but also in the polymer sciences, luminescence, as sensors or for biomedical applications&#8230; However, the regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on b&#8208;cyclodextrin is still very limited. Here, we uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, expanding the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using DIBAL&#8208;H promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized b&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.</dc:description>

The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized b&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
