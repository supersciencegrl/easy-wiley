      <title>Diradical organic one&#8208;dimensional polymers synthesized on a metallic surface</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of radical polymers with control over chemical composition and structure is a milestone in materials science and has re&#8208;emerged recently because of the development of new synthetic methods to produce stable radical organic compounds. However, their synthesis is remarkably challenging due to the inherent reactivity induced by the presence of unpaired electrons in their structure. Here, we report on the synthesis and characterization of atomically precise one&#8208;dimensional diradical peripentacene polymers on a Au(111) surface. By means of high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy complemented by theoretical simulations, we provide an evidence of their magnetic properties, which arise from the presence of two unpaired spins at their termini. In addition, we probe a transition of their magnetic properties related to the length of the polymer. Peripentacene dimers exhibit an antiferromagnetic (S = 0) singlet ground state. They are characterized by singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (J  eff  ) of 2.5 meV, whereas trimers and longer peripentacene polymers reveal a paramagnetic nature and feature Kondo fingerprints at each terminus due to the unpaired spin. Our work provides access to the precise fabrication of polymers featuring diradical character and potentially useful in carbon&#8208;based optoelectronics and spintronics.</dc:description>

      <title>NIR&#8208;II Chemiluminescence Molecular Sensor for In&#8208;Vivo High Contrast Inflammation Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Chemiluminescence (CL) sensing without the external excitation ligh  t and autofluorescence interference has been applied to high&#8208;contrast  in vitro  immunoassays and  in vivo  inflammation and tumor microenvironment detection. However, conventional CL sensing usually operates in the range of 400&#8208;850 nm, which limits the high&#8208;performance of  in vivo  imaging due to the serious light scattering effect and signals attenuation in tissue. To address this challenge,  here we present a new type of  CL sensor in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II CLS) with deep penetration depth (~ 8 mm) by employing successive CL resonance energy transfer (CRET) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the activated CL substrate to two rationally designed donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor fluorophores BTD540 and BBTD700. NIR&#8208;II CLS can be selectively activated by hydrogen peroxide over other reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Moreover, NIR&#8208;II CLS is capable of detecting local inflammation in mice with 4.5&#8208;fold higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) than that under NIR&#8208;II fluorescence modality.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress of Fluorogenic Probes/Inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;Lactamase and their Applications in Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Lactam antibiotics are generally perceived as one of the greatest inventions of the 20  th  century, and these small molecular compounds have saved millions of lives. However, upon clinical application of antibiotics, the &#946;&#8208;lactamase secreted by pathogenic bacteria can lead to the gradual development of  drug resistance  . &#946;&#8208;Lactamase is a hydrolase that can efficiently hydrolyze and destroy &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. It develops and spreads rapidly in pathogens, and the drug&#8208;resistant bacteria pose a severe threat to human health and development. As a result, detecting and inhibiting the activities of &#946;&#8208;lactamase are of great value for the rational use of antibiotics and the treatment of infectious diseases. At present, many specific detection methods and inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;lactamase have been developed and applied in clinical practice. In this review, we describe the resistance mechanism of bacteria producing &#946;&#8208;lactamase and further summarize the fluorogenic probes, inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;lactamase, and their applications in the treatment of infectious diseases. It may be valuable to design fluorogenic probes with improved selectivity, sensitivity, and effectiveness to further identify the inhibitors for &#946;&#8208;lactamases and eventually overcome bacterial resistance.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereospecific 1,2&#8208;Migrations of Boronate Complexes Induced by Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>The stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes is one of the most representative reactions in boron chemistry. This process has been used extensively to develop powerful methods for asymmetric synthesis, with applications spanning from pharmaceuticals to natural products. Typically, 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes is driven by displacement of an  &#945;  &#8208;leaving group, oxidation of an  &#945;  &#8208;boryl radical, or electrophilic activation of an alkenyl boronate complex. The aim of this article is to summarize the recent advances in the rapidly expanding field of electrophile&#8208;induced stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of groups from boron to  sp  2  and  sp  3  carbon centers. It will be shown that three different conceptual approaches can be utilized to enable the 1,2&#8208;migration of boronate complexes: stereospecific Zweifel&#8208;type reactions, catalytic conjunctive coupling reactions, and transition metal&#8208;free  sp  2  &#8208;  sp  3  couplings.

      <title>Alleviating cellular oxidative stress through treatment with superoxide&#8208;triggered persulfide prodrugs</title>
      <dc:description>Overproduction of superoxide anion (O  2  &#8729;  &#8211;  ), the primary cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), is implicated in various human diseases. To reduce cellular oxidative stress caused by overproduction of superoxide, we developed a compound that reacts with O  2  &#8729;  &#8211;  to release a persulfide (RSSH), a type of reactive sulfur species related to the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S). Termed  SOPD&#8208;NAC  , this persulfide donor reacts specifically with O  2  &#8729;  &#8211;  , decomposing to generate  N  &#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC) persulfide. To enhance persulfide delivery to cells, we conjugated the SOPD motif to a short, self&#8208;assembling peptide (Bz&#8208;CFFE&#8208;NH  2  ) to make a superoxide&#8208;responsive, persulfide&#8208;donating peptide (  SOPD&#8208;Pep  ). Both  SOPD&#8208;NAC  and  SOPD&#8208;Pep  delivered persulfides/H  2  S to H9C2 cardiomyocytes and lowered ROS levels as confirmed by quantitative  in vitro  fluorescence imaging studies. Additional  in vitro  studies on RAW 264.7 macrophages showed that  SOPD&#8208;Pep  mitigated toxicity induced by phorbol 12&#8208;myristate 13&#8208;acetate (PMA) more effectively than  SOPD&#8208;NAC  and several control compounds, including common H  2  S donors.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Dispersion of Pd on TiO2 During Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction: Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pd</title>
      <dc:description>Expanding the application scope of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to high&#8208;temperature hydrogenation requires materials that thermodynamically favor metal atom isolation over cluster formation under these conditions. Here, we show that Pd can be predominantly dispersed as isolated atoms onto TiO  2  during the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction at 400 &#176;C. Achieving atomic dispersion requires an artificial increase of the absolute TiO  2  surface area by an order of magnitude and can be accomplished by physically mixing a precatalyst (Pd/TiO  2  ) with neat TiO  2  prior to the rWGS reaction. The  in situ  dispersion of Pd was reflected through a continuous increase of rWGS activity over 92 h and supported by kinetic analysis, infrared spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The thermodynamic stability of Pd under high&#8208;temperature rWGS conditions is associated with Pd&#8208;Ti coordination (enthalpic stabilization), which seemingly manifests upon O&#8208;vacancy formation, and the artificial increase in TiO  2  surface area (entropic stabilization). In addition to this, steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis suggests an upper limit of two for the number of oxide&#8208;supported atoms required to catalyze the WGS reaction. Our approach to noble metal SACs synthesis can be generally applied and provides a platform to study the reactivity of heterolytically&#8208;activated hydrogen toward unsaturated functional groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Near&#8208;enantiopure trimerization of 9&#8208;Ethynylphenanthrene on a chiral

      <dc:description>Enantioselectivity in heterogeneous catalysis strongly depends on the chirality transfer between catalyst surface and all reactants, intermediates, and the product along the reaction pathway. Here we report the first enantioselective on&#8208;surface synthesis of molecular structures from an intial racemic mixture and without the need of enantiopure modifier molecules.

The observed behavior is in stark contrast to the reaction of 9&#8208;EP on the chiral Pd1&#8208;terminated PdGa{111} surfaces, where 9&#8208;EP monomers that are in nearly enantiopure configuration, dimerize without particular enantiomeric excess. Our findings demonstrate strong chiral recognition and a significant ensemble effect in the PdGa system, hence highlighting the huge potential of chiral intermetallic compounds for enantioselective synthesis and underlining the importance to control the catalytically active sites at the atomic level.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the interaction of polyelectrolyte architectures with proteins and biosystems</title>
      <dc:description>Polyelectrolytes such as e.g. DNA or heparin are long linear or branched macromolecules onto which charges are appended. The counterions neutralizing these charges may dissociate in water and will largely determine the interaction of such polyelectrolytes with biomolecules and in particular with proteins. Here we review studies on the interaction of proteins with polyelectrolytes and how this knowledge can be used for medical applications. Counterion release was identified as the main driving force for the binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes: Patches of positive charge become multivalent counterions of the polyelectrolyte which leads to the release of counterions of the polyelectrolyte and a concomitant increase of entropy. We show this by surveying investigations done on the interaction of proteins with natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes. Special emphasis is laid on sulfated dendritic polyglycerols (dPGS). The entire overview demonstrates that we are moving on to a better understanding of charge&#8208;charge interaction in system of biological relevance. Hence, research along these lines will aid and promote the design of synthetic polyelectrolytes for medical applications.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polyelectrolytes such as e.g. DNA or heparin are long linear or branched macromolecules onto which charges are appended. The counterions neutralizing these charges may dissociate in water and will largely determine the interaction of such polyelectrolytes with biomolecules and in particular with proteins. Here we review studies on the interaction of proteins with polyelectrolytes and how this knowledge can be used for medical applications. Counterion release was identified as the main driving force for the binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes: Patches of positive charge become multivalent counterions of the polyelectrolyte which leads to the release of counterions of the polyelectrolyte and a concomitant increase of entropy. We show this by surveying investigations done on the interaction of proteins with natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes. Special emphasis is laid on sulfated dendritic polyglycerols (dPGS). The entire overview demonstrates that we are moving on to a better understanding of charge&#8208;charge interaction in system of biological relevance. Hence, research along these lines will aid and promote the design of synthetic polyelectrolytes for medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Insect&#8208;Associated Bacteria Assemble the Antifungal Butenolide Gladiofungin by Non&#8208;Canonical Polyketide Chain Termination</title>
      <dc:description>Genome mining of one of the protective symbionts (  Burkholderia gladioli  ) of the invasive beetle  Lagria villosa  revealed a cryptic gene cluster coding for the biosynthesis of a novel antifungal polyketide with a glutarimide pharmacophore.

      <title>Revealing Crystallization Induced Blue Shift Emission of a Di&#8208;Boron Complex by Enhanced Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>Elucidating the effects of crystallization induced blue shift emission of a newly synthesized di&#8208;boron complex (DBC) by enhanced photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in the annihilation pathway was realized for the first time. The 57 nm blue&#8208;shift and great enhancement in the crystalline lattice relative to the DBC solution were attributed to the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) and confirmed by PL imaging, x&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as DFT calculations. It was discovered that ECL at crystalline film/solution interfaces can be further enhanced by means of both coreactant route and RIR. The RIR contributions with coreactant increased ECL up to 5 times more. Very interestingly, the coreactant system was found to give off a redshifted light emission. Mechanistic studies reveal that a difference between location of the ECL in the coreactant route and that in the annihilation pathway leads to an alternative emission wavelength.</dc:description>

      <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere Nanoreactors Loaded with PdCu Nanoparticles: Void&#8208;Confinement Effects in Liquid&#8208;Phase Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoreactors with hollow structures have attracted great interest in catalysis research due to their void&#8208;confinement effects. However, the challenge in unambiguously unraveling these confinement effects is to decouple them from other factors affecting the catalytic behaviors. Here, we synthesize a pair of hollow carbon sphere (HCS) nanoreactors with pre&#8208;synthesized PdCu nanoparticles encapsulated inside of HCS (PdCu@HCS) and supported outside of HCS (PdCu/HCS), respectively, while keeping other structural features the same. Based on the two comparative nanoreactors, void&#8208;confinement effects in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation are investigated in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. It is found that hydrogenations over PdCu@HCS are shown as shape&#8208;selective catalysis, can be accelerated (accumulation of reactants), decelerated (mass transfer limitation) and even inhibited (molecular&#8208;sieving effect), respectively; conversion of the intermediate in the void space can be further promoted. Using this principle, a specific imine is selectively produced. This work provides proofs of concept for fundamental catalysis of the hollow nanoreactors.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorogenic Probe Using a Mislow&#8208;Evans Rearrangement for Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) mediates the biology of wound healing, apoptosis, inflammation, etc. H  2  O  2&#160;  has been fluorometrically imaged with protein&#8208; or small molecule&#8208;based probes. However, only protein&#8208;based probes have afforded temporal insights within seconds. Small molecule&#8208;based electrophilic probes for H  2  O  2  &#160;require many minutes for a sufficient response in biological systems. Here, we report a fluorogenic probe that selectively undergoes a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement (seleno&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement) with H  2  O  2  , followed by an acetal hydrolysis, to produce a green fluorescent molecule in seconds. Unlike other electrophilic probes, the current probe acts as a nucleophile. The fast kinetics enabled real&#8208;time imaging of H  2  O  2  &#160;produced in endothelial cells in 8 seconds (much earlier than previously shown) and H  2  O  2  &#160;in a zebrafish wound healing model.

Critical to the success of this process are not only the use of the copper catalyst as a dual photo&#8208; and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst but also the tuning of NHP&#8208;type esters to inhibit the easily&#8208;occurring homodimerization of alkyl radical and terminal alkyne, respectively. Owing to the use of stable and easily available NHP&#8208;type esters, the reaction features a broader substrate scope compared with their alkyl halide counterparts, covering (hetero)benzyl&#8208;, allyl&#8208;, and aminocarbonyl&#8208;substituted carboxylic acid derivatives, and (hetero)aryl and alkyl as well as silyl alkynes, thus constituting a vital complementary approach for the previous methodology.</dc:description>

      <title>Pt and CuOx decorated TiO2 photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to C2 hydrocarbons in a flow reactor</title>
      <dc:description>Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) has been considered as one of the most promising and attractive catalytic technology to upgrade methane. However, C  2  products (C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  ) from conventional methane conversion have not yielded commercially due to the competition from overoxidation and carbon accumulation at high temperatures. Herein, we reported the co&#8208;deposition of Pt nanoparticles and CuO  x  clusters on TiO  2  (PC&#8208;50), and then used the photocatalyst to demonstrate the first successful case of photocatalytic OCM in a flow reactor operated at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. The optimized Cu  0.1  Pt  0.5  /PC&#8208;50 sample showed a highest yield of C  2  product of 6.8 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  , at the space velocity of 2400 h  &#8208;1  , two times higher than the sum of the activity of Pt/PC&#8208;50 (1.07 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  ) and Cu/PC&#8208;50 (1.9 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  ), and it might also be the highest among photocatalytic methane conversions reported so far under atmospheric pressure. A high selectivity of 60% to C  2  was also comparable to the benchmark work of conventional high temperature (&gt;943K) thermal catalysis. It is proposed that Pt functioned as an electron acceptor facilitating charge separation, while holes could transfer to CuO  x  avoiding deep dehydrogenation and overoxidation of C  2  products. This work provides a new revenue for photocatalytic methane upgrade.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Preparation of supported metal catalysts with uniform particle size and coordination environment is a challenging and important topic in materials chemistry and catalysis. In this work, we report the regioselective generation of single&#8208;site Ir atoms and their evolution into stabilized subnanometric Ir clusters in MWW zeolite, which are located at the 10MR window connecting the two neighboring 12MR supercages. The size of the subnanometric Ir clusters can be controlled by the post&#8208;synthesis treatments and maintain below 1 nm even after being reduced at 650  o  C, which cannot be readily achieved with samples prepared by conventional impregnation methods. The high structure sensitivity, size&#8208;dependence, of catalytic performance in the alkane hydrogenolysis reaction of Ir clusters in the subnanometric regime is evidenced.</dc:description>

Herein, we discover a general one&#8208;step approach to fabricate supramolecular porous polyelectrolyte membranes (SPPMs) from a single poly(ionic liquid) (PIL). The experimental results and theoretical simulation suggested that SPPMs were formed by a hydrogen bond&#8208;induced phase separation of a PIL between its polar and apolar domains, which were linked together by water molecules. This unique feature was capable of modulating microscopic porous architectures and thus the global mechanical property of SPPMs by a rational design of the molecular structure of PILs. Such SPPMs could switch porosity upon thermal stimuli, as exemplified by dynamically adaptive transparency to thermal fluctuation.

      <title>Beryllium Atom Mediated Dinitrogen Activation via Coupling with Carbon Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>The reactions of laser&#8208;ablated beryllium atoms with dinitrogen and carbon monoxide mixtures form the end&#8208;on bonded NNBeCO and side&#8208;on bonded (&#951;  2  &#8208;N  2  )BeCO isomers in solid argon, which are predicted by quantum chemical calculations to be almost isoenergetic.

      <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Host: Not Merely Enhanced Stability</title>
      <dc:description>As an emerging optical material, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties and show great potential for various optoelectronic applications. However, the inherent inferior stability against moisture, oxygen, light and heat limit their practical application. As well, the exploration and development of perovskite NCs with novel properties and functions are newly opened challenges. To achieve these goals, the integration and encapsulation of perovskite NCs with multifunctional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form perovskite NC@MOF composites, is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and broadening the application scope. In this minireview, we summarize and discuss the synthesis strategies and functional mechanisms of perovskite NC@MOF composites, along with applications of light emitting diodes (LED), information security, photocatalysis, sensing, and detection. We further briefly point out the current challenges as well as the future opportunities for the emerged composite materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As an emerging optical material, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties and show great potential for various optoelectronic applications. However, the inherent inferior stability against moisture, oxygen, light and heat limit their practical application. As well, the exploration and development of perovskite NCs with novel properties and functions are newly opened challenges. To achieve these goals, the integration and encapsulation of perovskite NCs with multifunctional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form perovskite NC@MOF composites, is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and broadening the application scope. In this minireview, we summarize and discuss the synthesis strategies and functional mechanisms of perovskite NC@MOF composites, along with applications of light emitting diodes (LED), information security, photocatalysis, sensing, and detection. We further briefly point out the current challenges as well as the future opportunities for the emerged composite materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Regenerable Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photo&#8208;enhanced Uranium Adsorption from Seawater</title>
      <dc:description>Uranium is a key resource for the development of the nuclear industry, and extracting uranium from the natural seawater is one of the most promising ways to address the shortage of uranium resources. Herein, a semiconducting covalent organic framework (named NDA&#8208;TN&#8208;AO) with excellent photocatalytic and photoelectric activities was synthesized. The excellent photocatalytic effect endowed NDA&#8208;TN&#8208;AO with a high anti&#8208;biofouling activity by generating biotoxic reactive oxygen species, and promoting photoelectrons to reduce the adsorbed U(VI) to insoluble U(IV), thereby increasing the uranium extraction capacity. Owing to the photoinduced effect, the adsorption capacity of NDA&#8208;TN&#8208;AO to uranium in seawater reaches 6.07 mg g &#8208;1  , which is 1.33 times of that in dark. The NDA&#8208;TN&#8208;AO with enhanced adsorption capacity is a promising material for extracting uranium from the natural seawater.</dc:description>

      <title>Immunological Evaluation of Co&#8208;assembling a Lipidated Peptide Antigen and Lipophilic Adjuvants as Self&#8208;adjuvanting Anti&#8208;breast Cancer Vaccine Candidates</title>

Under vaccination concentrations, respective lipophilic adjuvants underwent co&#8208;assembly with lipidated CH401, which boosted the anti&#8208;CH401 IgG and IgM production. In particular, &#945;&#8208;GalCer was responsible for the most significant immune activation. Therefore, our newly developed vaccine design enabled the optimization of adjuvants against the antigenic CH401 peptide in a simple preparatory manner. Overall, our co&#8208;assembling vaccine design opens the door for efficient and practical self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccine development.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical Structure of NiMo Hydrodesulfurization Catalysts Determined by Ptychographic X&#8208;ray Computed Tomography</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrodesulphurization, the removal of sulphur from crude oils, is an essential catalytic process in the petroleum industry safeguarding the production of clean hydrocarbons. Sulphur removal is critical for the functionality of downstream processes and vital to the elimination of environmental pollutants. The effectiveness of such an endeavour is among other factors determined by the structural arrangement of the heterogeneous catalyst. Namely, the accessibility of the catalytically active molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) slabs located on the surfaces of a porous alumina carrier. Here, we examined a series of pristine sulfided Mo and NiMo hydrodesulphurization catalysts of increasing metal loading prepared on commercial alumina carriers using ptychographic X&#8208;ray computed nanotomography. Structural analysis revealed a build consisting of two interwoven support matrix elements differing in nanoporosity. With increasing metal loading, approaching that of industrial catalysts, these matrix elements exhibit a progressively dissimilar MoS  2  surface coverage as well as MoS  2  cluster formation at the matrix element boundaries. This is suggestive of metal deposition limitations and/ or catalyst activation and following prohibitive of optimal catalytic utilization. These results will allow for diffusivity calculations, a better rationale of current generation catalyst performance as well as a better distribution of the active phase in next&#8208;generation hydrodesulphurization catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Porphyrin&#8208;ionic liquid coassembly polymorphism controlled by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding and controlling multicomponent coassembly is of primary importance in different fields, such as materials fabrication, pharmaceutical polymorphism and supramolecular polymerization, but these aspects have been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we discover that liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) into ion cluster&#8208;rich and ion cluster&#8208;poor liquid phases is the first step prior to coassembly nucleation based on a model system of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin and ionic liquids. The LLPS&#8208;formed droplets serve as the nucleation precursors, which determine the resulting structures and properties of coassemblies. Coassembly polymorphisms and tunable supramolecular phase transition behaviors can be achieved by regulating the intermolecular interactions at the LLPS stage. These findings elucidate the key role of LLPS in multicomponent coassembly evolution and enable it to be an effective strategy to control coassembly polymorphisms as well as supramolecular phase transitions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding and controlling multicomponent coassembly is of primary importance in different fields, such as materials fabrication, pharmaceutical polymorphism and supramolecular polymerization, but these aspects have been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we discover that liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) into ion cluster&#8208;rich and ion cluster&#8208;poor liquid phases is the first step prior to coassembly nucleation based on a model system of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin and ionic liquids. The LLPS&#8208;formed droplets serve as the nucleation precursors, which determine the resulting structures and properties of coassemblies. Coassembly polymorphisms and tunable supramolecular phase transition behaviors can be achieved by regulating the intermolecular interactions at the LLPS stage. These findings elucidate the key role of LLPS in multicomponent coassembly evolution and enable it to be an effective strategy to control coassembly polymorphisms as well as supramolecular phase transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Perovskite CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots Driven by Photo&#8208;Induced Alkynyl Homocoupling Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Surface&#8208;bound ligand molecules with suitable chemical and physical properties have been widely employed not only in nanocrystal synthesis where the size, morphology, phase structure, and even optoelectronic features can be defined, they have also been utilized in modulating the assembly behaviors of nanocrystals in terms of the packing modes, dimensions, as well as functionalities. Herein, we report a facile growth of 3&#8208;dimensional CsPbBr  3  perovskite supercrystals (PSCs) self&#8208;assembled from individual CsPbBr  3  perovskite quantum dot (PQD). By varying the carbon chain length of the ligand molecule, 1&#8208;alkynyl acid, different morphologies of PSCs were obtained accompanied with over 1000&#8208;fold photoluminescence improvement compared with that of PQDs. Systematic analyses have shown for the first time that under UV irradiation, CsBr, the byproduct formed during PQDs synthesis could effectively catalyze the homocoupling reaction between two alkynyl groups, which further worked as a driving force to push forward the self&#8208;assembly of PQDs. This discovery has offered a brand new and reliable strategy for growing high quality PSCs with significantly improved performance, which shall also be applicable to other nanocrystal systems aiming at unprecedented photonic, optoelectronic, and/or magnetic functionalities.</dc:description>

      <title>Composition&#8208;Tunable Antiperovskite CuxIn1&#8208;xNNi3 as Superior Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a group of newly reported antiperovskite nitrides Cu  x  In  1&#8208;  x  NNi  3  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with tunable composition are employed as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Cu  0.4  In  0.6  NNi  3  shows the highest&#8208;intrinsic performance of the developed catalysts in this work with a merely 42 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  . High current density stability test at 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  shows its super&#8208;stable performance with only 7 mV increasing on the overpotential after more than 60&#8208;hour measurement, which surpass that of the commercial Pt/C (increase 170 mV). By partial substitution, the derived antiperovskite nitride achieves a smaller kinetic barrier of water dissociation compared to the unsubstituted InNNi  3  and CuNNi  3  , revealed by first&#8208;principle calculations. It is found that the partially substituted Cu  x  In  1&#8208;x  NNi  3  suggests a thermal neutral and desirable Gibbs free energy of hydrogen for HER. This enhancement is assumed to the tailoring of the energy of d&#8208;band center arose by the A&#8208;site (A = Cu or In) substitution, which optimizes the interaction between the antiperovskite nitride and the adsorbates. This work ushers in an effective strategy for optimizing the electrocatalytic activity of antiperovskite nitrides by tuning their composition.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Carboxylates</title>
      <dc:description>Carboxylate esters have many desirable features as electrophiles for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling: they are easy to access, robust during multistep synthesis, and mass efficient in coupling reactions. Alkenyl carboxylates, a class of readily prepared non&#8208;aromatic electrophiles, remain difficult to functionalize via cross&#8208;coupling.

Furthermore, these reactions can proceed by two distinct mechanisms for C&#8211;O bond activation. A Pd(0)/(II) catalytic cycle is viable when using a Pd(0) precatalyst, with turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8211;O oxidative addition; however, an alternative pathway that involves alkene carbopalladation and &#946;&#8208;carboxyl elimination is proposed for Pd(II) precatalysts.

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part C. Toward Consilience</title>
      <dc:description>
In the last part of our Essay, we outline a path of consilience, with a role both for simulation and for understanding. Experiment draws us together. Two case studies show what brings joy, and make it clear that how intertwined computation and theory&#8208;building has been for the authors.

Abstract
In the last part of our Essay, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and for searchers for understanding. We begin by looking at theory and simulation, surrounded as they are by and interacting with experiment, especially in Chemistry. Experimenters ask questions both conceptual and numerical, and so draw the communities together. Two case studies show what brings the theoretician authors joy in this playground, and two more detailed ones make it clear that computation/simulation is anyway deeply intertwined with theory&#8208;building in what we do, or for that matter, anywhere in the profession. From a definition of science we try to foresee how simulation and theory will interact in the AI&#8208;dominated future. We posit that Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a link to Art, and a passage to a renewed vision of the sacred in science.

      <title>Enantiodivergent cyclization by inversion of the reactivity in ambiphilic molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Inverting the reactivity of the functional groups in ambiphilic molecules provides a new synthetic strategy to carry out late&#8208;stage enantiodivergence. Both enantiomers of the final compound can be obtained from a common chiral precursor. As a proof of concept, the synthesis of substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered oxacycles is described. The key step is the cyclization of an ambiphilic linear precursor bearing a propargylic alcohol and an epoxide linked through an alkyl chain. Through a slight modification of these linear precursors and employing different reaction conditions, these functional groups can inverse their chemical reactivity, producing one enantiomer or another of the final product. This enantiodivergent cyclization involves three stereogenic centers that can undergo fully controlled retention or inversion of their configuration depending on the cyclization pathway that is activated. The cyclization provides late&#8208;stage enantiodivergence, enabling the synthesis of either enantiomers of the oxacycles from a common chiral substrate with total transfer of the enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

These H&#8208;bonded columns pack parallelly such that molecules arrange head&#8208;to&#8208;tail forming linear non&#8208;covalent chains in planes perpendicular to the screw axis. These chains arrange parallelly to form molecular layers, which twist&#8208;stack along the screw axis.

      <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Imide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an extensively studied class of porous materials, which distinguish themselves from other porous polymers in their crystallinity and high degree of modularity, enabling a wide range of applications.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity of the Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate: Triggerable C&#8208;C Bond Formation and Rate Control in Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity (MLC) had a remarkable impact on transition metal chemistry and catalysis. By use of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate, [1]  &#8208;  , which features a square&#8208;planar Al(III), we transfer this concept into the p&#8208;block and fully elucidate its mechanisms by experiment and theory. Complementary to transition metal&#8208;based MLC (aromatization upon substrate binding), substrate binding in [1]  &#8208;  occurs by dearomatization of the ligand. The aluminate trapps carbonyls by the formation of C&#8208;C and Al&#8208;O bonds, but the products maintain full reversibility and outstanding dynamic exchange rates. Remarkably, the C&#8208;C bonds can be formed or cleaved by the addition or removal of lithium cations, permitting unprecedented control over the system's constitutional state. Moreover, the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative substrate interaction allows to twist the kinetics of catalytic hydroboration reactions in a unique sense. Ultimately, this work describes the evolution of an anti&#8208;van't Hoff/Le Bel species from their being as a structural curiosity to their application as a reagent and catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging to Reveal Mitochondrial Nucleoprotein Dynamics with Reactive Oxygen Species Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the biomolecular interactions in a specific organelle has been a long&#8208;standing challenge because it requires super&#8208;resolution imaging to resolve the spatial locations and dynamic interactions of multiple biomacromolecules. Two key difficulties, however, are that molecular probes suitable for super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy are rather rare, and more adversely the use of multiple probes complicates their cellular uptakes, biodistributions, and spectral distinctions. Here, we report a quinolinium derivative probe that is selectively enriched in mitochondria, and switches on in three different fluorescence modes in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), protein, and nucleic acid, enabling the visualization of mitochondrial nucleoprotein dynamics. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy reveals that the proteins localize at mitochondrial cristae and largely fuse with nucleic acids to form nucleoproteins, whereas increasing H2O2 level leads to disassociation of nucleic acid&#8208;protein complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Why Boron Nitride is such a Selective Catalyst for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, boron&#8208;containing materials and in particular boron nitride, have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes such as propane. Until now, no mechanism exists that can explain both the unprecedented selectivity, the observed surface oxyfunctionalization, as well as the peculiar kinetic features of the reaction.&#160;&#160;In this contribution we combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. Based on our results, we argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface&#8208;mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Based on known radical propagation steps, we quantitatively describe the oxygen pressure&#8208;dependent relative formation of the main product propylene and by&#8208;product ethylene. The free radical intermediates are most likely what differentiates this catalytic system from less selective vanadium&#8208;based catalysts. Indeed, although the mechanism of this benchmark catalyst is also not yet unambiguously established, it is generally assumed that radical intermediates are rapidly converted to stable molecular products on the catalyst surface before they can desorb. The new insights obtained in this work highlight the importance of the mechanistic differences between these two catalyst families which could lead to better design principles and improved catalytic systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Zeolite&#8208;catalyzed alkene cracking is key to optimize the size of hydrocarbons.

Further, the supported iron dimer, serving as cooperative metal&#8208;metal sites, has been experimentally demonstrated for efficient oxygen evolution catalysis. Our findings offer an atomic insight to guide the future design of ultrasmall metal clusters bearing outstanding catalytic capabilities for the vital chemical transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A High Performing Zn&#8208;ion Battery Cathode Enabled by in&#8208;situ Transformation of V2O5 Atomic Layers</title>
      <dc:description>Developing high capacity and stable cathodes is a key to successful commercialization of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Pure layered V  2  O  5  has a high theoretical capacity (585 mAh/g), but it suffers severe capacity decay. Pre&#8208;inserting cations into V  2  O  5  can substantially stabilize the performance, but at an expense of lowered capacity. Here we show that an atomic layer deposition derived V  2  O  5  can be an excellent ZIB cathode with high capacity and exceptional cycle stability at once. We report for the first time a rapid  in&#8208;situ  on&#8208;site transformation of V  2  O  5  atomic layers into Zn  3  V  2  O  7  (OH)  2  &#8901;2H  2  O (ZVO) nanoflake clusters, also a known Zn&#8208;ion and proton intercalatable material. The extraordinary electrochemical performance arises from the unique attributes of the ALD&#8208;V  2  O  5  : high concentration of reactive sites, strong bonding to the conductive substrate, nanosized thickness and binder&#8208;free composition, all of which facilitate ionic transport and promote the best utilization of the active material. We also provide new insights into the V  2  O  5  &#8208;dissolution mechanisms for different Zn&#8208;salt aqueous electrolytes and their implications to the cycle stability. Our work offers an appealing engineering solution to develop high&#8208;capacity and stable cathodes for commercial ZIBs and contributes to the fundamental understanding of ionic storage mechanisms in rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Conversion of a Paramagnetic FeCo Complex into a Molecular Magnetic Switch with Tuneable Hysteresis</title>
      <dc:description>A key challenge in the design of magnetic molecular switches is to obtain bistability at room temperature. Here, we show that a moderate pressure allows converting a paramagnetic Fe  III  2  Co  II  2  square complex into a molecular switch exhibiting a full dia&#8208; to para&#8208;magnetic transition: Fe  II  Co  III  &#11012; Fe  III  Co  II  . Moreover, the complex follows a rare behavior: the higher the pressure is, the broader the magnetic hysteresis is. Thus, the application of an adequate pressure allows inducing a magnetic bi&#8208;stability at room temperature with predictable hysteresis width. The structural studies at different pressures suggest that the pressure&#8208;enhanced bi&#8208;stability is due to the strengthening of intermolecular interactions upon pressure increase. An original microscopic Ising&#8208;like model including pressure effects, is developed to simulate this unprecedented behavior. Overall, this study shows that FeCo complexes could be very sensitive piezo&#8208;switches with potential use as sensors.</dc:description>

&lt;p&gt;Puzzling over a diradical:&#160;Piecing together the &#8220;correct&#8221; combination of an azaacene, phenoxyl groups and dithienobenzene regiosiomers is rewarded by obtaining quinoidal azaacenes with almost pure diradical character stable for weeks in the solid state and persistent in solution. For more information see the Communication by J. Freudenberg, U.&#8197;H.&#8197;F. Bunz et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20191597710.1002/anie.201915977&lt;/a&gt;).

Escaping from the planar geometry of trivalent boron Lewis acids is possible by incorporating a boron atom at the edge of the triptycene scaffold.

Berionni and co&#8208;workers describe the preparation of the elusive 9&#8208;boratriptycene, a triarylborane with unprecedented structure and high Lewis acidity, due to the very low reorganization energy of the triptycene core and the absence of conjugation of its B atom orbitals with the orthogonally oriented aryl rings.

Just like a horse capturing a pawn to win the position at a chess game, nitrogen&#8208;centered radical selectivity for hydrogen atom abstraction allows for a novel directed aliphatic C&#8722;H fluorination methodology.

The results provide a quantitative molecular level understanding of the initial activation by a single polar solvent molecule in the radical cation mechanism for functionalization of diamondoids. A drastic C&#8722;H stretch frequency shift along with quasi&#8208;free internal rotation of the H2O ligand is observed.

      <dc:description>
The ultrafast transformation of a bulk metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) into ultrathin metal oxyhydroxide nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electric&#8208;field hydrolysis is demonstrated by L. Zhang, Q. Chen, M. Hong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202004420). The as&#8208;prepared nanosheets exhibit excellent OER performance, and the evolution process from bulk MOF to metal oxyhydroxide nanosheets is investigated in detail.

      <title>Keteniminium&#8208;Driven Umpolung Difunctionalization of Ynamides</title>
      <dc:description>
Trapped: A nondirected keteniminium&#8208;driven multicomponent 1,2&#8208;umpolung difunctionalization of ynamides with aryl diazonium salts and aryl boronic acids under Pd catalysis for the synthesis of triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is showcased for the first time. This transformation proceeds by 1,3&#8208;migration of an electrophile from in situ generated keteniminium species to the electrophilic &#945;&#8208;position of the ynamide, followed by trapping of nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;vinylic metal species with a nucleophile.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of ynamides, aryl diazonium salts, and aryl boronic acids for the synthesis of novel triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is described. This transformation represents the first example of an umpolung regioselective unsymmetrical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation/aryl&#8208;olefination of ynamides. The aryl moieties of the diazonium salt (electrophile) and boronic acid (nucleophile) are explicitly incorporated in the electrophilic &#945;&#8208; and nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;position, respectively, of the ynamide, resulting in a single isomer of the N&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted olefin. The scope is broad (68 examples), showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. DFT calculations substantiate the rationale of the mechanistic cycle and the regioselectivity. The chemoselectivity and synthetic potential of the enamide products were also studied.

      <title>Advances in the Interfacial Assembly of Mesoporous Silica on Magnetite Particles</title>
      <dc:description>
Multifaceted materials: Interface assembly enables the integration of magnetic particles and mesoporous materials to form advanced core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous materials for a variety of applications in catalysis, environmental remediation, and biomedicine. This Minireview summarizes progress made in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.







Abstract
Interfacing magnetic particles with ordered mesoporous materials is an effective direction for the development of functional porous composite materials with rationally designed core&#8211;shell structures. Owing to the combined properties of magnetic nanoparticles and mesoporous silica (high surface area, large pore volume, porosity, and biocompatibility), core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica materials have generated tremendous interest in various disciplines, including chemistry, materials, bioengineering, and biomedicine. Interfacial assembly strategies enable the rational construction of magnetic mesoporous silica materials with well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell structure, morphology, pore parameters, and surface wettability, which can decisively influence their physical and chemical properties and thus improve their application performance. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.

      <title>Molecular Photochemistry: Recent Developments in Theory</title>
      <dc:description>
More light in chemistry: This Minireview highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging techniques in theoretical and computational photochemistry. This is a challenging and rapidly evolving field that relates time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy with electronic structure theory and molecular dynamics for electronic excited states.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a fascinating branch of chemistry that is concerned with molecules and light. However, the importance of simulating light&#8208;induced processes is reflected also in fields as diverse as biology, material science, and medicine. This Minireview highlights recent progress achieved in theoretical chemistry to calculate electronically excited states of molecules and simulate their photoinduced dynamics, with the aim of reaching experimental accuracy. We focus on emergent methods and give selected examples that illustrate the progress in recent years towards predicting complex electronic structures with strong correlation, calculations on large molecules, describing multichromophoric systems, and simulating non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics over long time scales, for molecules in the gas phase or in complex biological environments.
