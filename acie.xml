         <title>Machine Learning Prediction of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Guest Accessibility from Linker and Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The choice of metal and linker together define the structure and therefore the guest accessibility of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), but the large number of possible metal&#8208;linker combinations makes the selection of components for synthesis challenging. We predict the guest accessibility of a MOF with 80.5% certainty based solely on the identity of these two components as chosen by the experimentalist, by decomposing reported experimental three&#8208;dimensional MOF structures in the Cambridge Structural Database into metal and linker and then learning the connection between the components&#8217; chemistry and the MOF porosity. Pore dimensions of the guest&#8208;accessible space are classified into four ranges with three sequential models. Both the dataset and the predictive models are available to download and offer simple guidance in prioritization of the choice of the components for exploratory MOF synthesis for separation and catalysis based on guest accessibility considerations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Peptide and Protein Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine reagents are commonly used for the development of novel transformations. As they are highly reactive and biocompatible, they have been employed more recently for the functionalization of biomolecules. This Minireview discusses the development of hypervalent iodine reagents for the modification of peptides and proteins as well as their application, such as for labeling and peptide stapling.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds are powerful reagents for the development of novel transformations. As they exhibit low toxicity, high functional group tolerance, and stability in biocompatible media, they have been used for the functionalization of biomolecules. Herein, we report recent advances up to June 2021 in peptide and protein modification using hypervalent iodine reagents. Their use as group transfer or oxidizing reagents is discussed in this Minireview, including methods targeting polar, aromatic, or aliphatic amino acids and peptide termini.

         <title>Thermal and Magnetic Field Switching in a Two&#8208;Step Hysteretic MnIII Spin Crossover Compound Coupled to Symmetry Breakings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new MnIII compound shows stepwise spin crossover (SCO) with two thermally hysteretic steps coupled to symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transitions. The superposition of two types of symmetry breakings leads to a rich interplay between structural and magnetic properties and stabilizes an unusual intermediate phase with four independent MnIII sites. Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced spin state switching at unprecedentedly low DC fields (onset &lt;5&#8197;T) is observed.







Abstract
A MnIII spin crossover complex with atypical two&#8208;step hysteretic thermal switching at 74&#8197;K and 84&#8197;K shows rich structural&#8211;magnetic interplay and magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced spin state switching below 14&#8197;T with an onset below 5&#8197;T. The spin states, structures, and the nature of the phase transitions are elucidated via X&#8208;ray and magnetization measurements. An unusual intermediate phase containing four individual sites, where 
 are in a pure low spin state, is observed. The splitting of equivalent sites in the high temperature phase into four inequivalent sites is due to a structural reorganization involving a primary and a secondary symmetry&#8208;breaking order parameter that induces a crystal system change from orthorhombic&#8594;monoclinic and a cell doubling. Further cooling leads to a reconstructive phase transition and a monoclinic low&#8208;temperature phase with two inequivalent low&#8208;spin sites. The coupling between the order parameters is identified in the framework of Landau theory.

         <title>Electrochemical Desaturative &#946;&#8208;Acylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a straightforward, robust, and simple route to access &#946;&#8208;substituted desaturated cyclic amines via an electrochemically driven desaturative &#946;&#8208;functionalization of cyclic amines. This transformation is based on multiple single&#8208;electron oxidation processes using catalytic amounts of ferrocene. The reaction proceeds in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of electrolyte under mild conditions, affording the desired products with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction was tolerant of a broad range of substrates and also enables late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of potentially valuable products. Prelininary mechanistic studies using cyclic voltammetry reveal the key role of ferrocene as a redox mediator in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathespin B&#8208;Initiated Cypate Nanoparticle Formation for Tumor Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cathepsin B (CTSB) is a lysosomal protease that is overexpressed in the early stage of many cancer types. Precise evaluation of CTSB expression in vivo may provide a promising method for the early diagnosis of cancers. By virtue of the high&#8208;resolution PA imaging modality, a &#8220;smart&#8221; photoacoustic (PA) probe Cypate&#8208;CBT, which can self&#8208;assemble to cypate&#8208;containing nanoparticles in response to abundant GSH and CTSB inside tumor cells, was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of CTSB activity. Compared with unmodified Cypate, our probe Cypate&#8208;CBT exhibited a 4.9&#8208;fold or 4.7&#8208;fold PA signal enhancement in CTSB&#8208;overexpressing MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells or tumors, respectively, revealing intracellular accumulation of the probe after CTSB&#8208;initiated self&#8208;assembly. We expect Cypate&#8208;CBT to be employed as an effective PA imaging agent for clinical diagnosis of cancer at early stages.</dc:description>

         <title>What Distinguishes the Strength and the Effect of a Lewis Acid: Analysis of the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What is the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett number? An experimental and theoretical evaluation of factors that determine the 31P&#8197;NMR shifts of binding of 130 Lewis acids to triethylphosphine oxide allows linking the strength of a Lewis acid (global Lewis acidity) with the effect of a Lewis acid (effective Lewis acidity).







Abstract
IUPAC defines Lewis acidity as the thermodynamic tendency for Lewis pair formation. This strength property was recently specified as global Lewis acidity (gLA), and is gauged for example by the fluoride ion affinity. Experimentally, Lewis acidity is usually evaluated by the effect on a bound molecule, such as the induced 31P&#8197;NMR shift of triethylphosphine oxide in the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett (GB) method. This type of scaling was called effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Unfortunately, gLA and eLA often correlate poorly, but a reason for this is unknown. Hence, the strength and the effect of a Lewis acid are two distinct properties, but they are often granted interchangeably. The present work analyzes thermodynamic, NMR specific, and London dispersion effects on GB numbers for 130 Lewis acids by theory and experiment. The deformation energy of a Lewis acid is identified as the prime cause for the critical deviation between gLA and eLA but its correction allows a unification for the first time.

An experimental and theoretical evaluation of factors that determine the &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P&#8197;NMR shifts of binding of 130 Lewis acids to triethylphosphine oxide allows linking the strength of a Lewis acid (global Lewis acidity) with the effect of a Lewis acid (effective Lewis acidity).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IUPAC defines Lewis acidity as the thermodynamic tendency for Lewis pair formation. This strength property was recently specified as global Lewis acidity (gLA), and is gauged for example by the fluoride ion affinity. Experimentally, Lewis acidity is usually evaluated by the effect on a bound molecule, such as the induced &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P&#8197;NMR shift of triethylphosphine oxide in the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett (GB) method. This type of scaling was called effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Unfortunately, gLA and eLA often correlate poorly, but a reason for this is unknown. Hence, the strength and the effect of a Lewis acid are two distinct properties, but they are often granted interchangeably. The present work analyzes thermodynamic, NMR specific, and London dispersion effects on GB numbers for 130 Lewis acids by theory and experiment. The deformation energy of a Lewis acid is identified as the prime cause for the critical deviation between gLA and eLA but its correction allows a unification for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amides via Highly Chemoselective N&#8211;C&#160;Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although cross&#8208;coupling reactions of amides by selective N&#8211;C cleavage are one of the most powerful and burgeoning areas in organic synthesis due to the ubiquity of amide bonds, the development of mechanochemical, solid state methods remain a major challenge. Herein, we report the first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8211;C bond activation. The method is conducted in the absence of external heating, for short rection time and shows excellent chemoselectivity for s N&#8211;C bond activation. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs and sequential orthogonal cross&#8208;couplings exploiting double solvent&#8208;less solid&#8208;state methods. The results further mechanochemical reaction environments to advance the chemical repertoire of N&#8211;C bond interconversions to solid&#8208;state environmentally&#8208;friendly mechanochemical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallization&#8208;Prompted Robust Porphyrin&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under the topological guidance, the self&#8208;assembly process based on tetratopic porphyrin synthon results in a HOF with the predicted square layers topology (sql) but unsatisfied stability. Strikingly, simply introducing transition metal in porphyrin center does not change the network topology but drastically causes noticeable change on noncovalent interaction, orbital overlap, and molecular geometry, therefore ultimately giving rise to a series of metalloporphyrinic HOFs with high surface area, and excellent stability (intact after being soaked in boiling water, concentrated HCl, and heated in 270 oC). With integrating both photosensitizers and catalytic sites into robust backbones, this series of HOFs can effectively catalyze the photoreduction of CO2 to CO, and their catalytic performances greatly depend on the chelated metal species in porphyrin centers. This work enriches the library of stable functional HOFs and expands their applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Regioisomeric Space and Visible Color Range of Purely Organic Dual Emitters with Ultralong Phosphorescence Components: From Violet to Red Towards Pure White Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative set of twelve highly luminescent dual emitters based on benzensulfone moieties selectively attached to dibenzofurane is presented. These compounds can cover the whole visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and even behave as single&#8208;source white light emitters. They show ultralong phosphorescent afterglow at room temperature, based on the positioning of the sulfone moieties.







Abstract
We mapped the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum and achieved white light emission (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) by combining the intrinsic ns&#8208;fluorescence with ultralong ms&#8208;phosphorescence from purely organic dual emitters. We realized small molecular materials showing high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;L) in the solid state at room temperature, achieved by active exploration of the regioisomeric substitution space. Chromophore stacking&#8208;supported stabilization of triplet excitons with assistance from enhanced intersystem crossing channels in the crystalline state played the primary role for the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. This strategy covers the entire visible spectrum, based on organic phosphorescent emitters with versatile regioisomeric substitution patterns, and provides a single molecular source of white light with long lifetime (up to 163.5&#8197;ms) for the phosphorescent component, and high overall photoluminescence quantum yields (up to &#934;L=20&#8201;%).

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Copper Catalysis for the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state copper catalysis enables the synthesis of more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs.







Abstract
Heterocycles are one of the largest groups of organic moieties with significant medicinal, chemical, and industrial applications. Herein, we report the discovery and development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, synergistic excited&#8208;state copper catalysis using a combination of Cu(IPr)I as a catalyst and rac&#8208;BINAP as a ligand, which produces more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs. Preliminary mechanistic investigation suggests in situ generations of [Cu(BINAP)2]+ and [Cu(IPr)2]+ catalysts that work cooperatively under visible&#8208;light irradiation to facilitate catalytic carbo&#8208;aroylation of unactivated alkenes, affording a wide range of useful heterocycles.

Abstract
SuFEx click chemistry is a powerful method designed for the selective, rapid, and modular synthesis of functional molecules. Classical SuFEx reactions form stable S&#8722;O linkages upon exchange of S&#8722;F bonds with aryl silyl&#8208;ether substrates, and while near&#8208;perfect in their outcome, are sometimes disadvantaged by relatively high catalyst loadings and prolonged reaction times. We herein report the development of accelerated SuFEx click chemistry (ASCC), an improved SuFEx method for the efficient and catalytic coupling of aryl and alkyl alcohols with a range of SuFExable hubs. We demonstrate Barton's hindered guanidine base (2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine; BTMG) as a superb SuFEx catalyst that, when used in synergy with silicon additive hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), yields stable S&#8722;O bond linkages in a single step; often within minutes. The powerful combination of BTMG and HMDS reagents allows for catalyst loadings as low as 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% and, in congruence with click&#8208;principles, provides a scalable method that is safe, efficient, and practical for modular synthesis. ASSC expands the number of accessible SuFEx products and will find significant application in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science.

&lt;p&gt;We report accelerated SuFEx click chemistry utilizing a synergistic BTMG-HMDS catalytic system. The power and versatility of the reaction are showcased by the SuFEx synthesis of &amp;gt;100 unique molecules from diverse SuFExable hubs. Accelerated SuFEx is a next generation click reaction that improves upon existing protocols and expands the scope of accessible products.

         <title>A Modular Approach to the Antifungal Sphingofungin Family: Concise Total Synthesis of Sphingofungin&#8197;A and&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short and flexible total synthesis of antifungal and antiparasitic sphingofungins&#8197;A&#8211;D and congeners was developed by combining a versatile decarboxylative coupling reaction and a cross metathesis protocol.







Abstract
Sphingofungins are fungal natural products known to inhibit the biosynthesis of sphingolipids which play pivotal roles in various cell functions. Here, we report a short and flexible synthetic approach towards the sphingofungin family. Key step of the synthesis was a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of chiral sulfinyl imines with a functionalized tartaric acid derivative, which yielded the core motif of sphingofungins carrying four consecutive stereocenters and a terminal double bond. Subsequent metathesis reaction allowed for the introduction of different side chains of choice resulting in a total of eight sphingofungins, including for the first time sphingofungin&#8197;C (eight steps from commercially available protected tartaric acid with an overall yield of 6&#8201;%) and sphingofungin&#8197;A (ten steps). All newly synthesized derivatives were tested for their antifungal, cell&#8208;proliferative and antiparasitic activity unraveling their structure&#8211;activity relations.

         <title>Be&#8211;Be &#960;&#8208;Bonding and Predicted Superconductivity in MBe2 (M=Zr, Hf)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beryllium in ZrBe2 and HfBe2 forms a honeycomb network of &#960; bonds. Both materials are valence isoelectronic and isostructural to MgB2, and like that compound, are predicted to be superconductors. Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, shows here that it may construct networks of low dimensionality by virtue of its ability to engage in &#960; bonding. Until now, this property was exclusively associated with elements from the p&#8208;block.







Abstract
Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, forms an aromatic network of delocalized Be&#8211;Be &#960; bonds in alloys ZrBe2 and HfBe2. This gives rise to stacked [Be2]4&#8722; layers with tetravalent cations in between. The [Be2]4&#8722; sublattice is isoelectronic and isostructural to graphite, as well as the [B]&#8722;2 sublattice in MgB2, and it bears identical manifestations of &#960; bonding in its electronic band structure. These come in the form of degeneracies at K and H in the Brillouin zone, separated in energy as the result of interlayer orbital interactions. Zr and Hf use their valence d orbitals to form bonds with the layers, leading to nearly identical band structures. Like MgB2, ZrBe2 and HfBe2 are computed to be phonon&#8208;mediated superconductors at ambient pressures, with respective critical temperatures of 11.4&#8197;K and 8.8&#8197;K. The coupling strength between phonons and free electrons is very similar, so that the difference in critical temperatures is controlled by the mass of constituent interlayer ions.

         <title>Cutting COF&#8208;like C4N into Colloidal Quantum Dots toward Optical Encryption and Bidirectional Sulfur Chemistry via Functional Group and Edge Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a newly&#8208;emerged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered polymer, C  4  N has aroused increasing interest. Yet, the inferior solubility of bulk C  4  N constrains its application scope.&#160;Nanostructing bulk C  4  N into quantum dots (QDs) can enable enhanced or entirely&#8208;new properties, but the C  4  NQDs study remains unavailable. Here, starting from predesigned COF&#8208;like C  4  N, we report the first synthesis of colloidal C  4  NQDs and their functional composites, and explore their optical activities for dual&#8208;mode information encryption and edge&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;catalytic ability toward boosted sulfur chemistry in Li&#8208;S cells. Colloidal C  4  NQDs with ultrasmall size of ~2.2 nm bear rich carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating intriguing functionalities by exploiting functional group and edge effects of QDs. While C  4  NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites attain color&#8208;tunable afterglow and FL/room&#8208;temperature &#8208; phosphorescence (RTP) dual&#8208;mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution as a new encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a robust barrier layer to decorate commercial separators and afford superior polysulfide adsorption&#8208;catalysis ability, endowing a Li&#8208;S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability and large areal capacity of 5.8 mAh cm  &#8722;2  at high sulfur loading of 7.2 mg cm  &#8208;2  . Computation and experiment studies unveil that edge sites in C  4  N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis relative to in&#8208;plane sites and the synergy of enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs expedites bidirectional catalytic conversion of sulfur species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8208;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups (P&#8208;R: R=&#8208;CN, &#8208;CO2Et, &#8208;Me, &#8208;CF3) and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) are constructed to exhibit tunable second&#8208;level (from 0.9 seconds to 2.2 seconds) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in amorphous state. Compared with other solid supramolecules P&#8208;R/CB[7] (R=&#8208;CN, &#8208;CO2Et, &#8208;Me), P&#8208;CF3/CB[7] displays the longest lifetime (2.2 seconds), which is probably attributed to the fluorophilic interaction of cucurbiturils leading to stronger host&#8208;guest interaction between 4&#8208;penylpyridium with &#8211;CF3 and CB[7]. Furthermore, the RTP solid supramolecular assembly (donors) can further fabricate with organic dyes Eosin Y or SR101 (acceptors) to form ternary supramolecular systems featuring the ultralong phosphorescence energy transfer (PpET) and visible delayed fluorescence (yellow for EY at 568 nm and red for SR101 at 620 nm). Significantly, the ultralong multicolor PpET supramolecular assembly can be further applied in fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption and painting.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Responsive Jamming of Nanoparticle Dense Suspensions towards Macroscopic Liquid&#8211;Solid Switchable Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a thermo&#8208;responsive jamming of SPNPs dense suspensions for obtaining macroscopic smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs.







Abstract
Nanoparticle aggregation for constructing functional materials has shown enormous advantages in various applications. Most efforts focused on ordered nanoparticle aggregation for specific functions but were often limited to irreversible aggregation processes due to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Herein, we report a reversible disordered aggregation of SiO2&#8208;PNIPAAm nanoparticles (SPNPs) through thermo&#8208;responsive jamming, obtaining smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials. The smart materials can display a switch between liquid&#8208;like state and solid&#8208;like state responding to a temperature change. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs. Notably, the materials at the solid&#8208;like state show anti&#8208;impact properties and can withstand the impact of a steel sphere with a speed of 328&#8197;cm&#8201;s&#8722;1. We envision that this finding offers inspiration to design smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials for impact protection.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Li&#8722;CO2 Battery Enabled by Carbon Nanotube/Carbon Nitride Heterostructured Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon nanotube/carbon nitride heterostructured photocathode is designed to efficiently utilize photo&#8208;energy to boost sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution kinetics of the Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The resulting Li&#8722;CO2 battery achieves a record&#8208;high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, superior cycling stability with high efficiency retention of 86.1&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh areal capacity of 15.77&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries are explored as promising power systems to alleviate environmental issues and to implement space applications. However, sluggish cathode kinetics of CO2 reduction/evolution result in low round&#8208;trip efficiency and poor cycling stability of the fabricated energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, we design a heterostructued photocathode comprising carbon nanotube and carbon nitride to accelerate cathode reactions of a Li&#8722;CO2 battery under illumination. Benefiting from the unique defective structure of carbon nitride and favorable interfacial charge transfer, the photocathode effectively harvests ultraviolet&#8208;visible light to generate abundant photoexcited carriers and coordinates energetic photoelectrons/holes to participate in the discharge/charge reactions, leading to efficient photo&#8208;energy utilization in decreasing reaction barriers and enhancing thermodynamic reversibility of Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The resulting battery delivers a high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8&#8201;% (ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.04&#8197;V) and superior cycling stability (86.1&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles).

         <title>The Chiral Target of Daptomycin Is the 2R,2&#8242;S Stereoisomer of Phosphatidylglycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Daptomycin (dap), an important clinical antibiotic, recognizes the absolute configuration of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a key lipid found in bacterial membranes. The configuration at the headgroup of PG was found to be particularly important for dap&#8211;PG interactions. This is a rare example of a natural product targeting a membrane lipid through chiral recognition.







Abstract
Daptomycin (dap) is an important antibiotic that interacts with the bacterial membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in a calcium&#8208;dependent manner. The enantiomer of dap (ent&#8208;dap) was synthesized and was found to be 85&#8208;fold less active than dap against B. subtilis, indicating that dap interacts with a chiral target as part of its mechanism of action. Using liposomes containing enantiopure PG, we demonstrate that the binding of dap to PG, the structural transition that occurs upon dap binding to PG, and the subsequent oligomerization of dap, depends upon the configuration of PG, and that dap prefers the 1,2&#8208;diacyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;sn&#8208;glycerol stereoisomer (2R,2&#8242;S configuration). Ent&#8208;dap has a lower affinity for 2R,2&#8242;S liposomes than dap and cannot oligomerize to the same extent as dap, which accounts for why ent&#8208;dap is less active than dap. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby the activity of an antibiotic depends upon the configuration of a lipid head group.

         <title>Bulky Cyclometalated Ruthenium Nitrates for Challenging Z&#8208;Selective Metathesis: Efficient One&#8208;Step Access to &#945;&#8208;Oxygenated Z&#8208;Olefins from Acrylates and Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent challenge in olefin metathesis is the lack of widely applicable method that converts feedstock allyl alcohols and acylates to valuable &#945;&#8208;oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins. Here, enabled by bulky cyclometalated Ru&#8208;nitrate catalysts whose syntheses were newly unlocked, Z&#8208;selective metathesis between terminal olefins could now be used to access Z&#8208;allyl alcohols, Z&#8208;alkenyl esters, and Z&#8208;alkenyl acids in high yields and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules and serve as versatile handles for organic synthesis, but their syntheses are often tedious and less selective. Here we report the efficient Z&#8208;selective metathesis of various terminal acrylates and allyl alcohols, which enables facile and selective construction of high value&#8208;added &#945;&#8208;oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins from readily available feedstock chemicals. These challenging metathesis transformations are enabled by novel cyclometalated Ru&#8208;carbene&#8208;nitrate complexes bearing bulky&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible side arms, whose assembly was unlocked by new organometallic syntheses.

         <title>Maximizing Step&#8208;Normalized Increases in Molecular Complexity: Formal [4+2+2+2] Photoinduced Cyclization Cascade to Access Polyheterocycles Possessing Privileged Substructures</title>

         <dc:description>
Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in aromatic o&#8208;amino ketones with tethered dual unsaturated pendants, i.e. pyrrole and alkenic moieties, initiates a complexity building photoinduced cascade of an unprecedented formal [4+2+2+2] topology, resulting in the formation of four &#963;&#8208;bonds and setting six new stereogenic centers in a single photochemical step with up to 220&#8197;mcbit complexity increases.







Abstract
A new complexity building photoinduced cascade which amounts to an unprecedented formal [4+2+2+2] cycloaddition topology is developed to access complex nitrogen polyheterocycles. This photocascade is initiated by the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in aromatic amino ketones with tethered dual unsaturated pendants, i.e. pyrrole and alkenic moieties, resulting in the formation of four &#963;&#8208;bonds and setting six new stereogenic centers in a single experimentally simple photochemical step with up to 220&#8197;mcbit complexity increases.

         <title>Controlling Syneresis of Hydrogels Using Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For self&#8208;shrinkable hydrogels, syneresis can be controlled by tuning the hydrophobic microenvironment within the gel network involving co&#8208;assembly with organic salts.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels can spontaneously undergo syneresis through fibre&#8211;fibre interactions and expel significant amounts of water upon aging. In this process, the hydrophobicity of fibres which regulates the 3D&#8208;rearrangement of the self&#8208;assembled structures during syneresis is important. Here, we show that we can control the hydrophobic microenvironment of gels by incorporating organic salts into the co&#8208;assembled gel fibres thereby enabling control of the macroscopic gel volume phase transition.

         <title>Optimizing Hydrogen Binding on Ru Sites with RuCo Alloy Nanosheets for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing Ru&#8722;H adsorption/desorption efficiency, via adjusting the Ru 
 orbital in RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets, enables highly promoted alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. This optimized adsorption/desorption efficiency is demonstrated by the hydrogen sensor and temperature program desorption experiments. The RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets possess a record low overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to the commercial Pt/C and Ru/C.







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, with considerable performance and desirable cost, are becoming highly interesting candidates to replace platinum (Pt) in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hydrogen binding at Ru sites (Ru&#8722;H) is an important factor limiting the HER activity. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that the essence of Ru&#8722;H binding energy is the strong interaction between the 
 orbital of Ru and the 1s orbital of H. The charge transfer between Ru sites and substrates (Co and Ni) causes the appropriate downward shift of the 
&#8208;band center of Ru, which results in a Gibbs free energy of 0.022&#8197;eV for H* in the RuCo system, much lower than the 0.133&#8197;eV in the pure Ru system. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally confirmed using RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets (RuCo ANSs). They were prepared via a fast co&#8208;precipitation method followed with a mild electrochemical reduction. Structure characterizations reveal that the Ru atoms are embedded into the Co substrate as isolated active sites with a planar symmetric and Z&#8208;direction asymmetric coordination structure, obtaining an optimal 
 modulated electronic structure. Hydrogen sensor and temperature program desorption (TPD) tests demonstrate the enhanced Ru&#8722;H interactions in RuCo ANSs compared to those in pure Ru nanoparticles. As a result, the RuCo ANSs reach an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 20.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C. This holistic work provides a new insight to promote alkaline HER by optimizing the metal&#8208;H binding energy of active sites.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation</title>

According to DFT calculations, the localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to an unprecedented site&#8208;specific hydrogenation process at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the helicene backbone.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dithia[5]helicenes and their Post&#8208;synthetic Functionalization to Access Dithia[9]helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: A highly enantioselective synthesis of 5,13&#8208;disubstituted dibenzo[d,d&#8217;]benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophenes is reported.

         <title>Dianion and Dication of Tetracyclopentatetraphenylene as Decoupled Annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;Annulene Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dianion and dication of tetramesityl&#8208;substituted tetracyclopentatetraphenylene, a circulene consisting of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings, have been generated by reduction with alkali metals and oxidation with antimony(V) halides, respectively. They are theoretically predicted to adopt double annulenoid structures called annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;annulene models in which the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled. The theoretical structures were experimentally proven by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses and the electronic configurations were supported by MCD spectra. Based on the  13  C NMR chemical shifts, negative and positive charges are shown to be located mainly at the outer periphery, indicating that the dianion and dication have delocalized 22&#8208;&#960; and 18&#8208;&#960; electron outer perimeters, respectively, and 8&#8208;&#960; electron structure at the inner ring. Notably, the dianion has an open&#8208;shell character whereas the dication has a closed&#8208;shell ground state.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Multiple Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions by Tunable DNA Scaffold Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulation of cell&#8208;cell interactions via cell surface engineering has potential biomedical applications in tissue engineering&#160;and&#160;cell therapy. However, manipulation of the comprehensive and multiple intercellular interactions&#160;remain a challenge and missing elements. Herein, utilizing DNA triangular prism (TP) and branched polymer (BP) as functional modules, we fabricate tunable DNA scaffold networks&#160;on cell surface. The responsiveness of cell&#8208;cell recognition, aggregation and dissociation could be modulated by aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA scaffold networks with high accuracy and specificity. By regulating the DNA scaffold networks coated on cell surface, the controlled intercellular molecular transportation is achieved. Our tunable network provides a simple and extendible strategy which addresses a current need in cell surface engineering to precisely manipulate cell&#8208;cell interactions and shows a promise as a general tool for controllable cell behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Nitric Acid from Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric acid has been widely applied in agriculture and industries. The present manufacturing process via a combination of the Haber&#8208;Bosch process and the Ostwald oxidation process is accompanied by massive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. A direct electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitric acid is a promising alternative, especially when it is driven by renewable energy sources. The standardization of performance evaluation is the premise for the design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for NOR. In this regard, this review first discusses the history of the development of HNO  3  manufacturing and the possible reaction mechanisms for electrocatalytic NOR. Then, a strict protocol for electrochemical NOR experiments is recommended. Finally, general research targets associated with techno&#8208;economic analysis, challenges, and prospects for NOR are summarized for future studies.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging, especially fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, possesses non&#8208;invasiveness, high spatial and temporal resolution, and high sensitivity, etc., compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the merits from the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window imaging, like deeper penetration depth, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, high resolution, and low tissue damage, researchers devote great efforts to develop contrast agents with NIR&#8208;II absorption or emission. In this review, we summarized recently developed organic luminescent and photoacoustic materials, ranging from small molecules to conjugated polymers. Then, we systematically introduced engineering strategies and their imaging performance, classified by the skeleton cores. Finally, we elucidated the challenges and prospective of these NIR&#8208;II organic dyes for potential clinical applications. We hope our summary can inspire further development of NIR&#8208;II contrast agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Regulation of Defect Sites and Vertical Conduction by Spiral Domain for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insufficient active sites and weak vertical conduction are the intrinsic factors that restrict the electrocatalytic HER for transition metal dichalcogenides  . As a prototype, we proposed a model of spiral MoTe  2  to optimize collectively above issues. The conductive atomic force microscopy of an individual spiral reveal the retentive vertical conduction irrespective of layer thickness benefiting from the connected screw dislocation lines between interlayers. Theoretical calculation uncover that the regions near the edges step of spiral structures are more easily to form Te vacancies and have lower &#916;G  H  * as extra active sites. A single spiral MoTe  2  &#8208;based on&#8208;chip microcell was fabricated to extract HER activity and achieved ultrahigh current density of 3000 mA cm  &#8208;2  at the overpotential of 0.4 V, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the exfoliated counterpart. Profoundly, this funny spiral model will initiate a new pathway for triggering other inert catalytic reaction</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetrical&#8208;Dendronized TADF Emitters for Efficient Non&#8208;doped Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs by Eliminating Degenerate Excited States and Creating Solely Thermal Equilibrium Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in dendrimers is not clear.   We report that fully&#8208;conjugated or fully&#8208;nonconjugated structures cause unwanted degenerate excited states due to multiple identical dendrons, which limit their TADF efficiency.    We have synthesized asymmetrical &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8208;half&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; emitters.   By eliminating degenerate excited states, the triplet locally excited state is &#8805; 0.3 eV above the lowest triplet charge&#8208;transfer state, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin&#8208;flip process. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit can protect the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay and enhancing  TADF performance. Non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed devices reach high external quantum efficiency (EQE  max  ) of 24.0% (65.9 cd/A, 59.2 lm/W) with CIE coordinates of (0.24, 0.45) with low efficiency roll&#8208;off and EQEs of 23.6% and 21.3% at 100 and 500 cd/m  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Pyridylation of Hydroxamates through Direct Photoexcitation of O&#8208;Aryl Oxime Pyridinium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26813-26821, December 13, 2021. </description>

Remote C&#8208;H pyridylation of hydroxamates was developed by designing a new class of photon&#8208;absorbing O&#8208;aryl oxime pyridinium salts generated in&#8197;situ from the corresponding pyridines and hydroxamates. This method involves photolytic N&#8722;O bond cleavage through the photoexcitation of oxime pyridinium intermediates to generate iminyl radicals, which enable the installation of pyridyl rings at the &#947;&#8208;CN position in complex settings under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient strategy for the remote C&#8722;H pyridylation of hydroxamates with excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity by designing a new class of photon&#8208;absorbing O&#8208;aryl oxime pyridinium salts generated in situ from the corresponding pyridines and hydroxamates. When irradiated by visible light, the photoexcitation of oxime pyridinium intermediates generates iminyl radicals via the photolytic N&#8722;O bond cleavage, which does not require an external photocatalyst. The efficiency of light absorption and N&#8722;O bond cleavage of the oxime pyridinium salts can be modulated through the electronic effect of substitution on the O&#8208;aryl ring. The resultant iminyl radicals enable the installation of pyridyl rings at the &#947;&#8208;CN position, which yields synthetically valuable C2&#8208;substituted pyridyl derivatives. This novel synthetic approach provides significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and simplicity and exhibits broad functional group tolerance in complex settings under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Targetable Conformationally Restricted Cyanines Enable Photon&#8208;Count&#8208;Limited Applications**
</title>

Modern fluorescence&#8208;based methods put intense demands on probe molecules. Here we report conformationally restrained cyanines suitable for biomolecule labeling. These efforts establish contexts in which reduced cyanine isomerization leads to a significant enhance in photon output.







Abstract
Cyanine dyes are exceptionally useful probes for a range of fluorescence&#8208;based applications, but their photon output can be limited by trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis photoisomerization. We recently demonstrated that appending a ring system to the pentamethine cyanine ring system improves the quantum yield and extends the fluorescence lifetime. Here, we report an optimized synthesis of persulfonated variants that enable efficient labeling of nucleic acids and proteins. We demonstrate that a bifunctional sulfonated tertiary amide significantly improves the optical properties of the resulting bioconjugates. These new conformationally restricted cyanines are compared to the parent cyanine derivatives in a range of contexts. These include their use in the plasmonic hotspot of a DNA&#8208;nanoantenna, in single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications, far&#8208;red fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). These efforts define contexts in which eliminating cyanine isomerization provides meaningful benefits to imaging performance.

         <title>IrOx@In2O3 Heterojunction from Individually Crystallized Oxides for Weak&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26790-26797, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
During heterogeneous nucleation for the formation of the IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction, IrOx and In2O3 are observed to crystallize independently. This crystallization avoids Ir loss and ensures that all Ir&#8208;based sites are fully exposed. More importantly, surface&#8208;exposed nano&#8208;sized IrOx can be 100&#8201;% activated by weak&#8208;light (1.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) irradiation, which can enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work focuses on the importance of multi&#8208;field coupling for promoting OER performance.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;field coupling, especially photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysis, has recently been studied to further improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, an n&#8208;type cubic In2O3 semiconductor is employed for the first time to load IrOx species (Ir&#8208;In2O3 mass ratio: 17.6&#8201;%). Consequently, the IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction, which exhibits outstanding OER performance promoted by weak&#8208;light irradiation, is formed. Notably, IrOx (approximately 1.7&#8197;nm in size) and In2O3 are observed to crystallize independently during heterogeneous nucleation with no Ir atoms doped in the In2O3 lattice. This avoids Ir loss and ensures the full exposure of all Ir&#8208;based sites. The IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation with overpotential values of 190 and 231&#8197;mV at current densities of 10 and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing all IrOx&#8208;based catalyst results reported to date. Nano&#8208;sized IrOx on the surface, irradiated by the weak&#8208;light beam of LED&#8208;365 (1.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), can be fully activated as an OER site. Moreover, the overpotential is further reduced to 176 and 210&#8197;mV to deliver the corresponding current. This work is anticipated to aid in the design of more efficient multi&#8208;field coupling OER systems.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Functionalization with d0 Early Transition Metals Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26630-26638, December 13, 2021. </description>

This study reports a general class of electrocatalysts covering the majority of early transition metals for ambient methane functionalization. The broad applicability of this discovery offers fundamental insights and new opportunities for natural gas utilization.







Abstract
The undesirable loss of methane (CH4) at remote locations welcomes approaches that ambiently functionalize CH4 on&#8208;site without intense infrastructure investment. Recently, we found that electrochemical oxidation of vanadium(V)&#8208;oxo with bisulfate ligand leads to CH4 activation at ambient conditions. The key question is whether such an observation is a one&#8208;off coincidence or a general strategy for electrocatalyst design. Here, a general scheme of electrocatalytic CH4 activation with d0 early transition metals is established. The pre&#8208;catalysts&#8217; molecular structure, electrocatalytic kinetics, and mechanism were detailed for titanium&#8197;(IV), vanadium&#8197;(V), and chromium&#8197;(VI) species as model systems. After a turnover&#8208;limiting one&#8208;electron electrochemical oxidation, the yielded ligand&#8208;centered cation radicals activate CH4 with low activation energy and high selectivity. The reactivities are universal among early transition metals from Period 4 to 6, and the reactivities trend for different early transition metals correlate with their d orbital energies across periodic table. Our results offer new chemical insights towards developing advanced ambient electrocatalysts of natural gas.

By combining advanced spectroscopies (IR and solid&#8208;state NMR) and molecular modeling, this work reveals the presence of a proton transfer from the sodalite cage to the supercage of USY&#8197;zeolite. When a basic probe molecule is in close proximity, the protonation is first assured by a &#8220;gate&#8208;keeper&#8221; silanol, which is restored by a proton transfer from the Br&#248;nsted acid site located deeper in the sodalite cage.







Abstract
Zeolite&#8197;Y and its ultra&#8208;stabilized hierarchical derivative (USY) are the most widely used zeolite&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts in oil refining, petrochemisty, and other chemicals manufacturing. After almost 60&#8197;years of academic and industrial research, their resilience is unique as no other catalyst displaced them from key processes such as FCC and hydrocracking. The present study highlights the key difference leading to the exceptional catalytic performance of USY versus the parent zeolite&#8197;Y in a multi&#8208;technique study combining advanced spectroscopies (IR and solid&#8208;state NMR) and molecular modeling. The results highlight a hitherto unreported proton transfer involving inaccessible active sites in sodalite cages that contributes to the exceptional catalytic performance of USY.

         <title>Dimensionality Control of Inorganic and Hybrid Perovskite Nanocrystals by Reaction Temperature: From No&#8208;Confinement to 3D and 1D Quantum Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26677-26684, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of both inorganic and hybrid halide perovskite nanocrystals is tunable from 3D nanocubes with no&#8208;confinement to 0D nanocubes and 2D nanoplatelets with 3D and 1D&#8208;quantum confinement, respectively by a decrease of the reaction temperature in the hot&#8208;plate approach under inert gas&#8208;free conditions. The synthesis is scalable, and their halide composition is tunable by simply using different combinations of precursor stock solutions.







Abstract
This work focuses on the systematic investigation of the shape, size, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) under inert gas&#8208;free conditions and using pre&#8208;synthesized precursor stock solutions. In the case of CsPbBr3 NCs, we find that the lowering of reaction temperature from &#8764;175 to 100&#8201;&#176;C initially leads to a change of morphology from bulk&#8208;like 3D nanocubes to 0D nanocubes with 3D&#8208;quantum confinement, while at temperatures below 100&#8201;&#176;C the reaction yields 2D nanoplatelets (NPls) with 1D&#8208;quantum confinement. However, to our surprise, at higher temperatures (&#8764;215&#8201;&#176;C), the reaction yields CsPbBr3 hexapod NCs, which have been rarely reported. The synthesis is scalable, and their halide composition is tunable by simply using different combinations of precursor solutions. The versatility of the synthesis is demonstrated by applying it to relatively less explored shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of FAPbBr3 NCs. Despite the synthesis carried out in the air, both the inorganic and hybrid perovskite NCs exhibit nearly&#8208;narrow emission without applying any size&#8208;selective separation, and it is precisely tunable by controlling the reaction temperature.

         <title>Evolution of Cationic Vacancy Defects: A Motif for Surface Restructuration of OER Precatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26829-26836, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Along with increasing voltage during the OER process, the structural evolution of cationic defects within NiFe&#8208;LDH, where the simple vacancy VM changes to VMOH and then to the most reactive VMOH&#8208;H, and the surface restructuration, where surface crystalline Ni(OH)x is converted to disordered Ni(OH)x and then to the surface local NiOOH species, are voltage&#8208;regulated concurrent events defining the eventual catalytic performance of the precatalyst.







Abstract
Defects have been found to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe&#8208;LDH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, their specific configuration and the role played in regulating the surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts remain ambiguous. Herein, cationic vacancy defects are generated via aprotic&#8208;solvent&#8208;solvation&#8208;induced leaking of metal cations from NiFe&#8208;LDH nanosheets. DFT calculation and in situ Raman spectroscopic observation both reveal that the as&#8208;generated cationic vacancy defects tend to exist as VM (M=Ni/Fe); under increasing applied voltage, they tend to assume the configuration VMOH, and eventually transform into VMOH&#8208;H which is the most active yet most difficult to form thermodynamically. Meanwhile, with increasing voltage the surface crystalline Ni(OH)x in the NiFe&#8208;LDH is gradually converted into disordered status; under sufficiently high voltage when oxygen bubbles start to evolve, local NiOOH species become appearing, which is the residual product from the formation of vacancy VMOH&#8208;H. Thus, we demonstrate that the cationic defects evolve along with increasing applied voltage (VM &#8594; VMOH &#8594; VMOH&#8208;H), and reveal the essential motif for the surface restructuration process of NiFe&#8208;LDH (crystalline Ni(OH)x &#8594; disordered Ni(OH)x &#8594; NiOOH). Our work provides insight into defect&#8208;induced surface restructuration behaviors of NiFe&#8208;LDH as a typical precatalyst for efficient OER electrocatalysis.

         <title>Deciphering and Suppressing Over&#8208;Oxidized Nitrogen in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26656-26662, December 13, 2021. </description>

A systematic investigation of the nitrogen network during the nickel&#8208;catalyzed urea oxidation reaction was carefully performed. It revealed a dominant NO2&#8722; production rather than innocuous N2 present on various nickel&#8208;based catalysts. Accordingly, polymer&#8208;surface modification was put forward to increase the efficiency of harmless N2 products.







Abstract
Urea electrolysis is a prospective technology for simultaneous H2 production and nitrogen suppression in the process of water being used for energy production. Its sustainability is currently founded on innocuous N2 products; however, we discovered that prevalent nickel&#8208;based catalysts could generally over&#8208;oxidize urea into NO2&#8722; products with &#8776;80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazards to the environment. Trace amounts of over&#8208;oxidized NO3&#8722; and N2O were also detected. Using 15N isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen&#8208;fate network involving a NO2&#8722;&#8208;formation pathway via OH&#8722;&#8208;assisted C&#8722;N cleavage and two N2&#8208;formation pathways via intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling. DFT calculations confirmed that C&#8722;N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline&#8208;coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for increasing N2 production by a factor of two. These findings provide complementary insights into the nitrogen fate in water&#8211;energy nexus systems.

         <title>Identification of Inhibitors of Cholesterol Transport Proteins Through the Synthesis of a Diverse, Sterol&#8208;Inspired Compound Collection</title>

A general strategy for the identification of selective cholesterol transport protein inhibitors through the synthesis of a diverse sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection is presented. Fusion of a primary sterol scaffold to diverse secondary natural product&#8208;derived scaffolds afforded hits against all of the Aster family of cholesterol transport proteins and selective inhibitors of Aster&#8208;C.







Abstract
Cholesterol transport proteins regulate a vast array of cellular processes including lipid metabolism, vesicular and non&#8208;vesicular trafficking, organelle contact sites, and autophagy. Despite their undoubted importance, the identification of selective modulators of this class of proteins has been challenging due to the structural similarities in the cholesterol&#8208;binding site. Herein we report a general strategy for the identification of selective inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins via the synthesis of a diverse sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection. Fusion of a primary sterol fragment to an array of secondary privileged scaffolds led to the identification of potent and selective inhibitors of the cholesterol transport protein Aster&#8208;C, which displayed a surprising preference for the unnatural&#8208;sterol AB&#8208;ring stereochemistry and new inhibitors of Aster&#8208;A. We propose that this strategy can and should be applied to any therapeutically relevant sterol&#8208;binding protein.

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Glutarimides: Alternative Cereblon Binders for the Design of PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26663-26670, December 13, 2021. </description>

IMiD&#8208;based PROTACs rapidly hydrolyze in commonly utilized cell media, which significantly affects their cell efficacy. We designed novel BET PROTACs based on phenyl glutarimide (PG) and showed that they retained affinity for CRBN and displayed improved chemical stability. To demonstrate the utility of PG&#8208;based PROTACs we developed SJ995973 (4&#8201;c), a uniquely potent degrader of BET proteins.







Abstract
Targeting cereblon (CRBN) is currently one of the most frequently reported proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) approaches, owing to favorable drug&#8208;like properties of CRBN ligands, immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs). However, IMiDs are known to be inherently unstable, readily undergoing hydrolysis in body fluids. Here we show that IMiDs and IMiD&#8208;based PROTACs rapidly hydrolyze in commonly utilized cell media, which significantly affects their cell efficacy. We designed novel CRBN binders, phenyl glutarimide (PG) analogues, and showed that they retained affinity for CRBN with high ligand efficiency (LE &gt;0.48) and displayed improved chemical stability. Our efforts led to the discovery of PG PROTAC 4&#8201;c (SJ995973), a uniquely potent degrader of bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal (BET) proteins that inhibited the viability of human acute myeloid leukemia MV4&#8208;11 cells at low picomolar concentrations (IC50=3&#8197;pM; BRD4 DC50=0.87&#8197;nM). These findings strongly support the utility of PG derivatives in the design of CRBN&#8208;directed PROTACs.

         <title>Direct 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylation of Alkenes towards 1,4&#8208;Diketones via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26822-26828, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct incorporation of two carbonyl groups into a double bond by diacylation is achieved for the first time via visible&#8208;light catalysis. Key to success is that N(n&#8208;Bu)4+ not only associates with the alkyl anion to avoid protonation, but also activates the &#945;&#8208;keto acid to undergo electrophilic addition. The metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;neutral and regioselective symmetric and unsymmetric 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes has the potential for many applications.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl compounds are intriguing motifs and versatile precursors in numerous pharmaceutical molecules and bioactive natural compounds. Direct incorporation of two carbonyl groups into a double bond at both ends is straightforward, but also challenging. Represented herein is the first example of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes by photocatalysis. Key to success is that N(n&#8208;Bu)4+ not only associates with the alkyl anion to avoid protonation, but also activates the &#945;&#8208;keto acid to undergo electrophilic addition. The &#945;&#8208;keto acid is employed both for acyl generation and electrophilic addition. By tuning the reductive and electrophilic ability of the acyl precursor, unsymmetric 1,4&#8208;dicarbonylation is achieved for the first time. This metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;neutral and regioselective 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes is executed by a photocatalyst for versatile substrates under extremely mild conditions and shows great potential in biomolecular and drug molecular derivatization.

         <title>Commercial Cu2Cr2O5 Decorated with Iron Carbide Nanoparticles as a Multifunctional Catalyst for Magnetically Induced Continuous&#8208;Flow Hydrogenation of Aromatic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26639-26646, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A commercial heterogeneous catalyst is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles to produce a multifunctional catalytic system with magnetic heating capabilities. Under magnetic induction, local hot spots are generated at the catalyst surface, unlocking continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation of aromatic ketones under mild conditions. This approach is versatile and potentially transferrable to a wide range of heterogeneous catalysts and transformations.







Abstract
Copper chromite is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles, producing a magnetically activatable multifunctional catalytic system. This system (ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5) can reduce aromatic ketones to aromatic alcohols when exposed to magnetic induction. Under magnetic excitation, the ICNPs generate locally confined hot spots, selectively activating the Cu2Cr2O5 surface while the global temperature remains low (&#8776;80&#8201;&#176;C). The catalyst selectively hydrogenates a scope of benzylic and non&#8208;benzylic ketones under mild conditions (3&#8197;bar H2, heptane), while ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5 or Cu2Cr2O5 are inactive when the same global temperature is adjusted by conventional heating. A flow reactor is presented that allows the use of magnetic induction for continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation at elevated pressure. The excellent catalytic properties of ICNPs@Cu2Cr2O5 for the hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfuralacetone are conserved for at least 17&#8197;h on stream, demonstrating for the first time the application of a magnetically heated catalyst to a continuously operated hydrogenation reaction in the liquid phase.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Layer Device for Light&#8208;Triggered Hydrogen Production from Alkaline Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26694-26701, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;layer device reforms alkaline alcohol to hydrogen with unprecedented activities under light illumination of a standard Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nitride. Such remarkable activity is attributed to the efficient light harvest and mitigated particle aggregation due to the multi&#8208;layer structure in the light&#8208;triggered alkaline alcohol reaction.







Abstract
It usually requires high temperature and high pressure to reform methanol with water to hydrogen with high turnover frequency (TOF). Here we show that hydrogen can be produced from alkaline methanol on a light&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;layer system with a very high hydrogen evolution rate up to ca. 1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;s&#8722;1 under the illumination of a standard Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nitride. The system can achieve a remarkable TOF up to 1.8&#215;106&#8197;moles of hydrogen per mole of Pt per hour under mild conditions. The total turnover number (TTN) of 470&#8201;000 measured over 38&#8197;hours is among the highest reported. The system does not lead to any COx emissions, hence it could feed clean hydrogen to fuel cells. In contrast to a slurry system, the proposed multi&#8208;layer system avoids particle aggregation and effectively uses light and Pt active sites.

     alt="A Multi-Layer Device for Light-Triggered Hydrogen Production from Alkaline Methanol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-layer device reforms alkaline alcohol to hydrogen with unprecedented activities under light illumination of a standard Pt-decorated carbon nitride. Such remarkable activity is attributed to the efficient light harvest and mitigated particle aggregation due to the multi-layer structure in the light-triggered alkaline alcohol reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually requires high temperature and high pressure to reform methanol with water to hydrogen with high turnover frequency (TOF). Here we show that hydrogen can be produced from alkaline methanol on a light-triggered multi-layer system with a very high hydrogen evolution rate up to ca. 1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under the illumination of a standard Pt-decorated carbon nitride. The system can achieve a remarkable TOF up to 1.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;moles of hydrogen per mole of Pt per hour under mild conditions. The total turnover number (TTN) of 470&#8201;000 measured over 38&#8197;hours is among the highest reported. The system does not lead to any CO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, hence it could feed clean hydrogen to fuel cells. In contrast to a slurry system, the proposed multi-layer system avoids particle aggregation and effectively uses light and Pt active sites. The performance is also attributed to the light-triggered reforming of alkaline methanol. This notable performance is a promising step toward practical light-driven hydrogen generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Donor/&#960;&#8208;Bridge Manipulation for Constructing a Stable NIR&#8208;II Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen with Balanced Phototheranostic Performance**

In the construction of a new NIR&#8208;II AIEgen with balanced fluorescence behavior and photothermal conversion efficiency, the engineering of the electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge was crucial. The AIEgen showed excellent performance in trimodal NIR&#8208;II FLI/PAI/PTI imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy in vitro and in vivo and shows great potential for in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Owing to their versatile functionality and tunable energy dissipation, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have emerged as a potential platform for multimodal theranostics. Nevertheless, the construction of AIE&#8208;active phototheranostic agents in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm), which allows superior resolution and minimized photodamage, is still a formidable challenge. Herein, benzo[c]thiophene serves as an electron&#8208;rich and bulky donor (D)/&#960;&#8208;bridge, which can enlarge the conjugation length and distort the backbone of an AIEgen. By precise D/&#960;&#8208;bridge engineering, highly stable NIR&#8208;II AIEgen DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ nanoparticles are obtained with acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence quantum yield and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. In addition, the spatial conformation of DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ is determined for the first time by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction and theoretical simulations. DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ NPs have good biocompatibility and show efficient photothermal therapeutic effects in in vitro tests. Furthermore, DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ NPs were used in fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal eradication of tumors in HepG2 and B16&#8208;F10 tumor&#8208;xenografted mice.

Chiral benzylic alkynes and 1,4&#8208;enynes can be obtained in a straightforward approach from commercially available terminal alkynes and a diverse range of compounds containing benzylic and allylic C&#8722;H bonds by using the title reaction. The success of this approach lies in newly designed anionic N,N,P(O)&#8208;ligands bearing a stable chiral oxazoline and a pentavalent phosphine oxide that are generated in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
The intermolecular asymmetric radical oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with readily available terminal alkynes is a promising method to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds because of the high atom and step economy, but remains underexplored. Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)benzylic and (cyclic)allylic C&#8722;H bonds with terminal alkynes that occurs with high to excellent enantioselectivity. Critical to the success is the rational design of chiral oxazoline&#8208;derived N,N,P(O)&#8208;ligands that not only tolerate the strong oxidative conditions which are requisite for intermolecular hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) processes but also induce the challenging enantiocontrol. Direct access to a range of synthetically useful chiral benzylic alkynes and 1,4&#8208;enynes, high site&#8208;selectivity among similar C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and facile synthesis of enantioenriched medicinally relevant compounds make this approach very attractive.

A novel nanomicelle based on triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion is proposed for luminescence ratiometric nanothermometry arising from temperature&#8208;dependent upconverted and downshifted luminescence emission intensities.







Abstract
Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a special non&#8208;linear photophysical process that converts low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons based on sensitizer/annihilator pairs. Here, we constructed a novel luminescence ratiometric nanothermometer based on TTA upconversion nanomicelles by encapsulating sensitizer/annihilator molecules into a temperature&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic triblock polymer and obtained good linear relationships between the luminescence ratio (integrated intensity ratio of upconverted luminescence peak to the downshifted phosphorescence peak) and the temperature. We also found chemical modification of annihilators would rule out the interference of the polymer concentration and stereochemical engineering of annihilators would readily regulate the thermal sensitivity.

A single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 active site structure was developed as an efficient sulfur host material to realize excellent electrochemical performance at high sulfur loading.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation system for advanced energy storage owing to a high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. However, the practical implementation of Li&#8208;S batteries has been thwarted by the detrimental shuttling behavior of polysulfides, and the sluggish kinetics in electrochemical processes. Herein, a novel single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 coordination structure (Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C) is precisely synthesized by an absorption&#8211;pyrolysis strategy and introduced as an effective sulfur host material. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal synergism between atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N5 active sites and the unique carbon support. The results exhibit that the sulfur composite cathode built on the Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C can not only adsorb polysulfides via chemical interaction, but also boost the redox reaction kinetics, thus mitigating the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the robust three&#8208;dimensional nitrogen doped carbon nanofiber with large surface area, and high porosity enables strong physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer process. Attributed to such unique features, Li&#8208;S batteries with S/Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C composite cathode realize outstanding cyclability and rate capability, as well as high areal capacities under raised sulfur loading, which demonstrates great potential in developing advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Phenoxy Radical&#8208;Induced Formation of Dual&#8208;Layered Protection Film for High&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>

A spontaneous redox reaction between the phenoxy radical Spiro&#8208;O8 and Li metal forms a highly conductive and uniform artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to protect the Li metal. Phenoxy radicals aid the decomposition of the lithium salt, leading to the formation of LiF inorganic film on the top. The dual&#8208;layered protective film gives stable dendrite&#8208;free cycling at high current density and area capacity.







Abstract
The uncontrollable dendrite growth of Li metal anode leads to poor cycle stability and safety concerns, hindering its utilization in high energy density batteries. Herein, a phenoxy radical Spiro&#8208;O8 is proposed as an artificial protection film for Li metal anode owing to its excellent film&#8208;forming capability and remarkable ionic conductivity. A spontaneous redox reaction between the Spiro&#8208;O8 and Li metal results in the formation of a uniform and highly ionic conductive organic film in the bottom. Meanwhile, the phenoxy radicals on surface of Spiro&#8208;O8 facilitate the decomposition of Li salt upon exposed to the ether electrolyte and lead the formation of LiF film on the top. Arising from the synergistic effects of inner high ionic conductive film and outer rigid film, stable Li plating/stripping can be realized at a high current density (4000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a high areal capacity of 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 550&#8197;h with an ultrahigh Li utilization rate of 54.6&#8201;%. As a proof of concept, this work shows a facile strategy to rationally fabricate dual&#8208;layered interfaces for Li metal anodes.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Simultaneous Imaging of Acidification and Proteolysis in Single Phagosomes Using Bifunctional Janus&#8208;Particle Probes</title>

A bifunctional Janus&#8208;particle probe consisting of a pH and proteolysis sensor enables the simultaneous imaging and quantification of acidification and proteolysis within single phagosomes in live cells.







Abstract
The digestion of pathogens inside phagosomes by immune cells occurs through a sequence of reactions including acidification and proteolysis, but how the reactions are orchestrated in the right order is unclear due to a lack of methods to simultaneously measure more than one reaction in phagosomes. Here we report a bifunctional Janus&#8208;particle probe to simultaneously monitor acidification and proteolysis in single phagosomes in live cells. Each probe consists of a pH reporter and a proteolysis reporter that are spatially separated but function concurrently. Using the Janus probes, we found the acidic pH needed to initiate and maintain proteolysis, revealing the mechanism for the sequential occurrence of both reactions during pathogen digestion. We showed how bacterium&#8208;derived lipopolysaccharides alter the acidification and proteolysis in phagosomes. This study showcases Janus&#8208;particle probes as a generally applicable tool for monitoring multiple reactions in intracellular vesicles.

         <title>In Situ Modulation of A&#8208;Site Vacancies in LaMnO3.15 Perovskite for Surface Lattice Oxygen Activation and Boosted Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26747-26754, December 13, 2021. </description>

The LaMnO3.15 with abundant La vacancy displayed improved redox performance such as toluene oxidation and ORR, which was promoted by the easier transferred electron from Mn to O and the activated surface lattice oxygen.







Abstract
Modulation of A&#8208;site defects is crucial to the redox reactions on ABO3 perovskites for both clean air application and electrochemical energy storage. Herein we report a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy for in situ regulation of La vacancies (VLa) in LaMnO3.15 by simply introducing urea in the traditional citrate process, and further reveal the fundamental relationship between VLa creation and surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) activation. The underlying mechanism is shortened Mn&#8722;O bonds, decreased orbital ordering, promoted MnO6 bending vibration and weakened Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, ultimately realizing enhanced Mn&#8208;3d and O&#8208;2p orbital hybridization. The LaMnO3.15 with optimized VLa exhibits order of magnitude increase in toluene oxidation and ca. 0.05&#8197;V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) increase of half&#8208;wave potential in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The reported strategy can benefit the development of novel defect&#8208;meditated perovskites in both heterocatalysis and electrocatalysis.

         <title>Rational Selection of Cyanines to Generate Conjugate Acid and Free Radicals for Photopolymerization upon Exposure at 860&#8201;nm</title>

Substitution of cyanines with different terminal indolium groups and distinct polymethine chain directs the excited state either to deactivation by internal conversion (IC) or photochemistry resulting in the generation of initiating radicals for free&#8208;radical polymerization and conjugate acid for cationic polymerization and self&#8208;polyaddition of vinyl ether&#8197;M1.







Abstract
Different cyanines absorbing in the NIR between 750 and 930&#8197;nm were applied to study the efficiency of both radical and cationic polymerization in combination with diaryliodonium salt. Variation of the connecting methine chain and structure of the terminal indolium moiety provided a deeper insight in the structure of the cyanine NIR&#8208;sensitizer and the efficiency to generate initiating radicals and conjugate acid. Photophysical studies were pursued by fluorescence spectroscopy providing a deeper understanding regarding the lifetime of the excited state and contribution of nonradiative deactivation resulting in generation of additional heat in the polymerization process. Furthermore, electrochemical experiments demonstrated connection to oxidation and reduction capability as influenced by the structural pattern of the sensitizer. LC&#8211;MS measurements provided a deeper pattern about the photoproducts formed. A nonamethine&#8208;based cyanine showed the best performance regarding bleaching in combination with an iodonium salt at 860&#8197;nm.

         <title>DNA Tiling Enables Precise Acylation&#8208;Based Labeling and Control of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26798-26805, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method that enables the site&#8208;localized acylation of mRNA at virtually any determined sites is described. The TRAIL method utilizes a novel DNA tiling strategy by hybridizing a pool of inexpensive &#8220;protector&#8221; DNAs to block mRNA and combining with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA to extrude a reactive RNA loop for acylation. This approach can be employed for both mRNA labeling and control for multiple applications.







Abstract
Methods for the site&#8208;selective labeling of long, native RNAs are needed for studying mRNA biology and future therapies. Current approaches involve engineering RNA sequences, which may alter folding, or are limited to specific sequences or bases. Here, we describe a versatile strategy for mRNA conjugation via a novel DNA&#8208;tiling approach. The method, TRAIL, exploits a pool of &#8220;protector&#8221; oligodeoxynucleotides to hybridize and block the mRNA, combined with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA that extrudes a reactive RNA loop for acylation at a predetermined site. Using TRAIL, an azido&#8208;acylimidazole reagent was employed for labeling and controlling RNA for multiple applications in&#8197;vitro and in cells, including analysis of RNA&#8208;binding proteins, imaging mRNA in cells, and analysis and control of translation. The TRAIL approach offers an efficient and accessible way to label and manipulate RNAs of virtually any length or origin without altering native sequence.

The method, TRAIL, exploits a pool of &#8220;protector&#8221; oligodeoxynucleotides to hybridize and block the mRNA, combined with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA that extrudes a reactive RNA loop for acylation at a predetermined site. Using TRAIL, an azido-acylimidazole reagent was employed for labeling and controlling RNA for multiple applications in&#8197;vitro and in cells, including analysis of RNA-binding proteins, imaging mRNA in cells, and analysis and control of translation. The TRAIL approach offers an efficient and accessible way to label and manipulate RNAs of virtually any length or origin without altering native sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dolabriferol&#8197;C by a Highly Stereoselective One&#8208;Pot Coupling of a meso&#8208;3,7&#8208;Diketone with Two Chiral Aldehydes</title>

The total synthesis of dolabriferol&#8197;C was achieved by retro&#8208;Claisen fragmentation of its putative contiguous precursor, thus establishing the former as a plausible isolation artifact. The carbon skeleton of the precursor was assembled using a novel strategy involving a highly stereoselective three&#8208;component bisaldol coupling that sets the absolute configuration of seven (or eight) stereocenters in a one&#8208;pot process.







Abstract
Total synthesis of the noncontiguous polypropionate dolabriferol&#8197;C was achieved by retro&#8208;Claisen fragmentation of its putative contiguous precursor under mild conditions, thus establishing the former as a plausible isolation artifact. The precursor was prepared by a novel one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component bisaldol coupling of a meso (Z,Z)&#8208;bisenolate (generated in situ from a 3,7&#8208;diketone) with two enantioenriched aldehydes to set the absolute configuration of seven stereocenters in one step. The first aldol reaction proceeded with enantioselective desymmetrization of the bisenolate to produce an enantiomerically pure enolate&#8211;aldolate. Quenching at this stage enabled a streamlined synthesis of dolabriferol. Addition of a racemic aldehyde to the enolate&#8211;aldolate resulted in aldol coupling with kinetic resolution of the &#8220;matched&#8221; aldehyde; overall, a sequential enantiotopic&#8208;group&#8208;selective (SEGS) bisaldol reaction. Because the desired adduct results from the &#8220;mismatched&#8221; aldol reaction, use of enantioenriched aldehyde was required.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Featured Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Trafficking of Protein Delivery and Neuroprotection</title>

The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;featured M2L4&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) via host&#8211;guest chemistry generates fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) that can deliver protein into neural cells, a cell line that is hard to transfect by the conventional strategy.







Abstract
The delivery of protein into mammalian cells enables the dissection and manipulation of biological processes; however, this potency is challenged by the lack of an efficient protein delivery tool and a means to monitor its intracellular trafficking. Herein, we report that the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;featured metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine can generate fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) to deliver protein into neural cells, a cell line that is hard to transfect using conventional strategy. Further, the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of TPE enabled the fluorescent monitoring of cytosolic protein release. It is found that FSNPs can deliver and release protein into cytosol for subcellular targeting as fast as 18&#8197;h post&#8208;delivery. Moreover, the delivery of molecular chaperone DJ&#8208;1 using FSNPs activates MAPK/ERK signaling of neural cells to protect cells from oxidative stress.

Palladium nanoparticles (PdNp) were revealed as an efficient hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) catalyst for the deuterium and tritium labeling of benzylic positions of complex molecules. Several model compounds and popular bioactive molecules were submitted to HIE reactions catalyzed by the PdNp.







Abstract
Palladium nanoparticles (PdNp) were revealed as an efficient hydrogen isotope exchange catalyst for the deuterium and tritium labeling of benzylic positions of complex molecules. A practical way to obtain small palladium nanoparticles and to apply them as a catalyst for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is presented. Several model compounds and popular bioactive molecules were submitted to HIE reactions catalyzed by the PdNp. Benzylic positions situated far away from heteroatoms were labeled with high isotopic enrichments. The observed non&#8208;directed HIE gave rise to regioselectivities complementary to those obtained with other methods, which typically require specific directing groups. For this reason, the successful deuteration of a broad variety of benzylic positions created a helpful tool to produce internal LC&#8208;MS standards of complex drugs. Furthermore, this nanocatalyst paved the way for the radiolabeling of drug molecules with high specific activities by using low pressures of tritium gas.

Multiple noncovalent interactions involving cyclopentenyl cations in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite were identified by using two&#8208;dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. It was found that the hydrocarbon pool reaction is modulated by carbocation&#8208;induced noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Carbocations such as cyclic carbenium ions are important intermediates in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction. The MTO reaction propagates through a complex hydrocarbon pool process. Understanding the carbocation&#8208;involved hydrocarbon pool reaction on a molecular level still remains challenging. Here we show that electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentenyl cations stabilized in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite are able to capture the alkanes, methanol, and olefins produced during MTO reaction via noncovalent interactions. Intermolecular spatial proximities/interactions are identified by using two&#8208;dimensional 13C&#8211;13C correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Combined NMR experiments and theoretical analysis suggests that in addition to the dispersion and CH/&#960; interactions, the multiple functional groups in the cyclopentenyl cations produce strong attractive force via cation&#8208;induced dipole, cation&#8211;dipole and cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. These carbocation&#8208;induced noncovalent interactions modulate the product selectivity of hydrocarbon pool reaction.

         <title>Solvation Effect on the Improved Sodium Storage Performance of N&#8208;Heteropentacenequinone for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26806-26812, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is studied as electrode material to investigate the solvation effect in different sodium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. By revealing the failure mechanism of TAPQ in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, we discuss how the solvation effect influences interfacial electrochemical characteristics and attributed the electrolyte compatibility to the stabilization effect of reaction intermediate via solvation effect.







Abstract
The performance of electrode material is correlated with the choice of electrolyte, however, how the solvation has significant impact on electrochemical behavior is underdeveloped. Herein, N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is investigated to reveal the solvation effect on the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries in different electrolyte environment.

     alt="Solvation Effect on the Improved Sodium Storage Performance of N-Heteropentacenequinone for Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is studied as electrode material to investigate the solvation effect in different sodium-ion battery electrolytes. By revealing the failure mechanism of TAPQ in carbonate-based electrolytes, we discuss how the solvation effect influences interfacial electrochemical characteristics and attributed the electrolyte compatibility to the stabilization effect of reaction intermediate via solvation effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of electrode material is correlated with the choice of electrolyte, however, how the solvation has significant impact on electrochemical behavior is underdeveloped. Herein, N-heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is investigated to reveal the solvation effect on the performance of sodium-ion batteries in different electrolyte environment. TAPQ cycled in diglyme-based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate-based electrolyte. The function of solvation effect is mainly embodied in two aspects: one is the stabilization of anion intermediate via the compatibility of electrode and electrolyte, the other is the interfacial electrochemical characteristics influenced by solvation sheath structure.

         <title>Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte Chemistry Towards High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>

By rational design of the solvation configuration, a cation&#8211;solvent fully coordinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte with strong oxidation resistance up to 4.5&#8197;V (versus Na+/Na) was developed and applied in graphite//NVPF and LHC//NVPF full cells which showed superior rate performance and unprecedented cycling stability.







Abstract
Although ether&#8208;based electrolytes have been extensively applied in anode evaluation of batteries, anodic instability arising from solvent oxidability is always a tremendous obstacle to matching with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Herein, by rational design for solvation configuration, the fully coordinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte with strong resistance against oxidation is reported, which remains anodically stable with high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPF) cathode under 4.5&#8197;V (versus Na+/Na) protected by an effective interphase. The assembled graphite//NVPF full cells display superior rate performance and unprecedented cycling stability. Beyond that, the constructed full cells coupling the high&#8208;voltage NVPF cathode with hard carbon anode exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances in terms of high average output voltage up to 3.72&#8197;V, long&#8208;term cycle life (such as 95&#8201;% capacity retention after 700 cycles) and high energy density (247&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). In short, the optimized ether&#8208;based electrolyte enriches systematic options, the ability to maintain oxidative stability and compatibility with various anodes, exhibiting attractive prospects for application.

         <title>Critical Assessment of the Reducing Ability of Breslow&#8208;type Derivatives and Implications for Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reactions**

A major cleanup for starting anew: Bio&#8208;inspired Breslow&#8208;type enolates, which mimic thiamine derivatives, are far better reducing agents than previously considered. The reevaluation of the redox ability of these key intermediates refutes established misconceptions and sheds a new light on radical processes involving N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of acyl azolium salts stemming from thiazolylidenes CNS, triazolylidenes CTN, mesoionic carbenes CMIC and the generation of their corresponding radicals and enolates, covering about 60 Breslow&#8208;type derivatives. This study highlights the role of additives in the redox behavior of these compounds and unveils several critical misconceptions about radical transformations of aldehyde derivatives under N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. In particular, the reducing ability of enolates has been dramatically underestimated in the case of biomimetic CNS. In contrast with previous electrochemical studies, we show that these catalytic intermediates can transfer electrons to iodobenzene within minutes at room temperature. Enols derived from CMIC are not the previously claimed super electron donors, although enolate derivatives of CNS and CMIC are powerful reducing agents.

         <title>Nitrene Photochemistry of Manganese N&#8208;Haloamides**

Here we report the synthesis and nitrene transfer photochemistry of MnIII N&#8208;haloamide complexes. Photolysis results in both C&#8722;H bond amination and olefinic aziridination products. Low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy indicates halogen&#8208;dependent photoreactivity: Photolysis of N&#8208;chloroamides cleaves the Mn&#8722;N bond to generate MnII and amidyl radical species; in contrast, photolysis of N&#8208;iodoamides proceeds via N&#8722;I cleavage yielding a formally MnIV nitrenoid.







Abstract
Manganese complexes supported by macrocyclic tetrapyrrole ligands represent an important platform for nitrene transfer catalysis and have been applied to both C&#8722;H amination and olefin aziridination catalysis. The reactivity of the transient high&#8208;valent Mn nitrenoids that mediate these processes renders characterization of these species challenging. Here we report the synthesis and nitrene transfer photochemistry of a family of MnIII N&#8208;haloamide complexes. The S=2 N&#8208;haloamide complexes are characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis, IR, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopies, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photolysis of these complexes results in the formal transfer of a nitrene equivalent to both C&#8722;H bonds, such as the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of tetrahydrofuran, and olefinic substrates, such as styrene, to afford aminated and aziridinated products, respectively. Low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy and analysis of kinetic isotope effects for C&#8722;H amination indicate halogen&#8208;dependent photoreactivity: Photolysis of N&#8208;chloroamides proceeds via initial cleavage of the Mn&#8722;N bond to generate MnII and amidyl radical intermediates; in contrast, photolysis of N&#8208;iodoamides proceeds via N&#8722;I cleavage to generate a MnIV nitrenoid (i.e., {MnNR}7 species). These results establish N&#8208;haloamide ligands as viable precursors in the photosynthesis of metal nitrenes and highlight the power of ligand design to provide access to reactive intermediates in group&#8208;transfer catalysis.

&#960;&#8208;Allylpalladium&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;carbodipoles were generated from the carbonate derivatives of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones and isomerized in situ to electronically neutral &#951;2&#8208;Pd0&#8208;cyclopentadienone complexes. These HOMO&#8208;raised cyclopentadienones participate, via &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation, in inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;type cycloadditions and cascade Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman&#8208; or Rauhut&#8211;Currier&#8208;type addition/allylic substitution reactions with diverse electrophiles.







Abstract
We disclose that the carbonates of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones can form &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;carbodipoles, which isomerize to interesting &#951;2&#8208;Pd0&#8208;cyclopentadienone complexes. Compared with the labile parent cyclopentadienone, the HOMO energy of the related &#951;2&#8208;complex was significantly raised via the back&#8208;bonding of Pd0 as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis base, rendering the uncoordinated C=C bond an electron&#8208;richer dienophile in inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;type reactions with diverse 1&#8208;azadienes. The vinylogous (aza)Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman or cross Rauhut&#8211;Currier addition to (imine)carbonyls or activated alkenes, respectively, was also realized to afford chiral [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadducts, respectively, after trapping the re&#8208;generated &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species. New C1&#8208;symmetric ligands from simple chiral sources were developed, exhibiting high stereoselectivity even with racemic substrates via an unusual dynamic kinetic resolution process.

     alt="&#960;-Lewis-Base-Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Umpolung Reactions of Cyclopentadienones and Tropone"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#960;-Allylpalladium-based 1,2-carbodipoles were generated from the carbonate derivatives of 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenones and isomerized in situ to electronically neutral &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-cyclopentadienone complexes. These HOMO-raised cyclopentadienones participate, via &#960;-Lewis base activation, in inverse-electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder-type cycloadditions and cascade Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman- or Rauhut&#8211;Currier-type addition/allylic substitution reactions with diverse electrophiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disclose that the carbonates of 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenones can form &#960;-allylpalladium-based 1,2-carbodipoles, which isomerize to interesting &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-cyclopentadienone complexes. Compared with the labile parent cyclopentadienone, the HOMO energy of the related &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-complex was significantly raised via the back-bonding of Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as a &#960;-Lewis base, rendering the uncoordinated C=C bond an electron-richer dienophile in inverse-electron-demand aza-Diels&#8211;Alder-type reactions with diverse 1-azadienes. The vinylogous (aza)Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman or cross Rauhut&#8211;Currier addition to (imine)carbonyls or activated alkenes, respectively, was also realized to afford chiral [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadducts, respectively, after trapping the re-generated &#960;-allylpalladium species. New C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric ligands from simple chiral sources were developed, exhibiting high stereoselectivity even with racemic substrates via an unusual dynamic kinetic resolution process. Besides, tropone could be similarly activated by a Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cyclic carbocations are important intermediates in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction over zeolite. In their Research Article on page&#8197;26847, Jun Xu and co&#8208;workers report that the carbocations formed in the MTO reaction can capture small hydrocarbon molecules via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions have been identified by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and confirmed to be the key factors in modulating reaction properties.

Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent hemicyanines, known for their structural diversity, high fluorescence quantum yields, and good biocompatibility, are attractive scaffolds for the construction of activatable optical probes for disease diagnosis. This Review discusses the design strategies and sensing mechanisms of these probes, with an emphasis on their applications in early disease detection and imaging&#8208;guided therapies.







Abstract
Molecular activatable probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence play a critical role in in vivo imaging of biomarkers for drug screening and disease diagnosis. With structural diversity and high fluorescence quantum yields, hemicyanine dyes have emerged as a versatile scaffold for the construction of activatable optical probes. This Review presents a survey of hemicyanine&#8208;based NIR activatable probes (HNAPs) for in vivo imaging and early diagnosis of diseases. The molecular design principles of HNAPs towards activatable optical signaling against various biomarkers are discussed with a focus on their broad applications in the detection of diseases including inflammation, acute organ failure, skin diseases, intestinal diseases, and cancer. This progress not only proves the unique value of HNAPs in preclinical research but also highlights their high translational potential in clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Interfaces and Interfacial Layers in Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

This Minireview summarizes the recent developments on interfaces in inorganic perovskite solar cells, with special focus on the fundamental understanding of how interfaces influence the performance of devices. Directions for developing highly efficient and stable inorganic perovskite solar cells by interface engineering are also provided.







Abstract
Owing to their superior thermal stability, metal halide inorganic perovskite materials continue to attract interest for photovoltaics applications. The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) for solar cells based on inorganic perovskites is over 20&#8201;%. As this PCE corresponds to 73&#8201;% of the theoretical limit, there remains more room for further improving the device PCEs than for improving organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The main loss is in the photovoltage, which is limited by interfaces in terms of non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by traps and energy&#8208;level mismatch. Furthermore, inefficient charge extraction at interfacial contacts reduces the photocurrent and fill factor. This Minireview summarizes the recent developments in the fundamental understanding of how the interfaces and interfacial layers influence the performance of solar cells based on inorganic perovskite absorbers. An outlook for the development of highly efficient and stable inorganic PSCs from the interface point of view is also given.

         <title>Conformational Control of a Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cage via the Dissymmetrical Modulation of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26523-26527, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, self&#8208;assembly of dissymmetrical ligands can generate a series of isomers with similar thermodynamic stability. In this work, the conformation in the self&#8208;assembly process can be precisely controlled via the increase in ligand dissymmetry. Finally, only the cis&#8208;isomer was obtained. This strategy offered an avenue for designing metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures based on dissymmetrical organic ligands.







Abstract
In nature as well as life systems, the presence of asymmetrical and dissymmetrical structures with specific functions is extremely common. However, the construction of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies based on dissymmetrical ligands still remains a considerable challenge for avoiding the generation of unexpected isomers with similar thermodynamic stabilities, especially for three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structures. In this study, a strategy for the conformational control of metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages via the enhancement of ligand dissymmetry was proposed. Four dissymmetrical ditopic ligands were designed and synthesized. By increasing the dissymmetry of length or angle, conformations of assemblies were precisely controlled to form discrete cis&#8208;PdnL2n molecular cages.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent CO2 Electroreduction over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>

Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts show different temperature&#8208;dependent CO2RR performance due to their different adsorption behaviour of key reaction intermediates.







Abstract
Reaction temperature is an important parameter to tune the selectivity and activity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to different thermodynamics of CO2RR and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, temperature&#8208;dependent CO2RR over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are investigated from 303 to 343&#8197;K. Increasing the reaction temperature improves and decreases CO Faradaic efficiency over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts at high overpotentials, respectively. CO current density over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst increases with temperature, then gets into a plateau at 323&#8197;K, finally reaches the maximum value of 185.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 343&#8197;K. While CO current density over Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst achieves the maximum value of 252.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 323&#8197;K, and then drops significantly to 202.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 343&#8197;K. Temperature programmed desorption results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the difference of temperature&#8208;dependent variation on CO Faradaic efficiency and current density between Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts results from the varied adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates during CO2RR.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acidic PtIr Multipods Enable High&#8208;Performance Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>

PtIr multipods with low Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;O2 batteries. The low Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms on the PtIr surface entails a down&#8208;shifting of the d&#8208;band center, which brings low oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction and oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction overpotentials.







Abstract
The sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics concomitant with the high overpotentials and parasitic reactions from cathodes and solvents is the major challenge in aprotic lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. Herein, PtIr multipods with a low Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for improving overpotentials and stabilities. DFT calculations disclose that electrons have a strong disposition to transfer from Ir to Pt, since Pt has a higher electronegativity than Ir, resulting in a lower Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms than that on the pure Pt surface. The low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms on the PtIr surface entails a high electron density and a down&#8208;shifting of the d&#8208;band center, thereby weakening the binding energy towards intermediates (LiO2), which is the key in achieving low oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction (ORR) and oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction (OER) overpotentials. The Li&#8211;O2 cell based on PtIr electrodes exhibits a very low overall discharge/charge overpotential (0.44&#8197;V) and an excellent cycle life (180 cycles), outperforming the bulk of reported noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hindrance of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode via Surface Gradient Penetration of Tantalum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26535-26539, December 13, 2021. </description>

The Ta doping created some low&#8208;valence Ni, decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between transition metal and Li+, thus the Li+ diffusion energy barrier has been decreased and the kinetic hindrance was mitigated.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, they still suffer from poor rate capability and low specific capacity due to the severe kinetic hindrance at the nondilute state during Li+ intercalation. Herein, combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that this obstacle can be tackled by regulating the oxidation state of nickel via injecting high&#8208;valence foreign Ta5+. The as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 delivers a high specific capacity (211.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C), high initial Coulombic efficiency (93.8&#8201;%), excellent rate capability (157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8201;C), and good durability (90.4&#8201;% after 100 cycles under 0.5&#8201;C). This work provides a strategy to mitigate the Li+ kinetic hindrance of the appealing single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and will inspire peers to conduct an intensive study.

         <title>A Five&#8208;Coordinate Compound with Inverted Ligand Field: An Unprecedented Geometry for Silver(III)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26545-26549, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) complex [trans&#8208;(CF3)2AgBr2]&#8722; (16 electron) undergoes a marked stereochemical change upon coordination of an additional Br&#8722; ligand. The resulting five&#8208;coordinate [(CF3)2AgBr3]2&#8722; complex (18 electron) exhibits trigonal bipyramidal geometry, which is unprecedented for AgIII. This five&#8208;coordinate compound also exhibits inverted ligand field.







Abstract
By using suitable synthetic procedures, we have first isolated the square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) compounds [PPh4][trans&#8208;(CF3)2AgX2] [X=Cl (1&#8201;a), Br (2&#8201;a)]. The geometry and stereochemistry of the chloro&#8208;derivative 1&#8201;a have been unambiguously established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) methods. Following our calculations on the relative stability of the cis&#8208;/trans&#8208;[(CF3)2AgX2]&#8722; couples (X=F, Cl, Br, I), the experimentally obtained compounds 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a appear to be kinetically favored stereoisomers. They display some tendency to associate an additional X&#8722; ligand affording rare five&#8208;coordinate AgIII species [(CF3)2AgX3]2&#8722;. Interestingly, compound [PPh4]2[(CF3)2AgBr3] (3) has been identified by SC&#8208;XRD methods as the first AgIII derivative with trigonal symmetry in general and trigonal bipyramidal geometry in particular. This unusual five&#8208;coordinate species also exhibits inverted ligand field.

         <title>Multivariate Synergistic Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Superproton Conductivity for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</title>

Multivariate flexible MOF facilitates efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding formation by synergistic self&#8208;adapting its flexible structure, maintaining excellent proton conductivity. Based on compelling proton conductivity, a single&#8208;cell of MOF&#8208;based PEMs with long&#8208;term durability is assembled and exhibits excellent power density, which is promising for the practical application of proton&#8208;conducting MOFs in DMFCs.







Abstract
Improving proton conductivity and fabricating viable metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are central issues exploiting electrolyte MOFs. We aim to design multivariate flexibility synergistic strategy to achieve Flexible MOFs (FMOFs) with high conductivity at a wide range of humidity. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and temperature&#8208;dependent Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT&#8208;IR) prove the synergistic self&#8208;adaption between dynamic torsion of alkyl sulfonic acid and dynamic breathing of FMOF, forming a continuous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks to maintain high conductivity. Based on the convincing proton conductivity, we construct a series of long&#8208;term durable MOF&#8208;based PEMs that serve as a bridge between MOF and fuel cell. Consequently, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of the flexible PMNS1&#8208;40 exhibits a maximum single&#8208;cell power density of 34.76&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and hopefully opens doors to evaluate the practical application of proton&#8208;conducting MOFs in direct methanol fuel cells.

Preparation of diverse glycans is essential to glycobiology, while synthetically useful enzymes for this purpose are limited. This study discovered a general tolerance of galactosyltransferases (GalTs) toward uncommon donor UDP&#8208;galactosamine. A two&#8208;step strategy was devised to harness this property for the facile synthesis of GalNAc&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
Accessing large numbers of structurally diverse glycans and derivatives is essential to functional glycomics. We showed a general tolerance of galactosyltransferases toward uridine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;galactosamine (UDP&#8208;GalN), which is not a commonly used sugar nucleotide donor. The property was harnessed to develop a two&#8208;step chemoenzymatic strategy for facile synthesis of novel and divergent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)&#8208;glycosides and derivatives in preparative scales. The discovery and the application of the new property of existing glycosyltransferases expand their catalytic capabilities in generating novel carbohydrate linkages, thus prompting the synthesis of diverse glycans and glycoconjugates for biological studies.

         <title>Stabilizing MXene by Hydration Chemistry in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26587-26591, December 13, 2021. </description>

Hydration chemistry of inorganic salts is utilized to decrease the attack of MXene by free water and oxygen molecules in aqueous solution. This approach can prolong the MXene shelf life to up to 400&#8197;days with negligible loss of surface chemistry and bulk carrier properties.







Abstract
MXenes attract interest in diverse fields but suffer from fast structural degradation by attacking of dissolved oxygen and water molecules in aqueous solution. This drawback hinders the long&#8208;term storage, applications and understanding of the chemical nature of MXenes. Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally sustainable way for long&#8208;term storage of MXenes in aqueous solution by hydration chemistry of nontoxic inorganic salts. The attacking of MXene by free water and dissolved oxygen molecules is inhibited by decreasing the water activity, which simultaneously lowers the dissolved oxygen concentration, of saline solution. As a result, the storage life of MXene can be prolonged to up to 400&#8197;days at ambient conditions without loss of intrinsic surface chemistry and bulk carrier properties. Over 90&#8201;% of salt protectant can be recycled by simply evaporating the final waste liquor after fully extracting the MXene to minimize the waste discharge and processing cost. This work offers a commercializable approach with high cost&#8208;effectiveness, processing sustainability and environmental benefit for extending the shelf life of MXenes.

         <title>La3Ga3Ge2S3O10: An Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxysulfide Designed by Anion&#8208;Directed Band Gap Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26561-26565, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen anions possess high polarizability leading to strong SHG response, but their high energy levels prevent us from pushing the optical windows into UV regions. The anion&#8208;directed band gap engineering associated with O/S anion order yields the novel UV nonlinear optical oxysulfide La3Ga3Ge2S3O10 with an exceptionally large band gap of 4.70&#8197;eV. The oxysulfide exhibits phase matching behaviors with SHG intensity twice that of KH2PO4.







Abstract
Chalcogenide&#8208;containing compounds have been widely studied as infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, they have never been applied in the ultraviolet (UV) region owing to the high energy levels of chalcogen anions, leading to band gap narrowing. We report the synthesis of a new UV NLO oxysulfide La3Ga3Ge2S3O10 with an exceptionally wide band gap of 4.70&#8197;eV due to from the unique anion&#8208;ordered frameworks comprising 1D 1&#8734;[(Ga3/5Ge2/5)3S3O3] triangular tubes and 0D (Ga3/5Ge2/5)2O7 dimers of corner&#8208;sharing (Ga/Ge)S2O2 and (Ga/Ge)O4 tetrahedra, respectively. Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements revealed that La3Ga3Ge2S3O10 was phase matchable with twice the SHG response of KH2PO4. The results of theoretical calculations suggest that the strong SHG response is mainly attributable to the S&#8208;3p and O&#8208;2p orbitals in the occupied states. The anion&#8208;directed band&#8208;gap engineering may give insights into the application of NLO oxychalcogenides in the UV regions.

A highly enantioselective halogenation/semipinacol rearrangement was realized through a ligand&#8208;controlled stereodivergent kinetic resolution. An array of optically active quinolone derivates and quinoline alkaloids were provided simultaneously by using a chiral Sc(OTf)3/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex as catalyst.

Abstract
A highly enantioselective halogenation/semipinacol rearrangement of isatin&#8208;derived allylic alcohols has been developed with a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex as catalyst. This strategy involved a pivotal stereodivergent kinetic resolution process and provided a facile and efficient entry to optically active halo&#8208;substituted quinolone derivatives and quinoline alkaloids with a quaternary stereocenter simultaneously under mild reaction conditions. Based on the control experiments together with kinetic studies and DFT calculations, a possible catalytic cycle was proposed to illustrate the reaction process and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Acceptorless Dehydrogenation of Methanol to Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen using Molecular Catalysts</title>

Homogeneous catalysts based on ruthenium and manganese enable the generation of gaseous CO and H2 (syngas) from conveniently storable and easily transportable methanol. Conversion/time profiles and kinetic isotope effects together with spectroscopically detected intermediates indicate rapid dehydrogenation followed by two possible catalytic pathways via formaldehyde or methyl formate for decarbonylation as mechanistic manifold.







Abstract
The acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen was investigated using homogeneous molecular complexes. Complexes of ruthenium and manganese comprising the MACHO ligand framework showed promising activities for this reaction. The molecular ruthenium complex [RuH(CO)(BH4)(HN(C2H4PPh2)2)] (Ru&#8208;MACHO&#8208;BH) achieved up to 3150 turnovers for carbon monoxide and 9230 turnovers for hydrogen formation at 150&#8201;&#176;C reaching pressures up to 12&#8197;bar when the decomposition was carried out in a closed vessel. Control experiments affirmed that the metal complex mediates the initial fast dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate followed by subsequent slow decarbonylation. Depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions, the CO/H2 ratio in the gas mixture thus varies over a broad range from almost pure hydrogen to the stoichiometric limit of 1:2.

&lt;p&gt;The acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen was investigated using homogeneous molecular complexes. Complexes of ruthenium and manganese comprising the MACHO ligand framework showed promising activities for this reaction. The molecular ruthenium complex [RuH(CO)(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(HN(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (Ru-MACHO-BH) achieved up to 3150 turnovers for carbon monoxide and 9230 turnovers for hydrogen formation at 150&#8201;&#176;C reaching pressures up to 12&#8197;bar when the decomposition was carried out in a closed vessel. Control experiments affirmed that the metal complex mediates the initial fast dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate followed by subsequent slow decarbonylation. Depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions, the CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio in the gas mixture thus varies over a broad range from almost pure hydrogen to the stoichiometric limit of 1:2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific 5&#8208;Formyl Cytosine Mediated DNA&#8208;Histone Cross&#8208;Links: Synthesis and Polymerase Bypass by Human DNA Polymerase &#951;</title>

DNA&#8211;histone cross&#8208;links (DPCs) have been synthesized efficiently via oxime ligation. These DPC lesions block DNA replication but the replication block can be removed via proteolytic processing.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;protein cross&#8208;links (DPCs) between DNA epigenetic mark 5&#8208;formylC and lysine residues of histone proteins spontaneously form in human cells. Such conjugates are likely to influence chromatin structure and mediate DNA replication, transcription, and repair, but are challenging to study due to their reversible nature. Here we report the construction of site specific, hydrolytically stable DPCs between 5fdC in DNA and K4 of histone H3 and an investigation of their effects on DNA replication. Our approach employs oxime ligation, allowing for site&#8208;specific conjugation of histones to DNA under physiological conditions. Primer extension experiments revealed that histone H3&#8208;DNA crosslinks blocked DNA synthesis by hPol &#951; polymerase, but were bypassed following proteolytic processing.

         <title>Controlled Asymmetric Charge Distribution of Active Centers in Conjugated Polymers for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26483-26488, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free conjugated polymer (CP) catalysts were developed with different degrees of asymmetry. The polymer catalyst with both asymmetric backbone and sidechain configuration provides larger dipole moment, regulated charge distribution, and higher ORR catalytic activity.







Abstract
Active center reconstruction is essential for high performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Usually, the ORR activity stems from the electronic environment of active sites by charge redistribution. We introduce an asymmetry strategy to adjust the charge distribution of active centers by designing conjugated polymer (CP) catalysts with different degrees of asymmetry. We synthesized asymmetric backbone CP (asy&#8208;PB) by modifying B&#8592;N coordination bonds and asymmetric sidechain CP (asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A) with different alkyl chain lengths. Both CPs with backbone and sidechain asymmetry exhibit superior ORR performance to their symmetric counterparts (sy&#8208;P and sy&#8208;PB). The asy&#8208;PB with greater asymmetry shows higher catalytic activity than asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A with relatively smaller asymmetry. DFT calculations reveal that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by asymmetric structure endows the center carbon atom of bipyridine with efficient catalytic activity.

         <title>High Density Polyethylenes Bearing Isolated In&#8208;Chain Carbonyls**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a low CO content in the main&#8208;chain of polyethylene along with remarkable isolated carbonyl selectivity was achieved via palladium catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with metal carbonyls. This polyethylene copolymer retained the main physical properties of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), while treating the obtained copolymer with UV light resulted in partial degradation. Therefore, the synthesized materials may serve as more environmentally friendly alternative plastics than traditional polyethylene materials.







Abstract
Polyethylene materials are highly important polymers which are produced in the largest volume among all plastics. Due to the chemical inert property of saturated carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, the degradation of polyethylene is extremely challenging, which prevents them from efficient chemical recycling. Installing functional groups in the main chain of polyethylenes may facilitate the degradation and following chemical recycling of polyethylene materials. Here we report a highly selective approach for the synthesis of high density polyethylenes bearing low content isolated in&#8208;chain carbonyls. Linear high&#8208;molecular weight polyethylene chains are synthesized via the palladium catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with metal carbonyls. Different from traditional ethylene/CO copolymerization reactions, excellent non&#8208;alternating selectivity has been achieved. While the properties of polyethylene have been retained in the copolymer, faster degradation compared with that of polyethylene was observed upon UV light irradiation. The synthesized materials may therefore serve as more environmentally friendly alternative plastics than traditional polyethylene materials.

Carbene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of phosphorus atoms to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates affords chiral phosphines with potential applications as ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
Disclosed herein is the first carbene&#8208;organocatalyzed asymmetric addition of phosphine nucleophiles to the in situ generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates. Our reaction enantioselectively constructs carbon&#8211;phosphine bonds and prepares chiral phosphines with high optical purities. The phosphine products are suitable for transforming to chiral ligands or catalysts with applications in asymmetric catalysis. The diarylalkyl or trialkyl phosphine products from our catalytic reactions, air&#8208;sensitive and reactive in nature, can be trapped (and stored) in their sulfur&#8208;oxidized form for operational simplicities.

Catalytic asymmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 2&#8208;pyrones with electronically unbiased indenes have been realized. This method enables the rapid and enantioselective construction of a wide range of hexahydrofluorenyl bridged&#8208;lactone scaffolds. Based on this method, asymmetric total syntheses of cephanolides&#8197;A and B have been accomplished.







Abstract
An inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction could complement the conventional normal&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered carbocycles. However, catalytic asymmetric all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based IEDDA reactions are underdeveloped. Herein, we disclosed a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric IEDDA reaction using electron&#8208;deficient 3&#8208;carboalkoxyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrones and electronically unbiased indenes as reactants. This method enables the rapid and enantioselective construction of a wide range of hexahydrofluorenyl bridged&#8208;lactone scaffolds. Using this method, asymmetric total syntheses of cephanolides&#8197;A and B were accomplished.

Using this method, asymmetric total syntheses of cephanolides&#8197;A and B were accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin: A Promising Precursor of Directly Fused Porphyrin(2.1.1.1) Dimer and meso&#8208;&#945; Fused N&#8208;Confused Porphyrin Dimer</title>

Metalation of tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin afforded novel fused porphyrin dimers such as porphyrin(2.1.1.1) dimer bis&#8208;ZnII complex and N&#8208;confused porphyrin dimer bis&#8208;NiII complex through metalation&#8208;induced transannular C&#8722;C bond formation. Both of these complexes showed macrocyclic 36&#960; conjugation, exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively.







Abstract
3,7,23,27&#8208;Tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin 2 was synthesized as a novel octaphyrin bearing two meso&#8208;free positions. Surprisingly, its ZnII and NiII complexation reactions produced a directly fused porphyrin(2.1.1.1) dimer 6, and a meso&#8208;&#945; fused N&#8208;confused porphyrin (NCP) dimer 7, as the first example of NCP tape, respectively, via transannular C&#8722;C bond formation. While 6 exhibits a diatropic ring&#8208;current effect owing to the global 36&#960; M&#246;bius aromaticity, 7 shows a paratropic ring&#8208;current effect due to the global H&#252;ckel 36&#960; antiaromaticity. In addition, the oxidation of 7 with PbO2 allowed for formation of its two&#8208;electron oxidized species 9 that exhibited a diatropic ring&#8208;current effect due to the global H&#252;ckel 34&#960; aromaticity. This work has demonstrated that meso&#8208;free large expanded porphyrins can be a promising platform to produce novel fused porphyrinoids.

         <title>An Efficient Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Nickel Catalyst for the Light Driven Methanation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26476-26482, December 13, 2021. </description>

A Ni&#8208;based catalyst derived from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 was synthesized and studied for the photothermal methanation reaction. The catalyst shows high performance for CH4 production under visible&#8208;IR irradiation. The catalyst also shows high stability and excellent recyclability after several consecutive reaction cycles.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a highly active and stable metal&#8208;organic framework derived Ni&#8208;based catalyst for the photothermal reduction of CO2 to CH4. Through the controlled pyrolysis of MOF&#8208;74 (Ni), the nature of the carbonaceous species and therefore photothermal performance can be tuned. CH4 production rates of 488&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8208;visible&#8208;IR irradiation are achieved when the catalyst is prepared under optimized conditions. No particle aggregation or significant loss of activity were observed after ten consecutive reaction cycles or more than 12&#8197;hours under continuous flow configuration. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we performed an outdoor experiment under ambient solar irradiation, demonstrating the potential of our catalyst to reduce CO2 to CH4 using only solar energy.

         <title>Enantioselective Tertiary Electrophile (Hetero)Benzylation: Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Substitution of Isoprene Monoxide with Arylacetates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26495-26499, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective benzylation of racemic isoprene monoxide is achieved through a two&#8208;step Pd&#8208;catalyzed substitution&#8211;decarboxylation strategy. A variety of electron&#8208;poor (hetero)arylacetates can be used as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to give products with acyclic quaternary stereocenters in 80&#8211;96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
The enantioselective generation of quaternary carbon centers remains challenging but is of growing importance for the preparation of functional molecules. Metal catalyzed allylic alkylations of tertiary electrophiles can provide access to these substructures but remain generally incompatible with organometallic benzyl nucleophiles. Here we demonstrate that electron&#8208;deficient arylacetates can serve as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to generate enantioenriched acyclic molecules containing a quaternary carbon center via a two&#8208;step substitution&#8211;decarboxylation process using isoprene monoxide. Products are often obtained in &gt;90&#8201;% ee using a commercially available catalyst. An array of electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups on the arylacetate moiety are tolerated. The lactone generated by the initial substitution reaction can be used in further stereoselective transformations to prepare molecules with acyclic vicinal quaternary stereocenters.

A metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroaminocarbonylation of alkynes with amines and 1 atm of CO is reported, offering a novel and complementary platform for accessing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. This synergistic protocol facilitates an unprecedented sequential hydroaminocarbonylation/radical alkylation process with tertiary and secondary alkyl boronate esters.







Abstract
A metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the selective and divergent aminocarbonylation of alkynes with amines and 1 atm of CO is reported. This synergistic protocol not only enables the Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroaminocarbonylation of alkynes to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, but also facilitates a sequential four&#8208;component hydroaminocarbonylation/radical alkylation in the presence of tertiary and secondary alkyl boronate esters, which allows for straightforward conversion of alkynes into corresponding amides. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that a photoinduced oxidative insertion of aniline and CO into nickel followed by a migratory insertion of (carbamoyl)nickel species could be involved.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MXene&#8208;Polymer Heterostructure with Ordered In&#8208;Plane Mesochannels for High&#8208;Performance Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26528-26534, December 13, 2021. </description>

This communication reports a bottom&#8208;up approach to a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;polydopamine heterostructure with ordered in&#8208;plane cylindrical mesochannels. The resultant 2D heterostructure shows top&#8208;level CDI performance in its application as electrode material for capacitive deionization.







Abstract
The application of traditional electrode materials for high&#8208;performance capacitive deionization (CDI) has been persistently limited by their low charge&#8208;storage capacities, excessive co&#8208;ion expulsion and slow salt removal rates. Here we report a bottom&#8208;up approach to the preparation of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;polydopamine heterostructure having ordered in&#8208;plane mesochannels (denoted as mPDA/MXene). Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) monolayers on MXene nanosheets leads to the mPDA/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits several unique features: (1)&#8197;MXene undergoes reversible ion intercalation/deintercalation and possesses high conductivity; (2)&#8197;mPDA layers establish redox capacitive characteristics and Na+ selectivity, and also help to prevent self&#8208;stacking and oxidation of MXene; (3)&#8197;in&#8208;plane mesochannels enable the smooth transport of ions at the internal spaces of this stacked 2D material. When applied as an electrode material for CDI, mPDA/MXene nanosheets exhibit top&#8208;level CDI performance and cycling stability compared to those of the so far reported 2D materials. Our study opens an avenue for the rational construction of MXene&#8208;organic hybrid heterostructures, and further motivates the development of high&#8208;performance CDI electrode materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Deoxygenative Alkynylation of Tertiary Amides Enabled by Iridium/Copper Bimetallic Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26604-26609, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Ir/Cu bimetallic relay catalysis was developed to achieve the challenging asymmetric deoxygenative alkynylation of inert amides under mild conditions, affording a series of synthetically important chiral propargylamines in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A variety of inert tertiary amides have been successfully transformed into synthetically important chiral propargylamines in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities via a relayed sequence of Ir catalyzed partial reduction and Cu/GARPHOS catalyzed asymmetric alkynylation with terminal alkynes. The reaction was readily extended to some drug molecules and the transformations of representative products have been demonstrated, thus attesting the practical utilities and the robust nature of the protocol.

The reduction of white phosphorus by an aluminum(I) anion is explored. The four&#8208;electron reduction product serves as a means of phosphine gas production on exposure to ammonia.







Abstract
By employing the highly reducing aluminyl complex [K{(NON)Al}]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene), we demonstrate the controlled formation of P42&#8722; and P44&#8722; complexes from white phosphorus, and chemically reversible inter&#8208;conversion between them. The tetra&#8208;anion features a unique planar &#960;&#8208;bonded structure, with the incorporation of the K+ cations implicit in the use of the anionic nucleophile offering additional stabilization of the unsaturated isomer of the P44&#8722;fragment. This complex is extremely reactive, acting as a source of P3&#8722;: exposure to ammonia leads to the release of phosphine (PH3) under mild conditions (room temperature and pressure), which contrast with those necessitated for the direct combination of P4 and NH3 (&gt;5 kbar and &gt;250&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C&#8722;Ge Coupling of Aryl/Alkenyl Electrophiles with Chlorogermanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26571-26576, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new C&#8722;Ge bond&#8208;forming framework was established, which bridges a gap between a recently developed mild coupling technique and organogermane chemistry. The method provides a mild approach for the synthesis of both aryl and alkenyl germanes, with improved molecular diversity and structural complexity, using readily available carbon electrophiles and chlorogermanes as starting materials.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling has emerged as a promising tool for molecular synthesis; however, current studies have focused mainly on forging C&#8722;C bonds. We report a cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;Ge coupling reaction and thereby demonstrate the possibility of constructing organogermanes from carbon electrophiles and chlorogermanes. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers access to both aryl and alkenyl germanes. Electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl electrophiles, as well as cyclic and acyclic alkenyl electrophiles, were coupled. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, incorporation of the &#8208;GeR3 moiety into complex biologically active molecules, and derivatization of formed organogermanes are demonstrated.

Chiral heterogeneous Sc catalysts that demonstrate excellent activity and selectivity for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions of isatins with indoles have been developed. Noncovalent interactions between chiral Sc complexes and heteropoly acid&#8208;anchored amine&#8208;functionalized SiO2 as support were utilized for the preparation. Continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a biologically active compound was achieved by tuning the chiral ligands.







Abstract
While continuous&#8208;flow reactions with chiral heterogeneous catalysts provide a highly efficient method to synthesize optically active compounds, chiral heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis has been less extensively explored. We have developed the first example of chiral heterogeneous Sc catalysts, which demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions of isatins with indoles. Noncovalent interactions between chiral Sc complexes and heteropoly acid&#8208;anchored amine&#8208;functionalized SiO2 as support were utilized for the synthesis. The heteropoly acid was found to be crucial for the preparation, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts. The chiral ligand could be easily tuned without chemical modification and the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a biologically active compound was achieved.

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of an Isolable Nickelacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 51, Page 26518-26522, December 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pincer scaffold allows the isolation of a nickelacyclobutane and a detailed study of its reactivity. The cycle slowly undergoes an apparent beta&#8208;elimination reaction in non&#8208;polar solvents; exposure to additional ligands leads to selective ring cleavage along either the cyclopropanation or the olefin metathesis pathway. These results give insight into the divergent reactivity of metallacyclobutane intermediates.







Abstract
Nickelacyclobutanes are mostly invoked as reactive intermediates in the reaction of nickel carbenes and olefins to yield cyclopropanes. Nevertheless, early work suggested that other decomposition routes such as &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and even metathesis could be accessible. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of a stable pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane incorporated in a pincer complex. The coordination of different coligands to the nickelacyclobutane determines its selective decomposition along cyclopropanation, metathesis or apparent &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination pathways. DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism of these different pathways.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Concise and Stereoselective Total Synthesis of the Tricyclic Prostaglandin D2 Metabolite Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise and stereoselective total synthesis of the clinically relevant tricyclic prostaglandin D  2  metabolite (tricyclic&#8208;PGDM) methyl ester in racemic form was accomplished in 8 steps from a readily available known cyclopentene&#8208;diol derivative. The synthesis features a nickel&#8208;catalyzed Ueno&#8208;Stork&#8208;type dicarbofunctionalization to generate two consecutive stereocenters, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative spirolactonization to build the core oxaspirolactone, and a  Z  &#8208;selective cross metathesis to introduce the (  Z  )&#8208;3&#8208;butenoate side chain, a group challenging to introduce through traditional Wittig protocols and troublesome for the two previous total syntheses. A general  Z  &#8208;selective cross metathesis protocol to construct (  Z  )&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters was also developed that has broad functional group tolerance and high stereoselectivity. Additionally, our synthesis already accumulated 75 mg of valuable material for an  18  O tricyclic&#8208;PGDM based assay used in clinical settings for inflammation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Ordered Inverse Opal Structures Synthesized from Shape&#8208;Controlled Nanocrystal Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conditions for the co&#8208;assembly of shape&#8208;controlled nanocrystals and templating polystyrene spheres into crack&#8208;free highly ordered macroporous structures preserving the functional and structural properties of the nanocrystals were determined. This opens the doors to numerous opportunities in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and photocatalysis, the latter of which was demonstrated and optimized.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional ordered porous materials known as inverse opal films (IOFs) were synthesized using nanocrystals with precisely defined morphologies. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of the volume fraction ratio and electrostatic interactions between nanocrystals and polystyrene templating particles enabled the formation of highly ordered crack&#8208;free photonic structures. The synthetic strategy was first demonstrated using titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals of different shapes and then generalized to assemble nanocrystals of other functional materials, such as indium tin oxide and zinc&#8208;doped ferrite. Tunable photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 IOFs, modulated through the choice of the shape of TiO2 nanocrystals in conjunction with selecting desired macroscopic features of the IOF, was further explored. In particular, enhanced activity is observed for crack&#8208;free, highly ordered IOFs whose photonic properties can improve light absorption via the slow light effect. This study opens new opportunities in designing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale porous nanoarchitectures having enhanced performance in a variety of applications.

         <title>Correlating Reaction Dynamics and Size Change during the Photomechanical Transformation of 9&#8208;Methylanthracene Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomechanical crystals composed of 9&#8208;methylanthracene molecules were investigated by Daichi Kitagawa, Christopher J. Bardeen, Seiya Kobatake, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202114089). The crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. Moreover, the quantitative connection between molecular reaction kinetics and mechanical response in well&#8208;defined single crystals provides a new benchmark for analyzing these photomechanical materials.

         <title>Tetraaryldiborane(4) Can Emit Dual Fluorescence Responding to the Structural Change around the B&#8722;B Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue/orange dual fluorescence properties of tetramesityldiborane(4) are reported by Yoshiaki Shoji, Yasuhiro Ikabata et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113549). Theoretical calculations showed that the diborane(4) in the S1 state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the blue or orange fluorescence, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Blue/orange dual fluorescence properties of tetramesityldiborane(4) are reported by Yoshiaki Shoji, Yasuhiro Ikabata et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202113549"&gt;10.1002/anie.202113549&lt;/a&gt;). Theoretical calculations showed that the diborane(4) in the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the blue or orange fluorescence, respectively. The relative intensity of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, highlighting the potential of the diborane(4) as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.

         <title>A Biomimetic Approach for Spatially Controlled Cell Membrane Engineering Using Fusogenic Spherical Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion of extracellular vesicles to cell contributes to many critical biological pathways. Inspired by the natural fusion process, Hang Xing et&#8197;al. have developed a liposome fusion&#8208;based transport strategy, termed as LiFT, that enables incorporating a variety of functional moieties onto both external and internal surfaces of cell membrane with precise orientation control (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111647). By using LiFT, asymmetric DNA modifications with orthogonal functionalities on each side of cell membrane is demonstrated, realizing applications such as heterotypic cell assembly and intracellular metabolites detection.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subsurface oxygen in oxide&#8208;derived Cu is evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as reported by Hsin&#8208;Yi Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111021). The results point out that after reducing the Cu oxide precursor, two types of oxygen species, (i) oxygen staying at lattice defect and/or vacancies in the surface&#8208;most region and (ii) interstitial oxygen intercalated in metal structure, are embedded between the fully reduce metallic surface and the Cu2O buried beneath. This study adds the convincing support for the subsurface oxygen formation.

Binary mesocrystals demonstrate the combination of nanocrystals from different materials within a highly ordered manner. While nanocubes appear to be simple in their geometry, they can arrange in various ways into a complex entity which not only directs its habitus but also its properties. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112461), Helmut C&#246;lfen et&#8197;al. report on the formation and structural analysis of micrometer sized two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional binary particle assemblies revealing their mesocrystalline nature and highlighting their importance within the growing field of metamaterials.

         <title>Highly Elastic Interconnected Porous Hydrogels through Self&#8208;Assembled Templating for Solar Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet effective method, self&#8208;assembled templating (SAT), is developed to synthesize 3D large&#8208;scale, highly interconnected porous hydrogels (IPH). IPHs exhibit rapid water transport ability, quick shape recovery, and durable mechanical features, showing a promising method to scale up hydrogel solar evaporators for practical clean water production.







Abstract
Interfacial evaporation using porous hydrogels has demonstrated highly effective solar evaporation performance under natural sunlight to ensure an affordable clean water supply. However, it remains challenging to realize scalable and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use hydrogel materials with durable mechanical properties. Here, self&#8208;assembled templating (SAT) is developed as a simple yet effective method to fabricate large&#8208;scale elastic hydrogel evaporators with excellent desalination performance. The highly interconnected porous structure of the hydrogels with low tortuosity and tunable pore size enables high level of tunability on the water transport rate. With superior elasticity, the porous hydrogels are easy to process with a rapid shape recovery after being rolled, folded, and twisted over hundred times, and exhibit highly effective and stable evaporation with an evaporation rate of &#8776;2.8&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and &#8776;90&#8201;% solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. It is anticipated that this SAT strategy, without the typical need for freeze&#8208;drying, will accelerate the industrialization of hydrogel solar evaporators for practical applications.

         <title>Dynamic Structural Changes and Thermodynamics in Phase Separation Processes of an Intrinsically Disordered&#8211;Ordered Protein Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastin&#8208;like proteins (ELPs) undergo reversible coacervation above a certain transition temperature. The thermodynamic analysis of temperature&#8208;dependent circular dichroism of ELPs of different chain&#8208;length revealed that this is preceded by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step increase of &#946;&#8208;turn structure. When a certain threshold is reached, phase separation occurs. The conformational ratio in the assembled protein particles still corresponds to this threshold.







Abstract
Elastin&#8208;like proteins (ELPs) are biologically important proteins and models for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and dynamic structural transitions associated with coacervates and liquid&#8211;liquid phase transitions. However, the conformational status below and above coacervation temperature and its role in the phase separation process is still elusive. Employing matrix least&#8208;squares global Boltzmann fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)20, (VPGVG)40, and (VPGVG)60, we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a certain number of repeat units has acquired &#946;&#8208;turn conformation (in our sequence setting a threshold of approx. 20&#8197;repeat units). The character of the differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this fraction of &#946;&#8208;turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly.

     alt="Dynamic Structural Changes and Thermodynamics in Phase Separation Processes of an Intrinsically Disordered&#8211;Ordered Protein Model"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elastin-like proteins (ELPs) undergo reversible coacervation above a certain transition temperature. The thermodynamic analysis of temperature-dependent circular dichroism of ELPs of different chain-length revealed that this is preceded by a step-by-step increase of &#946;-turn structure. When a certain threshold is reached, phase separation occurs. The conformational ratio in the assembled protein particles still corresponds to this threshold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elastin-like proteins (ELPs) are biologically important proteins and models for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and dynamic structural transitions associated with coacervates and liquid&#8211;liquid phase transitions. However, the conformational status below and above coacervation temperature and its role in the phase separation process is still elusive. Employing matrix least-squares global Boltzmann fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;, (VPGVG)&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;, and (VPGVG)&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a certain number of repeat units has acquired &#946;-turn conformation (in our sequence setting a threshold of approx. 20&#8197;repeat units). The character of the differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this fraction of &#946;-turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly. Such conformational thresholds may also have a role in other protein assembly processes with implications for the design of protein-based smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Nanographene&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework as a Stable and Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with desirable organic units furnishes advanced materials with unique functionalities. As an emerging class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, sp  2  &#8208;carbon&#8211;conjugated COFs provide a facile platform to build highly stable and crystalline porous polymers. . Herein, a 2D olefin&#8208;linked COF was prepared by employing nanographene, namely, dibenzo[  hi  ,  st  ]ovalene (DBOV), as a building block. The DBOV&#8208;COF exhibits unique ABC&#8208;stacked lattices, enhanced stability, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility of ~0.6 cm  2  &#183;V  &#8208;1  &#183;s  &#8208;1  inferred from ultrafast terahertz conductivity measurements. The ABC&#8208;stacking structure was revealed by the high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. DBOV&#8208;COF demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic activity in hydroxylation, which was attributed to the exposure of narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap DBOV cores in the COF pores, in conjunction with efficient charge transport following light absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Watching Microwave&#8208;Induced Microscopic Hot Spots via the Thermosensitive Fluorescence of Eu/Tb mixed Metal Organic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hypothesis of microscopic hot spots is widely used to explain the unique microwave (MW) effect in material science and chemical engineering, but it has not yet been directly measured. The present study uses Eu/Tb mixed metal organic complexes as nano thermometers to probe the intrinsic temperature of MW&#8208;absorbing particles in MW field based on the thermosensitive fluorescent spectra. According to the measurement results of the temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interphase, we derive an MW&#8208;irradiated energy transfer model to predict the extent of microscopic hot spots. The fluorescent experimental results agree with the model predictions that the MW&#8208;induced temperature gradient can be enlarged by increasing MW intensity, as well as the dielectric loss and size of particles. Conversely, the increase in the thermal conductivity and the dielectric loss of liquid weakens the temperature gradient. This fundamental study enables precise control of MW&#8208;assisted synthesis and MW&#8208;responsive techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite for combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequential control of exogenous chemical events inside cells is a promising way to regulate cell functions and fate. Herein we report a DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite (ZMF), achieving combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy. The promoter&#8208;like ZMF decomposed in response to intratumoral glutathione to release a sufficient quantity of metal ions, thus promoting cascade DNA/RNA cleavage and free radical generation. Two kinds of DNAzymes were designed for sequential cascade enzymatic reaction, in which metal ions functioned as cofactors. The primary DNAzyme self&#8208;cleaved the DNA chain with Zn2+ as cofactor, and produced the secondary DNAzyme; the secondary DNAzyme afterwards cleaved the EGR&#8208;1 mRNA, and thus downregulated the expression of target EGR&#8208;1 protein, achieving DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Meanwhile, the released Zn2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ induced Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions, during which free radicals were catalytically generated and efficient chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy was achieved. In a breast cancer mouse model, the administration of DNA nanocomplex led to a significant therapeutic efficacy of tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Construction of well&#8208;defined sulfur&#8208;rich macromolecules in a facile manner is an interesting but challenging topic. Herein, we disclose how to readily construct well&#8208;defined triblock sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers via self&#8208;switchable isothiocyanates/episulfides copolymerization and air&#8208;assisted oxidative coupling strategy. During self&#8208;switchable polymerization, alternating copolymerization of isothiocyanate and episulfide occurs initially due to the lower energy barrier for isothiocyanate insertion with respect to successive episulfide ring&#8208;opening. After exhaustion of isothiocyanate, ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfide initiates, providing diblock polymers. Subsequent exposing the reaction to air leads to a quantificational transform of diblock copolymers into triblock thermoplastic elastomers. This protocol can be extended to diverse isothiocyanates and episulfides, allowing fine tailor of the performance for the produced sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic molecules are promising functional materials for a wide range of applications, especially in organic electronics. However, their largely hydrophobic nature has impeded further applications. As such, imparting high solubility/hydrophilicity to polycyclic aromatic molecules leads to breakthrough in this research field. Herein, we report the synthesis of diazapentabenzocorannulenium, a cationic nitrogen&#8208;embedded buckybowl bearing a central imidazolium core, by a bottom&#8208;up strategy from polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide. X&#8208;ray crystallography analyses have revealed a bowl&#8208;shape molecular structure that is capable of forming charge&#8208;segregated one&#8208;dimensional columns by bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl packing. In addition to its fluorescence capabilities and high dispersibility in water, the molecule was found to selectively localize in the mitochondria of various tumor cells, showing potential as viable mitochondria&#8208;selective fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Alkylation of Alkenyl Acetates with Alkyl Bromides by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic alkylation of stable alkenyl C&#8722;O electrophiles is synthetically appealing, but studies to date have typically focused on the reactions with alkyl Grignard reagents. We here report a cross&#8208;electrophile reaction of alkenyl acetates with alkyl bromides. This work has enabled a new method for the synthesis of aliphatic alkenes from alkenyl acetates to be established that can be used to add more structural complexity and molecular diversity with enhanced functionality tolerance. The method allows for a gram&#8208;scale reaction and modification of biologically active molecules, and it affords access to useful building blocks. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the Ni(I) species plays an essential role for the success of the coupling of these two reactivity&#8208;mismatched electrophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Supramolecular Polymer Constituted of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the creation of next&#8208;generation organic electronic materials, the integration of &#960;&#8208;systems has recently become a central theme. Such functional materials can be assembled by supramolecular polymerization when aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems are used as monomers, and the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymer strongly depend on the electronic structure of the monomers. Here, we demonstrate the construction of a supramolecular polymer consisting of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer. An amide&#8208;functionalized Ni(II) norcorrole derivative formed a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, ensuring the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation, which results in higher charge mobility along the tightly bound linear aggregates than that of the aromatic analogue composed of Zn(II) porphyrins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An energy transfer&#8208;based signal amplification relay concept enabling transmission of bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable coumarins to yellow/red emitting cyanine frames is presented.

These energy transfer dyads sharing the same donor moiety together with their parent donor molecule allowed three&#8208;color imaging of intracellular targets using one single excitation source with separate emission windows.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Independent Molecular Weight Determination of Polymers Based on a Truly Universal Calibration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows for accurate molecular weight calibration and determination that can be corrected for solvent influences. Polystyrene and poly(ethylene glycol) standards have been used to calibrate DOSY diffusion data for a variety of solvents, showing a high correlation of data when the bulk viscosity of the solvent is accounted for following the Stokes&#8208;Einstein equation. In this way, a type of universal calibration is introduced that allows for determinations of average molecular weight that are at least as accurate as those of traditional size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC), if not better. Further, we demonstrate that DOSY calibrations can be used between laboratories, hence removing the need for individual calibration of setups as currently done.</dc:description>

         <title>Crosslinked polypeptide films via RAFT mediated continuous assembly of polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polypeptide coatings are a cornerstone in the field of surface modification due to their widespread biological potential. As their properties are dictated by their structural features, subsequent control thereof using unique fabrication strategies is important. Herein, we report a facile method of precisely creating densely crosslinked polypeptide films with unusually high random coil conformations through continuous assembly polymerization  via  reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (CAP&#8208;RAFT). CAP&#8208;RAFT was fundamentally investigated using methacrylated poly&#8208;  L  &#8208;lysine (PLLMA) and methacrylated poly&#8208;  L  &#8208;glutamic acid (PLGMA). Careful technique refinement resulted in films up to 36.1 &#177; 1.1 nm thick which could be increased to 94.9 &#177; 8.2 nm after using this strategy multiple times. PLLMA and PLGMA films were found to have 30&#8208;50% random coil conformations. Degradation by enzymes present during wound healing reveals potential for applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinone Covalent Organic Framework Hollow Tubes as Binder Microadditives in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks could have implications as microadditives of binders (&#8776;1&#8197;wt&#8201;% in cathode) and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow tubes have been prepared as model microadditives to obtain a high&#8208;performance binder in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The exploration of new application forms of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in Li&#8722;S batteries that can overcome drawbacks like low conductivity or high loading when typically applied as sulfur host materials (mostly &#8776;20 to &#8776;40&#8197;wt&#8201;% loading in cathode) is desirable to maximize their low&#8208;density advantage to obtain lightweight, portable, or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices. Here, we establish that COFs could have implications as microadditives of binders (&#8776;1&#8197;wt&#8201;% in cathode), and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow tubes have been prepared as model microadditives. The microadditives can strengthen the basic properties of the binder and spontaneously immobilize and catalytically convert lithium polysulfides, as proved by density functional calculations, thus showing almost doubly enhanced reversible capacity compared with that of the bare electrode.

         <title>An Unsymmetrical, Cyclic Diborene Based on a Chelating CAAC Ligand and its Small&#8208;Molecule Activation and Rearrangement Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doubly CAAC&#8208;supported unsymmetrical, cyclic diborene was obtained via an in situ, one&#8208;pot synthesis protocol. This diborene features a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. The reactivity of this diborene with small molecules, including [AuCl(PCy3)], durylborane, white phosphorus (P4) and terminal alkynes, as well as the thermal rearrangement chemistry, were investigated.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of a CAAC&#8208;stabilized, unsymmetrical, cyclic diborene was achieved via consecutive two&#8208;electron reduction steps from an adduct of CAAC and B2Br4(SMe2)2. Theoretical studies revealed that this diborene has a considerably smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than those of reported NHC&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;supported diborenes. Complexation of the diborene with [AuCl(PCy3)] afforded two diborene&#8211;AuI &#960;&#8197;complexes, while reaction with DurBH2, P4 and a terminal acetylene led to the cleavage of B&#8722;H, P&#8722;P, and C&#8722;C &#960;&#8197;bonds, respectively. Thermal rearrangement of the diborene gave an electron&#8208;rich cyclic alkylideneborane, which readily coordinated to AgI via its B=C double bond.

         <title>Condensed Supramolecular Helices: The Twisted Sisters of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bile salt biosurfactant with low molecular weight can self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular helices by interaction with oppositely charged polymers. A controlled condensation of the supramolecular helices into DNA&#8208;like hexagonally packed bundles and toroids can be achieved when using block copolymers of opposite charge and increasing the bile salt content.







Abstract
Condensation of DNA helices into hexagonally packed bundles and toroids represents an intriguing example of functional organization of biological macromolecules at the nanoscale. The condensation models are based on the unique polyelectrolyte features of DNA, however here we could reproduce a DNA&#8208;like condensation with supramolecular helices of small chiral molecules, thereby demonstrating that it is a more general phenomenon. We show that the bile salt sodium deoxycholate can form supramolecular helices upon interaction with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes of homopolymer or block copolymers. At higher order, a controlled hexagonal packing of the helices into DNA&#8208;like bundles and toroids could be accomplished. The results disclose unknown similarities between covalent and supramolecular non&#8208;covalent helical polyelectrolytes, which inspire visionary ideas of constructing supramolecular versions of biological macromolecules. As drug nanocarriers the polymer&#8211;bile salt superstructures would get advantage of a complex chirality at molecular and supramolecular levels, whose effect on the nanocarrier assisted drug efficiency is a still unexplored fascinating issue.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Friedel&#8211;Crafts Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploitation of the inherent strain energy of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts inspired synthesis of a unique library of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles is described. The observed dearomatized intermediate of this reaction can be converted to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation or trapped as the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct to generate complex sp3&#8208;rich architectures.







Abstract
The identification of spiro N&#8208;heterocycles as scaffolds that display structural novelty, three&#8208;dimensionality, beneficial physicochemical properties, and enable the controlled spatial disposition of substituents has led to a surge of interest in utilizing these compounds in drug discovery programs. Herein, we report the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven Friedel&#8211;Crafts spirocyclization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;tethered (hetero)aryls for the synthesis of a unique library of azetidine spiro&#8208;tetralins. The reaction was discovered to proceed through an unexpected interrupted Friedel&#8211;Crafts mechanism, generating a highly complex azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold. This dearomatized intermediate, formed exclusively as a single diastereomer, can be subsequently converted to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation of the tertiary amine, or trapped as a Diels&#8211;Alder adduct in one&#8208;pot. The rapid assembly of molecular complexity demonstrated in these reactions highlights the potential of the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven spirocyclization strategy to be utilized in the synthesis of medicinally relevant scaffolds.

         <title>Continuous Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes with Modifiable Sites for Optimized Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with stable carbon&#8211;carbon linkages and chemically modifiable pores were shaped into continuous membranes, which are capable of separating industrially valuable gas mixtures, including H2/N2 and CO2/N2. With modulation of the pore structure or chemical environment, the separation performance of continuous PAF membranes exceeded their corresponding Robeson's upper bounds.







Abstract
Continuous microporous membranes are widely studied for gas separation, due to their low energy premium and strong molecular specificity. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with their exceptional stability and structural flexibility are suited to a wide range of separations. Main&#8208;stream PAF&#8208;based membranes are usually prepared with polymeric matrices, but their discrete entities and boundary defects weaken their selectivity and permeability. The synthesis of continuous PAF membranes is still a major challenge because PAFs are insoluble. Herein, we successfully synthesized a continuous PAF membrane for gas separation. Both pore size and chemistry of the PAF membrane were modified by ion&#8208;exchange, resulting in good selectivity and permeance for the gas mixtures H2/N2 and CO2/N2. The membrane with Br&#8722; as a counter ion in the framework exhibited a H2/N2 selectivity of 72.7 with a H2 permeance of 51844 gas permeation units (GPU). When the counter ions were replaced by BF4&#8722;, the membrane showed a CO2 permeance of 23058&#8197;GPU, and an optimized CO2/N2 selectivity of 60.0. Our results show that continuous PAF membranes with modifiable pores are promising for various gas separation situations.

         <title>Multiplexed Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Ligand Binding Assays by Affinity Labeling and DNA Sequence Analysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;barcoded ligands to target proteins allows ligand&#8208;binding assays using DNA as a label. Pooled sample manipulation and DNA sequence detection enabled by DNA encoding yields quantitative binding assays amenable to both ligand displacement and direct binding formats.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule binding assays to target proteins are a core component of drug discovery and development. While a number of assay formats are available, significant drawbacks still remain in cost, sensitivity, and throughput. To improve assays by capitalizing on the power of DNA sequence analysis, we have developed an assay method that combines DNA encoding with split&#8208;and&#8208;pool sample handling. The approach involves affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;linked ligands to a protein target. Critically, the labeling event assesses ligand binding and enables subsequent pooling of several samples. Application of a purifying selection on the pool for protein&#8208;labeled DNAs allows detection of ligand binding by quantification of DNA barcodes. We demonstrate the approach in both ligand displacement and direct binding formats and demonstrate its utility in determination of relative ligand affinity, profiling ligand specificity, and high&#8208;throughput small&#8208;molecule screening.

         <title>Ammonium Pertechnetate in Mixtures of Trifluoromethanesulfonic Acid and Trifluoromethanesulfonic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium pertechnetate is reduced to a green technetium(V) complex when left in triflic acid, while yellow pertechnetyl triflate and a purple TcVI species form as intermediates. In the presence of excess pertechnetate, the ammonium salt of a pertechnetato&#8211;oxotechnetate, can be isolated.







Abstract
Ammonium pertechnetate reacts in mixtures of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid under final formation of ammonium pentakis(trifluoromethanesulfonato)oxidotechnetate(V), (NH4)2[TcO(OTf)5]. The reaction proceeds only at exact concentrations and under the exclusion of air and moisture via pertechnetyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, [TcO3(OTf)], and intermediate TcVI species. 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been used to study the TcVII compound and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 99Tc&#8197;NMR and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) experiments indicate the presence of the reduced technetium species. In moist air, (NH4)2[TcO(OTf)5] slowly hydrolyses under formation of the tetrameric oxidotechnetate(V) (NH4)4[{TcO(TcO4)4}4] &#8901;10&#8201;H2O. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to determine the solid&#8208;state structures. Additionally, UV/Vis absorption and IR spectra as well as quantum chemical calculations confirm the identity of the species.

The reaction proceeds only at exact concentrations and under the exclusion of air and moisture via pertechnetyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, [TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OTf)], and intermediate Tc&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt; species. &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been used to study the Tc&lt;sup&gt;VII&lt;/sup&gt; compound and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc&#8197;NMR and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) experiments indicate the presence of the reduced technetium species. In moist air, (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TcO(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] slowly hydrolyses under formation of the tetrameric oxidotechnetate(V) (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[{TcO(TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] &#8901;10&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography was used to determine the solid-state structures. Additionally, UV/Vis absorption and IR spectra as well as quantum chemical calculations confirm the identity of the species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Targeted DNA Crosslinking with cis&#8208;Platinum(II)&#8208;Modified Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid click chemistry has been used for the development of cis&#8208;platinum(II)/triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide hybrid biomaterials. This modular approach allows the incorporation of cis&#8208;platinum(II) at practically any location within the probe strand. These hybrid biomaterials display discrete and efficient crosslinking of purine&#8208;rich genetic elements of the GFP gene.







Abstract
Limitations of clinical platinum(II) therapeutics include systemic toxicity and inherent resistance. Modern approaches, therefore, seek new ways to deliver active platinum(II) to discrete nucleic acid targets. In the field of antigene therapy, triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) have attracted interest for their ability to specifically recognise extended duplex DNA targets. Here, we report a click chemistry based approach that combines alkyne&#8208;modified TFOs with azide&#8208;bearing cis&#8208;platinum(II) complexes&#8212;based on cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin motifs&#8212;to generate a library of PtII&#8208;TFO hybrids. These constructs can be assembled modularly and enable directed platinum(II) crosslinking to purine nucleobases on the target sequence under the guidance of the TFO. By covalently incorporating modifications of thiazole orange&#8212;a known DNA&#8208;intercalating fluorophore&#8212;into PtII&#8208;TFOs constructs, enhanced target binding and discrimination between target and off&#8208;target sequences was achieved.

         <title>A Modular Access to 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutylboronic Esters by Consecutive Radical Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the strain inherent in a cyclobutyl ring to counteract the stabilization of a radical adjacent to a boronic ester allows the synthesis a broad variety of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters.







Abstract
A modular approach to substituted cyclobutylboronic esters is described. It proceeds by successive intermolecular radical additions of xanthates to pinacolato 1&#8208;cyclobutenylboronate and to pinacolato bicyclo[1.1.0]but&#8208;1&#8208;ylboronate. Success hinges on tuning the stability of the &#945;&#8208;boryl radical by exploiting the stabilizing influence of the trivalent boronic ester and the slightly destabilizing cyclobutane, which increases the &#963;&#8208;character of the radical. Reductive removal of the xanthate group finally provides a range of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters. The contrast with cyclopropylboronic esters is striking, since the strong destabilization by the highly strained cyclopropane ring allows the first radical addition to take place but not the second. Furthermore, the first adducts are geminal xanthyl boronic esters that can be converted into cyclobutanones. This chemistry furnishes cyclobutylboronic esters that would be quite difficult to obtain otherwise and thus complements existing methods.

         <title>Orchestrating Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide Signaling Molecules for Synergistic Treatment of MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the coexistence and interplay of gaseous signaling molecules in truly physiological and pathological conditions, photoresponsive micelles capable of simultaneously releasing nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been developed by covalent grafting of NO&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine onto CO&#8208;releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone moieties, showing a synergistic antimicrobial activity toward MRSA both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The local delivery of gaseous signaling molecules (GSMs) has shown promising therapeutic potential. However, although GSMs have a subtle interplay in physiological and pathological conditions, the co&#8208;delivery of different GSMs for therapeutic purposes remains unexplored. Herein, we covalently graft a nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine moiety onto the carbon monoxide (CO)&#8208;releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (3&#8208;HF) antenna, resulting in the first NO/CO&#8208;releasing donor. Under visible light irradiation, photo&#8208;mediated co&#8208;release of NO and CO reveals a superior antimicrobial effect toward Gram&#8208;positive bacteria with a combination index of 0.053. The synergy of NO and CO hyperpolarizes and permeabilizes bacterial membranes, which, however, shows negligible hemolysis and no evident toxicity toward normal mammalian cells. Moreover, the co&#8208;release of NO and CO can efficiently treat MRSA infection in a murine skin wound model, showing a better therapeutic capacity than vancomycin.

         <title>Palladium/Ferrierite versus Palladium/SSZ&#8208;13 Passive NOx Adsorbers: Adsorbate&#8208;Controlled Location of Atomically Dispersed Palladium(II) in Ferrierite Determines High Activity and Stability**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium ions in ferrierite zeolite (present majorly as PdII&#8208;OH/1Al sites after 550&#8201;&#176;C air calcination) re&#8208;disperse after air calcination at 800&#8201;&#176;C as predominantly PdII/2Al sites for 1.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pd/H&#8208;FER with a Si/Al ratio of 10:1. The resulting material shows excellent nitric oxide adsorption properties as well as high hydrothermal stability up to 800&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;loaded FER and SSZ&#8208;13 zeolites as low&#8208;temperature passive NOx adsorbers (PNA) are compared under practical conditions. Vehicle cold start exposes the material to CO under a range of concentrations, necessitating a systematic exploration of the effect of CO on the performance of isolated Pd ions in PNA. The NO release temperature of both adsorbers decreases gradually with an increase in CO concentration from a few hundred to a few thousand ppm. This beneficial effect results from local nano&#8208;&#8220;hot spot&#8221; formation during CO oxidation. Dissimilar to Pd/SSZ&#8208;13, increasing the CO concentration above &#8776;1000&#8197;ppm improves the NOx storage significantly for Pd/FER, which was attributed to the presence of Pd ions in FER sites that are shielded from NOx. CO mobilizes this Pd atom to the NOx accessible position where it becomes active for PNA. This behavior explains the very high resistance of Pd/FER to hydrothermal aging: Pd/FER materials survive hydrothermal aging at 800&#8201;&#176;C in 10&#8201;% H2O vapor for 16&#8197;hours with no deterioration in NOx uptake/release behavior. Thus, by allocating Pd ions to the specific microporous pockets in FER, we have produced (hydro)thermally stable and active PNA materials.

         <title>Precatalyst&#8208;Enabled Selectivity: Enantioselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed anti&#8208;Hydrometalative Cyclization of Alkynones to Endo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;cyclic Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented NiH&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and anti&#8208;selective intramolecular coupling of alkynones to construct O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;containing endocyclic allylic alcohols was developed. The choice of metal precursors plays a key role in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. This study offers a new anti&#8208;hydrocyclization mode for enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyclization of alkynones with unparalleled anti&#8208; and endocyclic selectivities is described. The choice of the precatalysts has significant influence in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Using Ni(OTs)2/Phox as a precatalyst and (EtO)2MeSiH as a hydride source, an array of enantioenriched O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;containing heterocyclic tertiary allylic alcohols are obtained in 24&#8211;81&#8201;% yields with 80:20&#8211;99:1 er. Mechanistic investigations and synthetic application are also carried out. This study represents an efficient access to a set of allylic alcohols that are unable to access by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coupling reactions.

         <title>DNA Aptamer&#8211;Cyanine Complexes as Generic Colorimetric Small&#8208;Molecule Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational strategy is introduced to develop label&#8208;free colorimetric assays based on aptamers and cyanine dyes that can detect small molecules for on&#8208;site sensing applications. This dye&#8208;displacement approach is found to be generally applicable to DNA aptamers with diverse sequences, structures, and affinity, enabling the detection of a variety of analytes in a sensitive, selective, and rapid manner.







Abstract
Aptamers are promising biorecognition elements for sensors. However, aptamer&#8208;based assays often lack the requisite levels of sensitivity and/or selectivity because they typically employ structure&#8208;switching aptamers with attenuated affinity and/or utilize reporters that require aptamer labeling or which are susceptible to false positives. Dye&#8208;displacement assays offer a label&#8208;free, sensitive means for overcoming these issues, wherein target binding liberates a dye that is complexed with the aptamer, producing an optical readout. However, broad utilization of these assays has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a rational approach to develop colorimetric cyanine dye&#8208;displacement assays that can be broadly applied to DNA aptamers regardless of their structure, sequence, affinity, or the physicochemical properties of their targets. Our approach should accelerate the development of mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure assays that could be applied for diverse analytical applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Installation of N&#1013;&#8208;Modified Sidechains into Peptide and Protein Scaffolds via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Desulfurative C&#8211;C Bond Formation</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe a rapid light&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming reaction that enables installation of N&#1013;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins at defined positions. Selective for cysteine residues, the method proceeds via interception of free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated desulfurization. The chemistry is operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere, and retains the native stereochemistry at the modified residue.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) enhance the repertoire of protein function and mediate or influence the activity of many cellular processes. The preparation of site&#8208;specifically and homogeneously modified proteins, to apply as tools to understand the biological role of PTMs, is a challenging task. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated desulfurative C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond forming reaction that enables the site&#8208;selective installation of N&#1013;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins of interest. Rapid, operationally simple, and tolerant to ambient atmosphere, we demonstrate the installation of a range of lysine (Lys) PTMs into model peptide systems and showcase the potential of this technology by site&#8208;selectively installing an N&#1013;Ac sidechain into recombinantly expressed ubiquitin (Ub).

         <title>A Photoinduced Dual&#8208;Wavelength Approach for 3D Printing and Self&#8208;healing of Thermosetting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing techniques have been widely used to produce high&#8208;resolution 3D thermosetting materials. However, the lack of repairability of these thermosets leads to the production of waste. In this study, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents are incorporated into resin formulations to allow visible light (405 nm) mediated 3D printing of materials with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the thermosets under UV light (365 nm), which enables reformation of the polymeric network. The self&#8208;healing process can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The impact of the type and concentration of RAFT agents in the polymer network on the healing efficiency is explored. Resins containing RAFT agents enable 3D printing of thermosets with self&#8208;healing properties, broadening the scope of future applications for polymeric thermosets in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinated Anionic Inorganic Module &#8211; An Efficient Approach Towards Highly Efficient Blue&#8208;Emitting Copper Halide Ionic Hybrid Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper halide based organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid semiconductors exhibit great potentials as light&#8208;emitting materials with excellent structural variety and optical tunability. Among them, copper halide hybrid molecular compounds with discrete inorganic modules are particularly interesting due to their high quantum efficiency, however, synthesizing highly efficient blue&#8208;emitting molecular clusters remains challenging. Here, we report a novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating coordinated anionic inorganic modules in these ionic species. Under such approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures are prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98%. Strong luminescence from the combination of ionic and covalent bonds in these compounds make them ideal candidates as alternative, rare&#8208;earth element free light&#8208;emitting materials for possible use in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

Here, we report a novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating coordinated anionic inorganic modules in these ionic species. Under such approach, a family of strongly blue-emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures are prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98%. Strong luminescence from the combination of ionic and covalent bonds in these compounds make them ideal candidates as alternative, rare-earth element free light-emitting materials for possible use in optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Resolution of Configurationally Stable Zwitterionic Pentacoordinate Silicon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant zwitterions featuring a chiral pentacoordinate silicon moiety is described. Their stability toward moisture and aerobic conditions allowed their optical resolution by means of chiral HPLC, which constitutes a premiere in the chemistry of organosilicon compounds. Studies on the kinetics of racemisation of enantiomerically pure substrates attest for their high configurational stabilities in solution.







Abstract
Stereogenic silicon centres in functionalised tetracoordinated organosilanes generally exhibit very high configurational stability under neutral conditions. This stability drops completely when higher coordination states of the silicon centre are reached due to rapid substituent exchange. Herein we describe the synthesis of chiral and neutral pentacoordinate silicon derivatives with high configurational stability. The zwitterionic nature of these air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant species allows for the first time their direct and efficient optical resolution using chiral HPLC techniques. By means of this method, pentacoordinate silicon compounds exhibiting high Si&#8208;inversion have been obtained as single enantiomers. A rationalisation of the enantiomerisation pathways has been also carried out using DFT calculations.

         <title>Unravelling Channel Structure&#8211;Diffusivity Relationships in Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic channel structure&#8211;diffusivity relationships in zeolites were unraveled using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. New insights into the mechanism of the enhanced diffusion in hierarchical zeolites were obtained.







Abstract
The development of improved zeolite materials for applications in separation and catalysis requires understanding of mass transport. Herein, diffusion of single molecules is tracked in the straight and sinusoidal channels of the industrially relevant ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. Distinct motion behaviors are observed in zeolite channels with the same geometry, suggesting heterogeneous guest&#8211;host interactions. Quantification of the diffusion heterogeneities in the sinusoidal and straight channels suggests that the geometry of zeolite channels dictates the mobility and motion behavior of the guest molecules, resulting in diffusion anisotropy. The study of hierarchical zeolites shows that the addition of secondary pore networks primarily enhances the diffusivity of sinusoidal zeolite channels, and thus alleviating the diffusion limitations of microporous zeolites.

         <title>Enzyme Control Over Ferric Iron Magnetostructural Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a first&#8208;in&#8208;class stimuli responsive Fe3+ complex that is switched between discrete antiferromagnetically coupled and high&#8208;spin paramagnetic species through the action of a carboxylesterase enzyme. We also demonstrate how enzyme&#8208;mediated switching of Fe3+ magnetic properties offers a mechanistic foundation for new bioresponsive magnetic resonance sensor technology.







Abstract
Fe3+ complexes in aqueous solution can exist as discrete mononuclear species or multinuclear magnetically coupled species. Stimuli&#8208;driven change to Fe3+ speciation represents a powerful mechanistic basis for magnetic resonance sensor technology, but ligand design strategies to exert precision control of aqueous Fe3+ magnetostructural properties are entirely underexplored. In pursuit of this objective, we rationally designed a ligand to strongly favor a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;oxo&#8208;bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled complex, but which undergoes carboxylesterase mediated transformation to a mononuclear high&#8208;spin Fe3+ chelate resulting in substantial T1&#8208;relaxivity increase. The data communicated demonstrate proof of concept for a novel and effective strategy to exert biochemical control over aqueous Fe3+ magnetic, structural, and relaxometric properties.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Selenium Sites on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy has been proposed to synthesize Se single&#8208;atom catalysts anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon substances. The atomically dispersed Se sites with maximum atomic utilization and modulated electronic structures exhibit superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. This work provides a new method to synthesize non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts and opens up new horizons for atomically dispersed nanomaterials.







Abstract
Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single&#8208;atom catalysts have received widespread attention and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non&#8208;metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) via a high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C&#8722;Se&#8722;C bond. Impressively, the obtained single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpasses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. Our discoveries demonstrate the promising prospects for utilizing metal&#8208;free single&#8208;atom&#8208;based materials for efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Rhamnolipid Toxin by Redox Liposome Single Impact Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept showing that the electrochemistry of redox liposomes single impacts is a powerful and efficient analytical technique for sensing target toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria such as Rhamnolipid from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which interacts destructively with the lipid membrane of liposomes. A high sensitivity of sensing has been reached with a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid detected in less than 30&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
The detection of Rhamnolipid virulence factor produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in nosocomial infections is reported by using the redox liposome single impact electrochemistry. Redox liposomes based on 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine as a pure phospholipid and potassium ferrocyanide as an encapsulated redox content are designed for using the interaction of the target toxin with the lipid membrane as a sensing strategy. The electrochemical sensing principle is based on the weakening of the liposomes lipid membrane upon interaction with Rhamnolipid toxin which leads upon impact at an ultramicroelectrode to the breakdown of the liposomes and the release/electrolysis of its encapsulated redox probe. We present as a proof of concept the sensitive and fast sensing of a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid which is detected after less than 30&#8197;minutes of incubation with the liposomes, by the appearing of current spikes in the chronoamperometry measurement.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Porphyrin&#8208;Complex Multi&#8208;Block Co&#8208;Oligomers by Defluorinative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key for sequential on&#8208;surface reaction: A coupling module of CF3 groups can react only when another reactant comes close enough. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and DFT&#8208;based ab initio molecular dynamics calculations allowed us to investigate the properties of the products and the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemical reaction has become a very powerful technique to synthesize nanostructures by linking small molecules in the bottom&#8208;up approach. Given the fact that most reactants are simultaneously activated at certain temperatures, a sequential reaction in a controlled way has remained challenging. Here, we present an on&#8208;surface synthesis of multi&#8208;block co&#8208;oligomers from trifluoromethyl (CF3) substituted porphyrin metal complexes. The oligomerization on Au(111) is demonstrated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Even after the first oligomerization of single monomer unit, the termini of the oligomer keep the CF3 group, which can be used as a reactant for further coupling in a sequential order. Consequently, copper, cobalt, and palladium complexes of bisanthracene&#8208;fused porphyrin oligomers were linked with each other in a designed order.

         <title>Nanoconfinement Engineering over Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Structured Copper towards Efficient Electrocatalytical C&#8722;C coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation between the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion and nanoconfinement effect of Cu hollow multi&#8208;shell structures is reported. As the shell number increases, there is a remarkable enhancement in both selectivity and activity toward C2+ species. Particularly, Cu hollow multi&#8208;shell structures with 3 shells exhibit a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#177;0.3&#8201;% with an impressive C2+ current density of 513.7&#177;0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a neutral electrolyte.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement provides a promising solution to promote electrocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling, by dramatically altering the diffusion kinetics to ensure a high local concentration of C1 intermediates for carbon dimerization. Herein, under the guidance of finite&#8208;element method simulations results, a series of Cu2O hollow multi&#8208;shell structures (HoMSs) with tunable shell numbers were synthesized via Ostwald ripening. When applied in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the in situ formed Cu HoMSs showed a positive correlation between shell numbers and selectivity for C2+ products, reaching a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#177;0.3&#8201;% at a conversion rate of 513.7&#177;0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a neutral electrolyte. Mechanistic studies clarified the confinement effect of HoMSs that superposition of Cu shells leads to a higher coverage of localized CO adsorbate inside the cavity for enhanced dimerization. This work provides valuable insights for the delicate design of efficient C&#8722;C coupling catalysts.

         <title>A Lateral Flow Test for Staphylococcus aureus in Nasal Mucus Using a New DNAzyme as the Recognition Element</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive and specific lateral flow assay using an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme can detect S. aureus in nasal mucus. The assay is simple and can detect the presence or absence of S. aureus by eye with a total assay time of 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological matrices remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the selection and optimization of a new DNAzyme for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and the use of the DNAzyme to develop a simple lateral flow device (LFD) for detection of SA in nasal mucus. The DNAzyme was generated by in vitro selection using a crude extra/intracellular mixture derived from SA, which could be used directly for simple solution or paper&#8208;based fluorescence assays for SA. The DNAzyme was further modified to produce a DNA cleavage fragment that acted as a bridging element to bind DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles to the test line of a LFD, producing a simple colorimetric dipstick test. The LFD was evaluated with nasal mucus samples spiked with SA, and demonstrated that SA detection was possible in minutes with minimal sample processing.

         <title>A Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Dimer of Au3 Superatoms Supported by Interlocked Tridentate Scaffolds Formed in Au18S2(SR)12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au18S2(SR)12, a new gold cluster that can be viewed as an interlocked dimer of Au9S(SR)6 cages, was synthesized using a bulky thiol ligand. Theoretical calculation demonstrated that the Au6 core can be interpreted as a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer of Au3 superatoms.







Abstract
A new sulfur&#8208;containing gold cluster, Au18S2(STipb)12, was serendipitously obtained using the bulky thiol, 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzyl mercaptan (TipbSH), as protecting ligands. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au18S2(STipb)12 has a deformed octahedral Au6 core clutched by two tridentate S[Au2(STipb)2]3 units in an interlocked manner. Based on density functional theory calculations, we propose that the Au6 core with two electrons is better viewed as a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer of Au3(1e) superatoms rather than an electronically closed Au6(2e) superatom. In situ formation of the sulfide anions (S2&#8722;) via C&#8208;S bond breakage is ascribed to the steric repulsion between the TipbS ligands.

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Enabled Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating intramolecular S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent interactions (INIs) for boosting the intrinsic hole mobilities, two simple&#8208;structured dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) were designed and delivered a remarkable efficiency of 21.10&#8201;% with decent device stability in inverted perovskite solar cells, demonstrating the great promise of the INI strategy for accessing high&#8208;performance dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
Intramolecular noncovalent interactions (INIs) have served as a powerful strategy for accessing organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport properties. Herein, we apply the INI strategy for developing dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) by constructing two small&#8208;molecular HTMs featuring an INI&#8208;integrated backbone for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Upon incorporating noncovalent S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction into their simple&#8208;structured backbones, the resulting HTMs, BTORA and BTORCNA, showed self&#8208;planarized backbones, tuned energy levels, enhanced thermal properties, appropriate film morphology, and effective defect passivation. More importantly, the high film crystallinity enables the materials with substantial hole mobilities, thus rendering them as promising dopant&#8208;free HTMs. Consequently, the BTORCNA&#8208;based inverted PVSCs delivered a power conversion efficiency of 21.10&#8201;% with encouraging long&#8208;term device stability, outperforming the devices based on BTRA without S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction (18.40&#8201;%). This work offers a practical approach to designing charge transporting layers with high intrinsic mobilities for high&#8208;performance PVSCs.

Upon incorporating noncovalent S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction into their simple-structured backbones, the resulting HTMs, BTORA and BTORCNA, showed self-planarized backbones, tuned energy levels, enhanced thermal properties, appropriate film morphology, and effective defect passivation. More importantly, the high film crystallinity enables the materials with substantial hole mobilities, thus rendering them as promising dopant-free HTMs. Consequently, the BTORCNA-based inverted PVSCs delivered a power conversion efficiency of 21.10&#8201;% with encouraging long-term device stability, outperforming the devices based on BTRA without S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction (18.40&#8201;%). This work offers a practical approach to designing charge transporting layers with high intrinsic mobilities for high-performance PVSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations Involving the Activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of methods that exploit transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations for the assembly of cyclic systems is steadily growing. This Minireview covers the most relevant cyclization and cycloaddition approaches, discussed from a mechanistic perspective.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using transition&#8208;metal catalysis is among the more attractive transformations of modern synthetic chemistry. In addition to its inherent atom economy, such reactions open unconventional retrosynthetic pathways that can streamline synthetic processes. However, the activation of intrinsically inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and the selection among very similar C&#8722;H bonds, represent highly challenging goals. In recent years there has been notable progress tackling these issues, especially with regard to the development of intermolecular reactions entailing the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Conversely, the assembly of cyclic products from simple acyclic precursors using metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activations has been less explored. Only recently has the number of reports on such annulations started to grow. Herein we give an overview of some of the more relevant advances in this exciting topic.

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Dinitrogen and Nitric Oxide to Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of (electro&#8208;)chemically driven, reductive N2 splitting with nitrogen atom transfer to NO is reported. Nitrous oxide generation directly from dinitrogen and nitric oxide defines a new strategy for direct oxidative nitrogen fixation. Initial coordination of an activating NO ligand prepares the chemically robust ReV nitride for Re&#8801;N/NO radical coupling.







Abstract
Reductive splitting of N2 is an attractive strategy towards nitrogen fixation beyond ammonia at ambient conditions. However, the resulting nitride complexes often suffer from thermodynamic overstabilization hampering functionalization. Furthermore, oxidative nitrogen atom transfer of N2 derived nitrides remains unknown. We here report a ReIV pincer platform that mediates N2 splitting upon chemical reduction or electrolysis with unprecedented yield. The N2 derived ReV nitrides undergo facile nitrogen atom transfer to nitric oxide, giving nitrous oxide nearly quantitatively. Experimental and computational results indicate that outer&#8208;sphere ReN/NO radical coupling is facilitated by the activation of the nitride via initial coordination of NO.

         <title>Engineering a Non&#8208;Natural Photoenzyme for Improved Photon Efficiency**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel HTS engineering platform to optimize photoenzymatic activity. The improvements in variants were correlated to an increase in enzymatic photon efficiency. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a shift from a stepwise to a concerted mechanism. The platform was expanded to improve the synthesis of &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;&#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides.







Abstract
Photoenzymes are biological catalysts that use light to convert starting materials into products. These catalysts require photon absorption for each turnover, making quantum efficiency an important optimization parameter. Flavin&#8208;dependent &#8220;ene&#8221;&#8208;reductases (EREDs) display latent photoenzymatic activity for synthetically valuable hydroalkylations; however, protein engineering has not been used to optimize this non&#8208;natural function. We describe a protein engineering platform for the high throughput optimization of photoenzymes. A single round of engineering results in improved catalytic function toward the synthesis of &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;&#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides. Mechanistic studies show that key mutations can alter the enzyme's excited state dynamics, enhance its photon efficiency, and ultimately increase catalyst performance. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that engineered variants display dramatically decreased radical lifetimes, indicating an evolution toward a concerted mechanism.

         <title>An Expanded 2D Fused Aromatic Network with 90&#8208;Ring Hexagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic network with a honeycomb lattice constituted of 90&#8208;ring hexagons, the largest yet reported, was obtained by solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic networks (2D&#8197;FANs) have emerged as a highly versatile alternative to holey graphene. The synthesis of 2D&#8197;FANs with increasingly larger lattice dimensions will enable new application perspectives. However, the synthesis of larger analogues is mostly limited by lack of appropriate monomers and methods. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterisation and properties of an expanded 2D&#8197;FAN with 90&#8208;ring hexagons, which exceed the largest 2D&#8197;FAN lattices reported to date.

         <title>Conformational Flexibility of the Protein Insertase BamA in the Native Asymmetric Bilayer Elucidated by ESR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is an asymmetric bilayer. The effect of this asymmetry on protein structure and dynamics remains elusive. The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) mediates the folding and insertion of proteins into the outer membrane. Using in situ electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we show that the native outer membrane significantly enhances the dynamics of the BamA insertase of the BAM complex.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) consisting of the central &#946;&#8208;barrel BamA and four other lipoproteins mediates the folding of the majority of the outer membrane proteins. BamA is placed in an asymmetric bilayer and its lateral gate is suggested to be the functional hotspot. Here we used in situ pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy to characterize BamA in the native outer membrane. In the detergent micelles, the data is consistent with mainly an inward&#8208;open conformation of BamA. The native membrane considerably enhanced the conformational heterogeneity. The lateral gate and the extracellular loop 3 exist in an equilibrium between different conformations. The outer membrane provides a favorable environment for occupying multiple conformational states independent of the lipoproteins. Our results reveal a highly dynamic behavior of the lateral gate and other key structural elements and provide direct evidence for the conformational modulation of a membrane protein in situ.

         <title>syn/anti&#8208;Oligothienoacene Diimides with up to 10 Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and direct synthetic strategy that features a combination of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration for the synthesis of syn/anti&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, is present. The resulting oligomers show significant potential for organic electronic devices with the electron mobility up to 4.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report a facile and powerful strategy to prepare libraries of oligothienoacene diimides that include anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers using palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and an unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration. Through this strategy, a series of oligothienoacene diimides containing 6, 8, and 10 fused rings were synthesized. The molecular geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation have dramatic effects on the electronic properties, degree of crystallinity, and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Notably, single&#8208;crystal microfibers of syn&#8208;3&#8201;c show electron mobilities up to 4.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, illustrating the significant potential of these materials for organic electronic devices. Our work demonstrates the versatility of this strategy for the development of oligothienoacene diimide libraries, in particular complex and large syn&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, which are difficult to prepare by present methods.

         <title>A reconstructed Cu2P2O7 catalyst for selective CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) over Cu&#8208;based catalysts shows a great prospect with converting CO  2  into multicarbon (C  2+  ) fuels and chemicals. Herein, we introduce an A  2  M  2  O  7  structure into Cu&#8208;based catalyst through a solid&#8208;state reaction synthesis method.  The Cu  2  P  2  O  7  catalyst is electrochemically reduced to metallic Cu with a significant structure evolution from grain aggregates to highly porous structure under CO  2  RR conditions. The reconstructed Cu  2  P  2  O  7  catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 73.6% for C  2+  products at an applied current density of 350 mA cm  &#8208;2  , remarkably higher than the CuO counterparts. The reconstructed Cu  2  P  2  O  7  catalyst has high electrochemically active surface area and abundant defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites.  In situ  Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation reveal that CO adsorption with bridge and atop configurations is largely improved on Cu with defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites, which decreased the energy barrier of C&#8208;C coupling reaction for C  2+  products.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Photonic Microspheres with Bridged Lamellar Structures via Droplet&#8208;Confined Block Copolymer Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial self&#8208;assembly systems typically exhibit limited capability in creating nature&#8208;inspired complex materials with advanced functionalities. Here, an effective co&#8208;assembly strategy is demonstrated for the facile creation of complex photonic structures with intriguing light reflections. Two different lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs) are placed within shrinking droplets to enable a cooperative working mechanism of microphase segregation and organized spontaneous emulsification, respectively. Layer assemblies of the lipophilic BCP and uniform water nanodroplets stabilized by the bottlebrush surfactant are both generated, and co&#8208;assembled into a bridged lamellar structure with the alternating arrangement of layers and closely packed nanodroplet arrays. Janus microspheres with diverse dual optical characteristics are successfully fabricated, and reflected wavelengths of light are highly tunable simply by changing formulation or molecular weight of BCP.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multivariate&#8208;Gated DNA Nanodevice for Spatioselective Imaging of Pro&#8208;metastatic Targets in Extracellular Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multivariate&#8208;gated DNA nanodevice was engineered for spatially selective, corelated imaging of ATP and MMP2/9 in extracellular tumor microenviroment. The simultaneous visualization of the dual pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers may allow to discriminate tumors with high risk of metastasis.







Abstract
Probing pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers is of significant importance to evaluate the risk of tumor metastasis, but spatially selective imaging of such targets in extracellular microenvironment is particularly challenging. By introducing the bilinguality of PNA/peptide hybrid that can speak both peptide substrate and nucleobase&#8208;pairing languages to combine with aptamer technology, we designed a smart DNA nanodevice programmed to respond sequentially to dual pro&#8208;metastatic targets, MMP2/9 and ATP, in extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME). The DNA nanodevice is established based on the combination of an ATP&#8208;responsive aptamer sensor and a MMP2/9&#8208;hydrolyzable PNA/peptide copolymer with a cell membrane&#8208;anchoring aptamer module. Taking 4T1 xenograft as a highly aggressive tumor model, the robustness of the DNA nanodevice in spatioselective imaging of MMP2/9 and ATP in TME is demonstrated. We envision that this design will enable the simultaneous visualization of multiple pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers, which allows to gain insights into their pathological roles in tumor metastasis.

         <title>Fully Condensed Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals: Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Structural Defects for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully condensed poly (triazine imide) crystal, which features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and deficient structural defects, decorated with Pt and CoOx as redox cocatalysts efficiently drives the one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting for H2 and O2 production with a record apparent quantum efficiency of 12&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Conventional polymerization for the synthesis of carbon nitride usually generates amorphous heptazine&#8208;based melon with an abundance of undesired structural defects, which function as charge carrier recombination centers to decrease the photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a fully condensed poly (triazine imide) crystal with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and deficient structure defects was obtained by conducting the polycondensation in a mild molten salt of LiCl/NaCl. The melting point of the binary LiCl/NaCl system is around 550&#8201;&#176;C, which substantially restrain the depolymerization of triazine units and extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The optimized polymeric carbon nitride crystal exhibits a high apparent quantum efficiency of 12&#8201;% (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) for hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting, owing to the efficient exciton dissociation and the subsequent fast transfer of charge carriers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiblock core&#8211;shell MOFs heterojunctions were prepared through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits both persistent luminescence and photochromic properties. The bright yellow afterglow in MOFs shell can be detected before irradiation but almost disappears after coloration upon continuous UV irradiation.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;controllable persistent luminescence at the single crystal level can be achieved by the integration of long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and photochromism within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for the first time. Moreover, the multiblock core&#8211;shell heterojunctions have been prepared utilizing the isostructural MOFs through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits bright yellow afterglow emission that gradually disappears upon further irradiation, but the core does not show such property. Benefitting from combined persistent luminescence and photochromic behavior, a multiple encryption demo can be facilely designed based on the dynamic manipulating RTP via reversible photochromism. This work not only develops new types of dynamically photo&#8208;controllable afterglow switch, but also provides a method to obtain MOFs&#8208;based optical heterojunctions towards potential space/time&#8208;resolved information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>From Esters to Ketones via a Photoredox&#8208;Assisted Reductive Acyl Cross&#8208;Coupling Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling reaction of two different carboxylic acid esters was developed for ketone synthesis. The reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions using Hantzsch ester (HE) as an organic reductant, with high chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility. A large range of aryl and 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;acyl electrophiles, and 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl radical precursors were tolerated.







Abstract
A method was developed for ketone synthesis via a photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling (PARAC) using a nickel/photoredox dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two different carboxylic acid esters. A variety of aryl, 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl 2&#8208;pyridyl esters can act as acyl electrophiles while N&#8208;(acyloxy)phthalimides (NHPI esters) act as 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;radical precursors. Our PARAC strategy provides an alternative and reliable way to synthesize various sterically congested 3&#176;&#8208;3&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;2&#176;, and aryl&#8208;3&#176; ketones under mild and highly unified conditions, which have been otherwise difficult to access. The combined experimental and computational studies identified a Ni0/NiI/NiIII pathway for ketone formation.

         <title>A Selective and General Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminomethylation of Olefins to Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective synthesis of amines via hydroaminomethylation of olefins in the presence of the specific Co&#8208;tert&#8208;BuPy&#8208;Xantphos catalyst is presented. This novel system is complementary to previously known noble metal catalysts and constitutes one of the most general catalysts for HAM.







Abstract
A new cobalt catalyst is presented for the domino hydroformylation&#8208;reductive amination reaction of olefins. The optimal Co&#8208;tert&#8208;BuPy&#8208;Xantphos catalyst shows good to excellent linear&#8208;to&#8208;branched (n/iso) regioselectivity for the reactions of aliphatic alkenes with aromatic amines under mild conditions. This system is far more selective than traditional cobalt(I) catalysts and even better than most known rhodium catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)aromatics with a Trifluoromethyl Source and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new trifluoromethoxylation reaction through the combination of readily available trifluoromethylating reagent and oxygen under electrochemical conditions was developed. The synthetic utility of this new protocol is illustrated by the C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes and biorelevant molecules.







Abstract
Trifluoromethoxylated aromatics (ArOCF3) are valuable structural motifs in the area of drug discovery due to the enhancement of their desired physicochemical properties upon the introduction of the trifluoromethoxy group (CF3O). Although significant progress has been made recently in the introduction of CF3O group into aromatics, current methods either require the use of expensive trifluoromethoxylation reagents or require harsh reaction conditions. We present a conceptually new and operationally simple protocol for the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)aromatics by the combination of the readily available trifluoromethylating reagent and oxygen under electrochemical reaction conditions. This reaction proceeds through the initial generation of CF3 radical followed by conversion to CF3O radical, addition to (hetero)aromatics and rearomatization. The utility of this electrochemical trifluoromethoxylation is illustrated by the direct incorporation of CF3O group into a variety of (hetero)aromatics as well as bio&#8208;relevant molecules.

         <title>Transformation of Crowded Oligoarylene into Perylene&#8208;Cored Chiral Nanographene by Sequential Oxidative Cyclization and 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic innovation to construct sophisticated nanographenes is of fundamental significance for a variety of advanced applications. Herein, we report a distinctive method to prepare  &#960;  &#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with 29 benzenoid rings and two helical breaches from a highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene precursor. Under Scholl&#8217;s condition, the reaction majorly involves the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the  peri  &#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. The resulting chiral nanographenes are configurational stable at 180 &#176;C due to the high diastereomerization barriers of ca. 45 kcal mol  &#8722;1  . These molecules also possess globally delocalized  &#960;  &#8208;systems with low HOMO/LUMO gaps, leading to nearly panchromatic absorption, intensive electronic circular dichroism signals and deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Expanding Ion&#8208;Transport Channels on Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish lithium&#8208;ion transport kinetics in anode materials triggers a huge voltage polarization and serious lithium metal plating, greatly restricting the cycling life and energy density of the fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Here we propose a new idea of self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode and realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The self&#8208;expanded lithium&#8208;ion transport channels can be enabled by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with lithium ions during cycling, reduce the energy barrier of lithium&#8208;ion transport and allow a fast lithium&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion, whereby the severe voltage polarization and lithium metal plating are effectively eliminated. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds on the surface of graphdiyne successfully verifies the self&#8208;expanded lithium&#8208;ion transport channels, self&#8208;accelerated lithium in&#8208;plane/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration, and superior fast&#8208;charging capability with a high capacity (342 mA h g  &#8208;1  ) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan (22,000 cycles) under extremely fast&#8208;charging conditions (6 C rate, 1 C = 744 mA g  &#8208;1  ), even at low temperatures (&#8208;10 &#176;C). These results represent a platform for designing novel fast&#8208;charging anode materials with self&#8208;regulatable ion transport channels and significantly enhanced ion solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics.</dc:description>

The self-expanded lithium-ion transport channels can be enabled by a self-reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with lithium ions during cycling, reduce the energy barrier of lithium-ion transport and allow a fast lithium-ion solid-state diffusion, whereby the severe voltage polarization and lithium metal plating are effectively eliminated. Our proof-of-concept demonstration of the self-reversible conversion of chemical bonds on the surface of graphdiyne successfully verifies the self-expanded lithium-ion transport channels, self-accelerated lithium in-plane/out-of-plane migration, and superior fast-charging capability with a high capacity (342 mA h g  -1  ) and an ultra-long lifespan (22,000 cycles) under extremely fast-charging conditions (6 C rate, 1 C = 744 mA g  -1  ), even at low temperatures (-10 &#176;C). These results represent a platform for designing novel fast-charging anode materials with self-regulatable ion transport channels and significantly enhanced ion solid-state diffusion kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitridic Analogs of Micas AESi3P4N10(NH)2 (AE = Mg, Mg0.94Ca0.06, Ca, Sr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the first nitridic analogs of micas, namely  AE  Si  3  P  4  N  10  (NH)  2  (  AE  = Mg, Mg  0.94  Ca  0.06  , Ca, Sr), which were synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400 &#176;C and 8 GPa from the refractory nitrides P  3  N  5  and Si  3  N  4  , the respective alkaline earth amides, implementing NH  4  F as a mineralizer. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping with atomic resolution, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and solid&#8208;state NMR. The structures consist of typical tetrahedra&#8208;octahedra&#8208;tetrahedra (  T  &#8208;  O  &#8208;  T  ) layers with P occupying  T  and Si occupying  O  layers, realizing the rare motif of sixfold coordinated silicon atoms in nitrides. The presence of H, as an imide group forming the SiN  4  (NH)  2  octahedra, is confirmed by SCXRD, MAS&#8208;NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Eu  2+  doped samples show tunable narrow&#8208;band emission from deep blue to cyan (451 &#8211; 492 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>PDMS with Tunable Side Group Mobility and its Highly Permeable  Membrane for  Removal of Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the benchmarked organophilic membrane remain challenges for removal of aromatic compounds due to the undesirable transport channels. In this work, we propose to reconstruct the PDMS conformation with tunable side group mobility by introducing phenyl as rigid molecular spacer to relieve steric hindrance of large&#8208;sized aromatic molecules; meanwhile, polymer segments are loosely stacked to provide additional degrees of freedom as increasing the permeant size. Moreover, the reconstructed PDMS is engineered into composite membrane with preventing aromatic compounds condensation in the substrate pores. The resulting thin&#8208;film composite membrane achieved one order of magnitude higher flux (11.8 kg/m  2  h) with equivalent separation factor (12.3) compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;arts membranes for aromatic removal. The permeant&#8208;customized membrane molecular and microstructure designing strategy opens a new avenue to develop membranes for specific separation target.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Dependent Isomer Convergence of a Permanently Fluxional Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluxional bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, based on the archetypal shape&#8208;shifting molecule bullvalene, self&#8208;assembles with M2+ (M = Pd2+ or Pt2+) to produce a highly complex ensemble of permanently fluxional coordination cages. Metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly selects for an M2L4 architecture while maintaining shape&#8208;shifting ligand complexity. A second level of simplification is achieved with guest&#8208;exchange; the binding of halides within the M2L4 cage mixture results in a convergence to a cage species with all four ligands present as the &#8220;B isomer&#8221;. Within this confine, the reaction graph of the bullvalene is greatly restricted, but gives rise to a mixture of 38 possible diastereoisomers in rapid exchange. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a preference for an achiral form consisting of both ligand enantiomers. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we elucidate the restricted isomerisation pathway of the permanently fluxional M2L4 assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ni(0) &#963;&#8208;Borane Complex of a Rigid Bidentate Borane/Phosphine Ligand: Boryl&#8208;Ni Formation by Oxidative Dehydrochloroborylation and Catalytic Activity for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While of interest, synthetically feasible access to boryl ligands and complexes remains limited, meaning such complexes remain underexploited in catalysis. For bidentate boryl ligands, oxidative addition of boranes to low valent Ir(I) or Pt(0) are the only examples yet reported. As part of our interest in developing improved group 10 ethylene polymerization catalysts, we present here an optimized synthesis of a novel, rigid borane/phosphine ligand and its Ni(0) &#963;&#8208;borane complex. From the latter, an unprecedented oxidative dehydrochloroborylation, to give a Ni(II) boryl complex, was achieved. Furthermore, this new B/P ligand allowed the nickel catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, which suggests that Ni(0) s&#8208;hydroborane complexes act as masked Ni(II) boryl hydride reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Magnesium Vanadates as Potential Mg&#8208;ion Cathode Materials Through an Ab Initio Guided Carbothermal Reduction Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many technologically relevant transition metal oxides for advanced energy storage and catalysis feature reduced transition metal (TM) oxides and are often nontrivial to prepare because of the need to control the reducing nature of the atmosphere in which they are synthesized. In this work, we show that an  ab initio  predictive synthesis strategy can be used to produce multiple gram&#8208;scale products of various MgV  x  O  y  &#8208;type phases (&#948;&#8208;MgV  2  O  5  , spinel MgV  2  O  4  , and MgVO  3  ) containing V  3+  or V  4+  relevant for Mg&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Characterization of these phases using  25  Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy illustrates the potential of  25  Mg NMR for studying reversible magnesiation and local charge distributions. Rotor&#8208;Assisted Population Transfer is used as a much needed signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise enhancement technique. The  ab initio  guided synthesis approach is seen as a step forward towards a predictive synthesis strategy for targeting specific complex TM oxides with variable oxidation states of technological importance beyond Mg&#8208;ion (and indeed Li&#8208;ion) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>From Impossible to Possible: Atom Economic Polymerization of Low Strain Five&#8208;Membered Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of propylene carbonate (PC) only affords oligomers with substantial unidentified by&#8208;products, which hinders the efficient utilization of PC. Through detailed studies, for the first time, a careful mechanism involving the in situ release of propylene oxide (PO) from PC decarboxylation is proposed. Further, we report a novel strategy of copolymerization of PC/cyclic anhydrides via in situ capture of the formed intermediates. Results show that PC is successfully transformed into polyesters. Especially for the ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of PC/phthalic anhydride (PA), a variety of advantages are manifold: (&#1110;) slow&#8208;release of PO ensuring a perfectly alternating structure; (ii) quantitative and fast transformation of PC. (iii) visualization of polymerization process by a CO  2  pressure gauge. Of importance, through tandem polymerizations, PC is fully transformed into polyesters and polycarbonates concurrently, thus achieving PC utilization with a high atom economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Elucidation of Cryptic Algaecides in Marine Algal&#8208;Bacterial Symbioses by NMR Spectroscopy and MicroED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial secondary metabolite discovery is often conducted in pure monocultures. In a natural setting, however, where metabolites are constantly exchanged, biosynthetic precursors are likely provided by symbionts or hosts. In the current work, we report eight novel and architecturally unusual secondary metabolites synthesized by the bacterial symbiont  Phaeobacter inhibens  from precursors that, in a native context, would be provided by their algal hosts. Three of these were produced at low titres and their structures were determined  de novo  using the emerging microcrystal electron diffraction method. Some of the new metabolites exhibited potent algaecidal activity suggesting that the bacterial symbiont can convert algal precursors, tryptophan and sinapic acid, into complex cytotoxins. Our results have important implications for the parasitic phase of algal&#8208;bacterial symbiotic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoroethanol as a Unique Additive for the Chemoselective Electrooxidation of Enamines to Access Unsymmetrically Substituted NH&#8208;Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical method for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles is described. The synthetic strategy comprises a challenging heterocoupling between two structurally diverse enamines  via  sequential chemoselective oxidation, addition, and cyclization processes. A series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted enamines were effectively cross&#8208;coupled from an equimolar mixture to synthesize various unsymmetrical pyrrole derivatives up to 84% yield. The desired cross&#8208;coupling was achieved by tuning the oxidation potential of the enamines by utilizing a &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol (TFE). Additionally, extensive computational studies reveal the unique role of TFE in promoting the heterocoupling process by regulating the activation energies of the reaction steps through H&#8208;bonding and C&#8722;H  &#8230;  &#960; interactions. Importantly, the developed electrochemical protocol was found to be equally efficient for the homocoupling of enamines to form symmetric pyrroles up to 92% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent and Selective RIPK1 Inhibitors Targeting Dual&#8208;Pockets for the Treatment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome and Sepsis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sepsis, characterized with high risk of life&#8208;threatening organ dysfunction represents a major cause of health loss and World Health Organization (WHO) has labelled sepsis as the most urgent unmet medical need in 2017. The emerging biological understanding of the role of RIPK1 in sepsis has opened up an exciting opportunity to explore potent and selective RIPK1 inhibitors as an effective therapeutic strategy for SIRS and sepsis therapy. Herein, we synthesized a class of highly potent dual&#8208;mode RIPK1 inhibitors occupying both the allosteric and the ATP binding pockets, exemplified by compound  21  (  ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55  ) which is about 10&#8208;fold more potent than  GSK2982772  , and exhibits excellent kinase selectivity, good oral pharmacokinetics and good therapeutic effects in the LPS&#8208;induced sepsis model, suggesting that compound  ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55  is a highly promising preclinical candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton/Electron&#8208;Donors Enhancing Electrocatalytic Activity of Supported Conjugated Microporous Polymers for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phthalocyanines (MePc) hold great promises in electrochemical reduction of CO2  to value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the catalytic activity of MePc&#8208;containing polymers often suffers from the limited molecular modulation strategy. Herein, we synthesize an ultrathin conjugated microporous polymer sheath around carbon nanotubes by an ionothermal copolymerization of CoPc and H2Pc via the Scholl reaction. Given the H2Pc&#8208;mediated regulation in synthesis, Co(II) metal is well preserved in form of single atoms on the polymer sheath of carbon nanotubes. With synergistic effect of H2Pc moieties as proton/electron donors, the composites can selectively reduce CO2&#160;to CO with a high Faradic efficiency (  max.  97% at &#8208;0.9 V) in broad potential windows, exceptional turnover frequency (97,592 h&#8208;1  at &#8208;0.65 V) and large current density (&gt; 200 mA cm&#8208;2). It is thus desirable to develop a family of heterogeneous polymerized MePc with molecularly regulating electrocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products on a Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Based Cu(0)&#8208;Cu(I) Tandem Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  on polymer&#8208;modified Cu&#8208;based catalyst has shown high multi&#8208;electron reduction (&gt; 2e  &#8211;  ) selectivity, while most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu(0)&#8208;Cu(I) tandem catalyst for producing C  2+  products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C  2+  faradaic efficiency (FE  C2+  ) of 76.1% with a high partial current density of 304.2 mA cm  &#8211;2  is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu(0)&#8208;PIL&#8208;Cu(I) interfaces are vital for such a reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu(0)&#8208;PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C  2+  selectivity, while Cu(I) species derived PIL&#8208;Cu(I) interfaces exhibit high activity of C&#8211;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Besides, the presence of PIL layer promotes the C  2+  selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8211;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Imaging of Mitochondrial DNA Base Excision Repair Reveals Dynamics of Oxidative Stress Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial function in cells declines with aging and with neurodegeneration, due in large part to accumulated mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that arise from deficient DNA repair. However, measuring this repair activity is challenging. Here we employ a molecular approach for visualizing mitochondrial base excision repair (BER) activity  in situ  by use of a fluorescent probe (  UBER  ) that reacts rapidly with AP sites resulting from BER activity. Administering the probe to cultured cells revealed signals that were localized to mitochondria, enabling selective observation of mtDNA BER intermediates. The probe showed elevated DNA repair activity under oxidative stress, and responded to suppression of glycosylase activity. Furthermore, the probe illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of BER. Absence of MTH1 in cells resulted in elevated demand for BER activity upon extended oxidative stress, while the absence of OGG1 activity limited glycosylation capacity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI) can mediate adverse reactions and hepatotoxicity from drugs, which is a result of their conversion into highly reactive metabolites catalyzed by enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). In the present research, we optimized the key interaction domain of the fluorophore with the target protein&#160;to develop a two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe for&#160;CYP3A enzymes&#160;that are involved in the metabolism of more than half of all clinical drugs. The developed  BN&#8208;1  &#160;probe exhibited appropriate selectivity and sensitivity for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection and imaging of endogenous CYP3A activity in various living systems, thereby providing a high&#8208;throughput screening system enabling evaluation of MBI&#8208;associated hepatotoxicity by CYP3A. Using  BN&#8208;1  &#160;as a fluorescent molecular tool facilitates the efficient discovery and characterization of CYP3A&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Cells: From Simple Bio&#8208;Inspired Modules to Sophisticated Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology is the science of building systems that mimic the structure and function of living cells from scratch. To do this, researchers combine tools from chemistry, materials science and biochemistry to develop functional and structural building blocks to construct synthetic cell&#8208;like systems. The many strategies and materials that have been developed in recent decades have enabled scientists to engineer synthetic cells and organelles that mimic essential functions and behaviors of natural cells. Examples include synthetic cells that can synthesize their own ATP using light, maintain metabolic reactions through enzymatic networks, perform gene replication, and even grow and divide. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the design and construction of synthetic cells and organelles using the bottom&#8208;up approach. Our goal is to present representative synthetic cells of increasing complexity and strategies for solving distinct challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Catalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Arenes: Expeditious Synthesis of the Remdesivir Nucleoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, especially by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stage of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air&#8208;sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, impeding the cost&#8208;efficient supply to patients. We therefore focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective  C  &#8208;glycosylation that initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 after subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Amino Acid Recognition Enables Effective Hydrogen Peroxide Activation at a Manganese Oxidation Catalys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise delivery of a proton plays a key role in O  2  activation at iron oxygenases, enabling the crucial O&#8208;O cleavage step that generates the oxidizing high valent metal&#8208;oxo species. Such proton is delivered by acidic residues that may either directly bind the iron center or lie in its second coordination sphere. Herein, a supramolecular strategy for enzyme&#8208;like H  2  O  2  activation at a biologically inspired manganese catalyst, with nearly stoichiometric amount (1&#8208;1.5 equivalents) of a carboxylic acid is disclosed. Key for this strategy is the incorporation of an &#945;,&#969;&#8208;amino acid in the second coordination sphere of a chiral catalyst via remote ammonium&#8208;crown ether recognition. The properly positioned carboxylic acid function enables effective activation of hydrogen peroxide, leading to catalytic asymmetric epoxidation. Modulation of both amino acid and catalyst structure can tune the efficiency and the enantioselectivity of the reaction, and a study on the oxidative degradation pathway of the system is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bright, Renal&#8208;Clearable NIR&#8208;II Brush Macromolecular Probe with Long Blood Circulation Time for Kidney Disease Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early detection of kidney disease is of vital importance due to their current prevalence worldwide. Fluorescence imaging, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has been regarded as a promising technique for the early diagnosis of kidney disease due to the superior resolution and sensitivity. However, the reported NIR&#8208;II organic renal&#8208;clearable probes are hampered by their low brightness (&#949;  max  &#934;  f&gt;1000 nm  &lt; 10 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) and limited blood circulation time (  t  1/2  &lt; 2 h), which impede the targeted imaging performance. Herein, we develop the aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) brush macromolecular probes (Fudan BDIPY Probes (  FBP 912  )) with high brightness (&#949;  max  &#934;  f&gt;1000 nm  ~ 60 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ), which is about 10&#8208;fold higher than that of previously reported NIR&#8208;II renal&#8208;clearable probes.  FBP 912  exhibits an average diameter of ~ 4 nm and high renal clearance efficiency (~65% excretion through the kidney within 12 h), showing superior performance for non&#8208;invasively diagnosis of renal ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (RIR) earlier than clinical serum&#8208;based protocols. Additionally, the high molecular weight polymer brush enables  FBP 912  with prolonged circulation time (  t  1/2  ~ 6.1 h) and higher brightness than traditional PEGylated renal&#8208;clearable control fluorophores (  t  1/2  &lt; 2 h), facilitating for 4T1 tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and extended retention time.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photoswitching between Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence by Manipulating Excited State Dynamics in Molecular Aggregate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence pathways in organic molecular aggregate remains a challenge due to the complicated singlet&#8208;triplet excited state dynamics process. Herein, we demonstrated a successful example (o&#8208;BFT) to realize photoreversible fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching based on an effective strategy of integrating a phosphor (dibenzofuran) with a photoswitch (dithienylbenzothiophene). o&#8208;BFT exhibited dual emission of fluorescence and RTP in both powder and doping polymer film. Notably, the long&#8208;lived RTP of o&#8208;BFT could be repeatedly erased and restored through reversible photocyclization and decyclization under alternate ultraviolet and visible photoirradiation. In&#8208;depth theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that the triplet inactivation was dominated by a photo&#8208;controlled triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from light&#8208;activated o&#8208;BFT to photoisomer c&#8208;BFT. Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence&#8208;RTP switching.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) is showing increasing power in the construction of anionic supramolecular architectures. Herein, by expanding the anion centers from oxoanion (phosphate or sulfate) to organic tris&#8208;carboxylates, an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a highly entangled, double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology have been assembled with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination &#8220;centers&#8221; in constructing novel topologies with increasing complexity and diversity compared to phosphate or sulfate ions on account of the modifiable size and easy functionalization character of these organic anions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of multiple molecules in mitochondria across the whole brain of freely moving animals is the key bottleneck, for understanding the physiological and pathological mechanisms of mitochondria that plays in the brain events. Here we built up a Raman fiber photometry, and created a highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe based on triple&#8208;recognition strategies of chemical reaction, charge transfer, and characteristic fingerprint peaks, for tracking and simultaneous quantitation of mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  , Ca  2+  and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal upon hypoxia. It was found that mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  , Ca  2+  and pH changed from superficial to deep brain regions upon hypoxia. It was discovered that hypoxia&#8208;induced mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  burst was regulated by ASIC1a, leading to mitochondrial Ca  2+  overload and acidification. Furthermore, we found the overload of mitochondrial Ca  2+  was almost attributed to the influx of extracellular Ca  2+  .</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Copolyester Monomers from Plant&#8208;Based Acrylate and Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PCTA is an important copolyester that has been widely used in our&#160;daily necessities. Currently, its monomers are industrially produced from petroleum&#8208;derived xylene.&#160;To reduce the reliance on fossil energy, we herein disclose an alternative route to access PCTA monomer (terephthalate/isophthalate = 2.4/1) in 61% overall yield&#160;using&#160;plant&#8208;based acrylate and acetaldehyde as the feedstocks. The process includes Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction&#160;of acetaldehyde&#160;with acrylate, subsequent one&#8208;step dehydration/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with acrylate over H2SO4/SiO2&#160;catalyst, and final Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation. Besides, when varying the final step to hydrogenation, another important monomer UNOXOL&#8482; diol&#160;(1,4&#8208;trans/1,4&#8208;cis/1,3&#8208;trans/1,3&#8208;cis&#160;= 5.2/2/2.5/1) can be produced in 67% overall yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear Extension of Anthracene via B&#8592;N &#160;Lewis Pair Formation: Effects on Optoelectronic Properties and Singlet O2 Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation offers an opportunity to judiciously fine&#8208;tune the structural features and optoelectronic properties, to suit the demands of applications in organic electronic devices, bioimaging, and as sensitizers for singlet oxygen. We demonstrate that the N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anthracene offers access to linearly extended acene derivatives Py&#8208;BR (R = Et, Ph, C6F5). In comparison to indeno&#8208;fused 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene, the formal &#8220;BN for CC&#8221; replacement in Py&#8208;BR selectively lowers the LUMO, resulting in a much reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. An even more extended conjugated system with seven six&#8208;membered rings in a row (Qu&#8208;BEt) is obtained by borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)anthracene. Fluorinated Py&#8208;BPf shows particularly advantageous properties, including low&#8208;lying HOMO and LUMO levels, strong yellow&#8208;green fluorescence, and effective singlet oxygen sensitization, while resisting self&#8208;sensitized conversion to its endoperoxide.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite many years of invention, the field of carbohydrate chemistry remains rather inaccessible to non&#8208;specialists, which limits the scientific impact and reach of the discoveries made in the field. Aiming to increase the availability of stereoselective glycosylation chemistry for non&#8208;specialists, we have discovered that several commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective O&#8208;glycosylations of a wide range of phenols and alkyl alcohols. This catalytic reaction utilizes trichloroacetimidates, an easily accessible and synthetically proven electrophile, takes place under air and only initiates when all three reagents are mixed, which should provide better reproducibility by non&#8208;specialists. The reaction exhibits varying degrees of stereospecificity, resulting in &#946;&#8208;selective glycosylations from &#945;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates, whilst an &#945;&#8208;selective glycosylation proceeds from &#946;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates. A mechanistic study revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via an SN2&#8208;like substitution on the protonated electrophile.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductor, hepta(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (HPV), was incorporated into a DNA tensegrity triangle motif using a covalent strategy. 3D arrays were self&#8208;assembled from an HPV&#8208;DNA pseudo&#8208;rhombohedron edge by rational design and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Templated by the DNA motif, HPV molecules exist as single&#8208;molecule fluorescence emitters at the concentration of 8mM within the crystal lattice. The anisotropic fluorescence emission from HPV&#8208;DNA crystals indicates HPV molecules are well aligned in the macroscopic 3D DNA lattices. Sophisticated nanodevices and functional materials constructed from DNA can be developed from this strategy by addressing functional components with molecular accuracy.</dc:description>
