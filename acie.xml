         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Mediated f&#8208;p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling: Achieving Selective Seawater Oxidation and Breaking *OH and *OOH Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we have developed a NiFelDH&#8208;FLPs electrocatalyst based on frustrated Lewis acidic&#8208;basic pairs (FLPs) for seawater oxidation for the first time. Based on the soft hard acid&#8208;base theory, the Lewis acidic sites of FLPs exhibit a strong affinity for OH&#8722;, while the Lewis basic sites demonstrate resistance to Cl&#8722;. Consequently, during the process of seawater electrolysis, the ClOR on the catalyst surface are effectively inhibited due to the existence of FLPs sites.







Abstract
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis plays a crucial role in producing renewable hydrogen energy. However, during the seawater electrolysis process, the anode inevitably undergoes chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) due to Cl&#8722; adsorption, making the seawater electrolysis process difficult to sustain. Inspired by the selective permeability of cell membranes, we propose a biomimetic design of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) layers for selective seawater oxidation. Combining experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been demonstrated that cerium dioxide layers with FLPs sites can decompose water molecules, capture hydroxyl anions, and repel chloride ions simultaneously. DFT theoretical analysis indicates that the FLP sites regulate the Ce&#8197;4&#8201;f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Ni&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling, providing additional oxygen non&#8208;bonding (ONB) to stabilize the Ni&#8722;O bond and optimize the adsorption strength of intermediates, thereby breaking the *OH and *OOH scaling relationship. The assembled anion exchange membrane electrolyzers exhibit an efficiency of 95.7&#8201;% at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can stably operate for 250&#8197;hours at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Importing Atomic Rare&#8208;Earth Sites to Activate Lattice Oxygen of Spinel Oxides for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 catalyst was constructed to tune the lattice oxygen redox during OER, with catalytic mechanism elucidated. Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) compared to NiCo2O4. Electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox.







Abstract
Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare&#8208;earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution within NiCo2O4. The developed Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as also verified by pH&#8208;dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis. The 18O&#8208;labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry provides direct evidence that the oxygen released during the OER originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4. We discover that electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O bonding in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER. This work provides a new perspective for designing highly active spinel oxides for OER and offers significant insights into the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;enhanced LOM mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Fucoidan Analogue and Its Inhibitory Activities against Heparanase and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purpose&#8208;designed low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fucoidan analogue exhibited anti&#8208;heparanase activity even in the cell&#8208;based assay. In addition, the analogue inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, the analogue effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) is ubiquitous on cell surfaces and is used as a receptor by many viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, increased activity of the inflammatory enzyme heparanase (HPSE), which hydrolyses HS, in patients with COVID&#8208;19 not only increases the severity of symptoms but also may facilitate the spread of the virus by degrading HS on the cell surface. Therefore, synthetic HPSE blockades, which can bind to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S) and inhibit viral entry, have attracted much attention. This study investigated the development of a new dual&#8208;targeting antiviral agent against HPSE and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S using fucoidan as a structural motif. It was found that all&#8208;sulfated fucoidan derivative 10, which exhibited the highest binding affinity to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S among 13 derivatives, also showed the highest inhibitory activity against HPSE. Based on this, a newly designed and synthesized fucoidan analogue 16, in which the octyl group of 10 was changed to a cholestanyl group, was found to show approximately 3 times higher activity than 10 but did not inhibit factor Xa associated with undesired anticoagulant effects. The binding affinity of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S was significantly increased approximately 400&#8208;fold over that of 10. The binding of 16 to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S inhibited the binding between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and heparin and between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;S and ACE2. Furthermore, 16 effectively inhibited infection by the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Wuhan strain and two Omicron subvariants.

         <title>Improving the Lithography Sensitivity of Atomically Precise Tin&#8208;Oxo Nanoclusters via Heterometal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise modification of tin&#8208;oxo clusters via the heterometal strategy, specifically varying the metal dopants and their coordination geometries, has resulted in SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2, thereby tuning their distinct lithography performance.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;oxo clusters are increasingly recognized as promising materials for nanolithography technology due to their unique properties, yet their structural impacts on lithography performance remain underexplored. This work explores the structural impacts of heterometal strategies on the performance of tin&#8208;oxo clusters in nanolithography, focusing on various metal dopants and their coordination geometries. Specifically, SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2 were synthesized and characterized. These clusters demonstrate excellent solubility, dispersibility, and stability, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;quality films via spin&#8208;coating for lithographic applications. Notably, this work innovatively employs Atomic Force Microscopy&#8208;based Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM&#8208;IR), neutron reflectivity (NR), and X&#8208;ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements to confirm film homogeneity. Upon electron beam lithography (EBL), all four materials achieve 50&#8197;nm line patterns, with SnOC&#8208;1(In) demonstrating the highest lithography sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to indium dopants, which possess superior EUV absorption capabilities and unsaturated coordination environments. Further studies on exposure mechanisms indicated that Sn&#8722;C bond cleavage generates butyl free radicals, promoting network formations that induce solubility&#8208;switching behaviors for lithography. These findings underscore the efficacy of tailored structural design and modulation of cluster materials through heterometal strategies in enhancing lithography performance, offering valuable insights for future material design and applications.

     alt="Improving the Lithography Sensitivity of Atomically Precise Tin-Oxo Nanoclusters via Heterometal Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise modification of tin-oxo clusters via the heterometal strategy, specifically varying the metal dopants and their coordination geometries, has resulted in &lt;b&gt;SnOC-1(In)&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SnOC-1(Al)&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SnOC-1(Fe)&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;SnOC-2&lt;/b&gt;, thereby tuning their distinct lithography performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin-oxo clusters are increasingly recognized as promising materials for nanolithography technology due to their unique properties, yet their structural impacts on lithography performance remain underexplored. This work explores the structural impacts of heterometal strategies on the performance of tin-oxo clusters in nanolithography, focusing on various metal dopants and their coordination geometries. Specifically, &lt;b&gt;SnOC-1(In)&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SnOC-1(Al)&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;SnOC-1(Fe)&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;SnOC-2&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized and characterized. These clusters demonstrate excellent solubility, dispersibility, and stability, facilitating the preparation of high-quality films via spin-coating for lithographic applications. Notably, this work innovatively employs Atomic Force Microscopy-based Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM-IR), neutron reflectivity (NR), and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements to confirm film homogeneity. Upon electron beam lithography (EBL), all four materials achieve 50&#8197;nm line patterns, with &lt;b&gt;SnOC-1(In)&lt;/b&gt; demonstrating the highest lithography sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to indium dopants, which possess superior EUV absorption capabilities and unsaturated coordination environments. Further studies on exposure mechanisms indicated that Sn&#8722;C bond cleavage generates butyl free radicals, promoting network formations that induce solubility-switching behaviors for lithography. These findings underscore the efficacy of tailored structural design and modulation of cluster materials through heterometal strategies in enhancing lithography performance, offering valuable insights for future material design and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) was introduced as an organic anode for proton batteries. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, fast and efficient Grotthuss proton conduction is enabled in the solid&#8208;state with low activation energy (192.7&#8197;meV). When coupling with tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCBQ) cathode, the all&#8208;organic proton battery achieves long stability over 3500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their applications are limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and lower the redox potentials of quinone materials. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7&#8197;meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500&#8197;cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperature.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes of HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; Radicals with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exotic P&#8208;bearing molecules, HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; are prepared as weakly bound complexes with CO in solid N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. The reaction kinetics for the spontaneous isomerization from HPN&#8901; to HNP&#8901; in the temperature range of 3&#8211;10&#8197;K reveals the dominant contribution by hydrogen atom tunneling.







Abstract
Phosphorus mononitride (PN) is a carrier of phosphorus in the interstellar medium. As the simplest derivatives of PN, the radical species HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; have remained elusive. Herein, we report the generation, characterization, and photochemistry of HPN&#8901; and HNP&#8901; in N2&#8208;matrix at 3&#8197;K. Specifically, HPN&#8901; was formed as a weakly bonded complex with CO in the matrix by 254&#8197;nm photolysis of the novel phosphinyl radical HPNCO&#8901;. The &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO complex is extremely unstable, as it undergoes spontaneous isomerization to the lower&#8208;energy isomer &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO through fast quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) with a half&#8208;life of 6.1&#8197;min at 3&#8197;K. Upon further irradiation at 254&#8197;nm, the reverse conversion of &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO to &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO along with dehydrogenation to yield PN was observed. The characterization &#8901;NPH&#8722;CO and &#8901;PNH&#8722;CO with matrix&#8208;isolation IR spectroscopy is supported by D, 15N, and 13C isotope labeling and quantum chemical calculations at the XYGJ&#8208;OS/AVTZ level of theory, and the mechanism by hydrogen atom tunneling is consistent with multidimensional instanton theory calculations.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Driven Modular Precision Chemistry of Graphene Using &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for laser&#8208;induced precise 2D&#8208;functionalization of graphene using multifunctional trivalent iodine compounds is developed, allowing for complex and customized molecular engineering of the graphene surface. The tailor&#8208;made and reversible attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties enables programming the surface properties of graphene, paving the way for advanced nanoelectronics.







Abstract
The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)&#8208;patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine&#8208;centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser&#8208;induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D&#8208;structuring of this 2D&#8208;film. The tailor&#8208;made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Discovery of Low&#8208;Pt High Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning strategy utilizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks is proposed for the rational design of low&#8208;Pt high entropy intermetallic compounds (PtM3 type, where M=transition metal) for the oxygen reduction reaction. The developed Pt(FeCoNiCu)3/C catalyst, featuring small nanoparticle size, exhibits exceptional mass and specific activity, along with significantly enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Advancing the design of cathode catalysts to significantly maximize platinum utilization and augment the longevity has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of fuel cells. Herein, we rationally design a high entropy intermetallic compound (HEIC, Pt(FeCoNiCu)3) for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by an efficient machine learning stategy, where crystal graph convolutional neural networks are employed to expedite the multicomponent design. Based on a dataset generated from first&#8208;principles calculations, the model can achieve a high prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.003 for surface strain and 0.011&#8197;eV atom&#8722;1 for formation energy. In addition, we identify two chemical features (atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) as new descriptors to explore advanced ORR catalysts. The carbon supported Pt(FeCoNiCu)3 catalyst with small particle size is successfully synthesized by a freeze&#8208;drying&#8208;annealing technology, and exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (4.09&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (7.92&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, The catalyst also shows significantly enhanced electrochemical stability which can be ascribed to the sluggish diffussion effect in the HEIC structure. Beyond offering a promising low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell cathode, this work offers a new paradigm to rationally design advanced catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.

         <title>In situ Monitoring of Photocatalysis on Polymeric Carbon Nitride Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes are developed for time&#8208;resolved monitoring of pCN photocatalyzed reaction processes under visible light conditions. This technique allows simultaneous in situ irradiation and monitoring of heterogeneous reactions, which enables the detection of intermediates that are elusive in conventional spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride has attracted significant interest in heterogeneous photocatalysis due to its activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, we report on using carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes for in situ studies of photocatalytic reaction mechanisms. In a first step, we exploited carbon nitride&#8208;coated crimp vials as batch photoreactors for visible photocatalytic fluorinations of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, with moderate to excellent yields and reusability over multiple cycles. Eventually, carbon nitride&#8208;coated NMR tubes were used as a photoreactor by coupling them with optical fiber irradiation directly inside the spectrometer. This enabled us to follow the reaction with in situ NMR spectroscopy identifying reactive intermediates otherwise elusive in conventional analyses. The method provides advantages for the study of photocatalytic mechanisms of complex reactions and substantially reduces the need of comparative tests for depicting reaction intermediates and conversion pathways.

         <title>Thin Zinc Electrodes Stabilized with Organobromine&#8208;Partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH Cluster Ions for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During Zn electroplating, BDOL of the organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ion preferentially adsorbs on the Zn surface and the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex part desolvates into ZnO&#8208;dominated Zn compounds, acting as the outer SEI. Subsequently, the formed ZnO induces the polymerization of the adsorbed BDOL, forming a polyether inner layer. Benefiting from this SEI, a stable high&#8208;DOD Zn plating/stripping on the thin Zn electrode is achieved.







Abstract
The utilization of thin zinc (Zn) anodes with a high depth of discharge is an effective strategy to increase the energy density of aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs), but challenged by the poor reversibility of Zn electrode due to the serious Zn&#8208;consuming side reactions at the Zn||electrolyte interface. Here, we introduce 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (BDOL) and methanol (MeOH) as electrolyte additive into aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. In the as&#8208;formulated electrolyte, BDOL with a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group (&#8722;CH2Br) tends to pair with the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex, leading to the formation of organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ions. During the Zn electrodeposition process, the formed ZnO&#8208;dominated by&#8208;products induce the polymerization of BDOL monomers, which are previously adsorbed on the electrode. As a result, a uniform dual&#8208;layer SEI with ZnO&#8208;dominated outer layer and polyether&#8208;dominated inner layer is built on the surface of Zn electrode. With such an in situ formed dual&#8208;layer SEI, the Zn||Mg0.9Mn3O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O pouch cell using a 10&#8208;um Zn anode (corresponding to a low negative to positive areal capacity ratio of 3.56) successfully operated for 300&#8197;cycles with a high capacity retention of 86&#8201;%, promising a high practical energy density of &gt;120&#8197;Wh/kg (based on the total mass of Zn and Mg0.9Mn3O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O).

         <title>Monofluorinated Phosphate with Unique P&#8722;F Bond for Nonflammable and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel monofluorinated phosphate co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), is developed. Unlike traditional C&#8722;F bond fluorination strategies, the P&#8722;F bond can effectively reduce the charge density on the oxygen atom of the P=O bond and lower the LUMO level of DEFP, achieving a unique balance between safety and electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large&#8208;scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8722;F bond that allows a trade&#8208;off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8722;F bond in DEFP weakens ion&#8208;dipole interactions with Li+ ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame&#8208;retardant properties of the P&#8722;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bifunctional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Synergistically Enhances Radiotherapy and Activates STING for Potent Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), MOF/MSA&#8208;2, leverages high&#8208;Z Hf6 secondary building units for radioenhancement and releases MSA&#8208;2 for sustained STING activation to mediate the regression of colon tumors in mice. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.







Abstract
The activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein by cyclic dinucleotide metabolites plays a critical role in antitumor immunity. However, synthetic STING agonists like 4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;dimethoxybenzo[b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxobutanoic acid (MSA&#8208;2) exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetics and fail to sustain STING activation in tumors for effective antitumor responses. Here, we report the design of MOF/MSA&#8208;2, a bifunctional MSA&#8208;2 conjugated nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Hf6 secondary building units (SBUs) and hexakis(4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene bridging ligands, for potent cancer radio&#8208;immunotherapy. By leveraging the high&#8208;Z properties of the Hf6 SBUs, the MOF enhances the therapeutic effect of X&#8208;ray radiation and elicits potent immune stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 further enhances radiotherapeutic effects of X&#8208;rays by enabling sustained STING activation and promoting the infiltration and activation of immune cells in the tumors. MOF/MSA&#8208;2 plus low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation elicits strong STING activation and potent tumor regression, and when combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, effectively suppresses both primary and distant tumors through systemic immune activation.

This modular scaffold capitalizes on the programmability of DNA assembly for dynamic regulation of diverse miRiaTACs for enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have accelerated drug development; however, some challenges still exist owing to their lack of tumor selectivity and on&#8208;demand protein degradation. Here, we developed a miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform that enables the on&#8208;demand activation and termination of target degradation in a cell type&#8208;specific manner. Using miRNA&#8208;21 as a model, we engineered DNA hairpins labeled with JQ&#8208;1 and pomalidomide and facilitated the modular assembly of DNA&#8208;encoded pre&#8208;PROTACs through a hybridization chain reaction. This configuration promoted the selective polyubiquitination and degradation of BRD4 upon miR&#8208;21 initiation, highlighting significant tumor selectivity and minimal systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the platform incorporates photolabile groups, enabling the precise optical control of pre&#8208;PROTACs during DNA assembly/disassembly, mitigating the risk of excessive protein degradation. Additionally, by introducing a secondary ligand targeting CDK6, these pre&#8208;PROTACs were used as a modular scaffold for the programmable assembly of active miRiaTACs containing two different warheads in exact stoichiometry, enabling orthogonal multitarget degradation. The integration of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy through an upconversion nanosystem further enhanced the efficacy of the platform with potent in vivo anticancer activity. We anticipate that miRiaTAC represents a significant intersection between dynamic DNA nanotechnology and PROTAC, potentially expanding the versatility of PROTAC toolkit for cancer therapy.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Fluorosurfactants for Droplet&#8208;Based in vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of ten non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment bonded to a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment of various hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal interfacial tensions. A perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water microdroplet formulation allowed for in vivo mechanical force measurements and increased sensitivity was observed, expanding the relevance of this microdroplet platform.







Abstract
Fluorocarbon oils are uniquely suited for many biomedical applications due to their inert, bioorthogonal properties. In order to interface fluorocarbon oils with biological systems, non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants are necessary. However, there is a paucity of non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants with low interfacial tension (IFT) to stabilize fluorocarbon phases in aqueous environments (such as oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions). We developed non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment covalently bonded to a flexible perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment that confer low IFTs between a fluorocarbon oil (HFE&#8208;7700) and water. The synthesis of a panel of surfactants spanning a molecular weight range of 0.64&#8211;66&#8197;kDa with various hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal IFTs, ranging from 1.4 to 17.8 mN m&#8722;1. The majority of these custom fluorosurfactants display poor solubility in water, allowing their co&#8208;introduction with fluorocarbon oils and minimal leaching. We applied the PEG5PFPE1 surfactant for mechanical force measurements in zebrafish, enabling exceptional sensitivity.

         <title>Dinitrogen Reduction and Functionalization by a Siloxide Supported Thulium&#8208;Potassium Complex for the Formation of Ammonia or Hydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxide ligands promote dinitrogen (N2) reduction by Tm(II) ions yielding an N22&#8722; bridged complex that can be further reduced to yield a complex showing a rare triply reduced N23&#8722; radical bound by two Tm and three K cations, that facilitate N2 functionalization by electrophiles (H+, Me+) and N&#8722;C bond formation to yield an Me2N22&#8722; complex.







Abstract
The dinitrogen (N2) chemistry of lanthanides remains less developed compared to the d&#8208;block metals and lanthanide&#8208;promoted N2 functionalization chemistry in well&#8208;defined lanthanide complexes remains elusive. Here we report the synthesis and characterization (SQUID, EPR, DFT, X&#8208;Ray) of the siloxide supported heterobimetallic (Tm/K) complexes [{KTm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1) and [K3{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (2). Complex 2 provides a rare example of a metal complex of the triply reduced N23&#8722; radical. The structure of 2 differs from the few previously reported N23&#8722; complexes as it presents two Tm and three K cations binding the N23&#8722; radical, facilitating N2 functionalization. Notably, the K3Tm2&#8208;bound N23&#8722; moiety reacts with excess H+ to form NH4Cl in 18&#8201;% yield, and with MeOTf at room temperature to yield the dimethyl hydrazido complex [K2{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;(CH3)NN(CH3))] (3). Protonolysis of 3 yields MeHN&#8722;NMeH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2HCl in 18&#8201;% yield.

         <title>The Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 100&#8197;years after Staudinger's seminal reports on the reaction of iminophosphoranes with aldehydes, an alternative path, the so&#8208;called &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction&#8221; has been uncovered. We describe the reaction of bulky azides with PMe3 in the presence of aromatic aldehydes to give triazabutadienes (TBDs). This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is a versatile route towards TBDs, tolerating various aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms into conjugated organic molecules is an important strategy to tune their reactivity and physical properties. In this realm triazabutadienes (TBDs) of the general from R2C=N&#8722;N=NR&#8217; are an interesting class of compounds, however, general synthetic protocols for their generation are limited. Based on the serendipitous finding that the sterically encumbered azide Mes*N3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2) reacted with PMe3 in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde to form a TBD, we now report on the &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig&#8221; reaction. This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is shown to be a versatile tool for the synthesis of a variety of TBDs, tolerating a wide range of aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners. The preference for azide&#8208;Wittig, rather than aza&#8208;Wittig reactivity was rationalized using computational methods. This study shows how kinetic control can significantly alter the reaction pathway, thereby switching from an aza&#8208;Wittig to an azide&#8208;Wittig regime.

         <title>Are Hydroxyl Radicals Spontaneously Generated in Unactivated Water Droplets?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous reactions of water in either highly charged nanodrops formed by electrospray ionization, or less highly charged microdroplets formed by a vibrating mesh screen nebulizer were investigated. No evidence for ionized water dimer, nor oxidation products of the radical scavengers caffeine or melatonin was observed over a wide range of droplet size, net charge, and lifetime, indicating that water is stable at the surface of unactivated water droplets.







Abstract
Spontaneous ionization/breakup of water at the surface of aqueous droplets has been reported with evidence ranging from formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, indicated by ions at m/z 36 attributed to OH&#8901;&#8208;H3O+ or (H2O&#8208;OH2)+&#8901; as well as oxidation products of radical scavengers in mass spectra of water droplets formed by pneumatic nebulization. Here, aqueous droplets are formed both by nanoelectrospray, which produces highly charged nanodrops with initial diameters ~100&#8197;nm, and a vibrating mesh nebulizer, which produces 2&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m droplets that are initially less highly charged. The lifetimes of these droplets range from 10s of &#956;s to 560&#8197;ms and the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios span ~100&#8208;fold range. No ions at m/z 36 are detected with pure water, nor are significant oxidation products for the two radical scavengers that were previously reported to be formed in high abundance. These and other results indicate that prior conclusions about spontaneous hydroxyl radical formation in unactivated water droplets are not supported by the evidence and that water appears to be stable at droplet surfaces over a wide range of droplet size, charge and lifetime.

         <title>[19]Starphene: Combined In&#8208;Solution and On&#8208;Surface Synthesis Towards the Largest Starphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a star&#8208;shaped polyarene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches is described. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface chemistry. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Starphenes are structurally appealing three&#8208;fold symmetric polycyclic aromatic compounds with potential interesting applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This family of star&#8208;shaped polyarenes can be regarded as three acenes that are connected through a single benzene ring. In fact, just like acenes, unsubstituted large starphenes are poorly soluble and highly reactive molecules under ambient conditions making their synthesis difficult to achieve. Herein, we report two different synthetic strategies to obtain a starphene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining solution&#8208;phase and on&#8208;surface synthesis. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9&#8197;eV).

         <title>Photochemically Triggered and Autonomous Oscillatory pH&#8208;Modulated Transient Assembly/Disassembly of DNA Microdroplet Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable or oscillatory pH changes induced by a photoacid or Landolt oscillatory reaction are applied to induce the transient assembly/disassembly of microdroplet protocells. Cyclic and autonomous formation/depletion of the microdroplets following the rhythm of pH changes are demonstrated.







Abstract
The assembly of pH&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;based, phase&#8208;separated microdroplets (MDs) coacervates, consisting of frameworks composed of Y&#8208;shaped nucleic acid modules crosslinked by pH&#8208;responsive strands, is introduced. The phase&#8208;separated MDs reveal dynamic pH&#8208;stimulated switchable or oscillatory transient depletion and reformation. In one system, a photoisomerizable merocyanine/spiropyran photoacid is used for the light&#8208;induced pH switchable modulation of the reaction medium between the values pH=6.0&#8211;4.4. The dynamic transient photochemically&#8208;induced switchable depletion/reformation of phase&#8208;separated MDs, follows the rhythm of pH changes in solution. In a second system, the Landolt oscillatory reaction mixture pH&#8197;7.5&#8594;4.2&#8594;7.5 is applied to stimulate the oscillatory depletion/reformation of the MDs. The autonomous dynamic oscillation of the assembly/disassembly of the MDs follows the oscillating pH rhythm of the reaction medium.

         <title>Germylene Mediated Reductive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Coupling of an Isocyanide and its Device Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive coupling of perimidine based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene and 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide afforded a highly colored and luminescent bis&#8208;spirogerma species with unprecedented simultaneous C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C coupling. The compound is also successfully integrated as a hole transport material in a solar cell.







Abstract
We have demonstrated a unique reductive coupling of 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide, facilitated by a perimidine&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene (NHGe), which yields a bis&#8208;spirogerma compound featuring simultaneous C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation. This reaction, which leads to the oxidation of germanium from +2 to +4, represents a significant departure from previously documented isocyanide&#8208;germylene interactions. The product exhibits extensive conjugation across its bicyclic C4Ge2N2 framework, conferring distinct photophysical properties, including prominent orange luminescence in both solution and solid states. The photophysical properties are supported by the TD&#8208;DFT calculations confirming an n&#8594;&#960;* transition. The potential application of this compound in optoelectronic devices, particularly as a hole transport layer in PbS quantum dot solar cells, is also explored, with promising preliminary results.

Override the intrinsic preference of regioselectivity. An enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones is reported to access alkenyl cyclobutanols. A carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation step is the key to override the intrinsic electronic effect guided regioselectivity. The products are demonstrated to readily advance to enantioenriched three&#8208;dimensional bioisosteres.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of (spiro)cyclobutane derivatives poses significant challenges yet holds promising applications for both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. We report here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones to synthesize alkenyl cyclobutanols with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, delivering a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing rigid (spiro)carbocycle skeletons in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield and 98.5&#8201;:&#8201;1.5 er). The synthetic utility is demonstrated through stereospecific transformations into fused spiro molecules. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is initiated by an active Ni&#8722;H species, with carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation as the key for regioselective control. This catalytic method provides a general solution for regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and represents an efficient reaction pattern for assembling highly strained enantioenriched bioisosteres.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Activatable Copper Nanoplatforms Synergize with the 5&#8208;Azacytidine Prodrug to Potentiate Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of the NIR&#8208;II photosensitizer H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE and the ROS&#8208;responsive copper ionophore DTC&#8208;BA enables targeted activation of cuproptosis in oral carcinoma. Upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation, DTC chelates Cu2+ from H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE to form Cu(DTC)2, which is reduced by endogenous FDX1 to produce Cu+ and promote cuproptosis. The addition of 5&#8208;Azacytidine further replenished cellular FDX1, sustaining cuproptosis and enhancing both tumor suppression and antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T&#8208;cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc&#8208;AzaC) and 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR&#8208;controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image&#8208;guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.

         <title>Unlocking Mechanism of Anion and Cation Interaction on Ion Conduction of Polymer Based Electrolyte in Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing polyesters with different electron withdrawing groups (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to cation is the reason for fast ion conduction of polymer based electrolyte.







Abstract
Polymer based electrolyte shows advantages in compatibly improving safety and interface stability of batteries, while its limited ion conductivity and transfer number make it difficult to apply in batteries with high energy density. Herein, by designing four crosslinking polyesters with different electron withdrawing group (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to Li+ is critical for high Li+ transfer number (

tLi+

 ${t_{Li}^+ }$



) and ionic conductivity of electrolyte. As a result, poly (2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) (PTFM) based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) shows an ionic conductivity of 0.78&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a 

tLi+

 ${{t}_{Li}^{+}}$



 of 0.85, much higher than those of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) without EWG. Moreover, PTFM based GPE shows excellent flame retardancy property. Li||PTFM||NCM811 batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 5.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 show stable cycles of 5&#8197;times to that of Li||PMMA||NCM811. Moreover, the assembled graphite||PTFM||NCM811 pouch cell shows a capacity retention rate of 92&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. This work clarifies the mechanism of cation/anion interaction on ionic conductivity of GPE, which is important to develop high&#8208;performance devices with good safety and flexibility.

         <title>Tunable Isometric Donor&#8208;Acceptor Wurster&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline polymeric materials featuring wide&#8208;ranging structural control and modularity. The synthesis of a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor Wurster building blocks enabled the formation of isostructural, photoactive COFs with distinct optical features in thin films. These COFs were further applied for photoelectrochemical water splitting.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer remarkable versatility, combining ordered structures, high porosity, and tailorable functionalities in nanoscale reaction spaces. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of isostructural, photoactive Wurster&#8208;type COFs achieved by manipulating the chemical and electronic nature of the Wurster aromatic amine building blocks. A series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) Wurster building block molecules was synthesized by incorporating heteroaromatic acceptors with varying strengths between triphenylamine donor groups. These tailored building blocks were integrated into a 2D COF scaffold, resulting in highly crystalline structures and similar morphologies across all COFs. Remarkably, this structural uniformity was also achieved in the synthesis of homogeneous and oriented thin films. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence revealed a tunable red&#8208;shift in film emission exceeding 100&#8197;nm, demonstrating effective manipulation of their optical properties. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies exhibited a doubled current density (8.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;VRHE) for the COF with the strongest acceptor unit. These findings highlight the potential of Wurster D&#8208;A&#8208;D COFs in photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and pave the way for further exploration of chemical functionality&#8208;reactivity&#8208;property relationships in this promising class of photoactive materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembling 19F NMR probe disassembles upon interacting with various nucleotides in physiological conditions, activating the 19F signals and producing unique signatures for each analyte. This technique allows analysis in complex mixtures and facilitates real&#8208;time, in situ monitoring of enzymatic processes for quality control and assessment of inhibitory effects.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of molecular transformations is crucial for advancements in biotechnology. In this study, we introduce a novel self&#8208;assembling 19F&#8208;labeled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe that disassembles upon interaction with various nucleotides. This interaction not only activates the 19F signals but also produces distinct signatures for each specific component, thereby enabling precise identification and quantification of molecules in evolving samples. We demonstrate the capability of this probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and screening potential enzyme inhibitors. These applications highlight the probe's significant potential in enzyme analysis, drug development, and disease diagnostics.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy&#8208;Dense Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through electrolyte design to simultaneously increase the Coulombic efficiency on the graphite anode side and enhance the oxidation stability on the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) Prussian blue analogue cathode side, stable, low&#8208;cost, and energy&#8208;dense PIBs can be realized with specific energy and cycling stability comparable to the contemporary LiFePO4&#8208;based LIBs and superior to emerging SIBs.







Abstract
Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low&#8208;cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low&#8208;voltage anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&gt;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14&#8201;% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94&#8201;%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) high&#8208;voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full&#8208;cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61&#8197;V with a specific energy of 316.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1&#8722;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles.

However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low-voltage anode and high-voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&amp;gt;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14&#8201;% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94&#8201;%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4&#8197;V (&lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K) high-voltage K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full-cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61&#8197;V with a specific energy of 316.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Conditions for Intramolecular N&#8722;O Couplings via Rhodium Nitrenoids Generated from N&#8208;Acyl Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides under rhodium catalysis are presented. The solvent&#8208;free method proceeds via rhodium nitrenoids and produces unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in a short reaction time with up to 98&#8201;% yield. Potential synthetic applications of the resulting five&#8208;membered heterocycles as nitrene precursors are demonstrated by reacting a representative compound with DMSO under heat or blue light.







Abstract
Starting from N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides, mechanochemically generated rhodium nitrenoids undergo intramolecular N&#8722;O couplings to provide unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields. The cyclization proceeds efficiently with a catalyst loading of only 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% in the presence of phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) as oxidant. Neither an inert atmosphere nor additional heating is required in this solvent&#8208;free procedure. Under heat or blue light, the newly formed five&#8208;membered heterocycles function as nitrene precursors reacting with sulfoxides as exemplified by the imidation of dimethyl sulfoxide.

         <title>Switchable Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane as Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing topologically chiral [2]catenane as the chiral platform and switching scaffold, the first stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter with |gPL| reaching up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 was successfully constructed. It further serves as an excellent emitter layer for the fabrication of efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs).







Abstract
Aiming at the fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high dissymmetry factors (gEL) and color purity through the employment of novel chiral source, topologically chiral [2]catenanes were first utilized as the key chiral skeleton to construct novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. Impressively, the efficient chirality induction and unique switchable feature of topologically chiral [2]catenane not only lead to a high |gPL| value up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;2 but also facilitate in situ dynamic switching of the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the resultant topologically chiral emitters exhibit a narrow FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.6&#8201;%, and CPEL with |gEL| of 2.1&#215;10&#8722;3. This study demonstrates the successful construction of the first CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters based on topological chirality with the highest |gPL| among the reported CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters and excellent device performance to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, it endowed the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with distinctive switchable CPL performances, thus providing a novel design strategy as well as a promising platform for developing intelligent CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Oriented Growth of Highly Emissive Manganese Halide Microrods for Dual&#8208;Mode Low&#8208;Loss Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese(II) halide microrod crystals (TPS2MnCl4) are synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Owing to their high PLQY, smooth crystal surface, and negligible self&#8208;absorption, these TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited not only for optical waveguides but can serve as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in a single crystal.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structured lead&#8208;free metal halides have recently attracted widespread attention due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and negligible self&#8208;absorption, showing enormous potential as optical waveguides towards miniaturized photonic devices. However, due to the great difficulty in growth of rod&#8208;like nano/micro&#8208;sized morphologies, such applications have been less explored. Herein, a new&#8208;type emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese (II) halide crystal (TPS2MnCl4, TPS=C18H15S, triphenylsulfonium) in the form of microrods is synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Due to a combination of attractive features such as a high PLQY of 86&#8201;%, negligible self&#8208;absorption and smooth crystal surface, TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited for use in optical waveguide with an ultra&#8208;low optical loss coefficient of 1.20&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1, superior to that of most organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide hybrids, organic materials, polymers and metal nanoclusters to the best of our knowledge. Importantly, TPS2MnCl4 microrods can further work as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in one single crystal. In addition, TPS2MnCl4 microrods also display remarkable performance in lighting and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their distinct optical properties and commendable stability.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Oxidized Tr&#246;ger's Base Macrocyclic Arenes: Unprecedented Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble enantiomeric nitrogen&#8208;oxidized Tr&#246;ger's base macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. These rigid, electron&#8208;deficient cavities exhibit excellent chiral discrimination for a wide range of guests, achieving a record&#8208;breaking enantioselectivity of 41.







Abstract
Achieving high enantioselectivity with synthetic receptors, particularly in water, remains a significant challenge despite the success seen in natural biological systems. In this study, we introduce a facile synthesis of Tr&#246;ger's base (TB)&#8208;containing macrocyclic arenes (TBn), where TB units are linked via methylene bridges, providing the macrocycles with a rigid framework. Oxidation of enantiopure TBn yields corresponding chiral nitrogen oxides (TBnNO) with excellent water solubility, attributed to the high polarity of the N&#8722;O bond, surpassing the pH limitations of traditional ion&#8208;functionalized approaches. Remarkably, TBnNO exhibits exceptional enantioselective recognition toward a wide range of chiral guests in aqueous solution, achieving enantioselectivities as high as 41.0. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of hydrophobic interactions and steric effects caused by rigid chiral cavities. These findings highlight the potential of nitrogen&#8208;oxidized macrocycles as a transformative tool for supramolecular application in water.

         <title>Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters Via a &#8220;Reserve&#8208;Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and tough thermoplastic materials are made available from biodegradable, naturally abundant lactides and lactones through facile polymer synthesis and processing, which features the well&#8208;defined segmented crystallizable chain architecture as the key to their broadly tunable mechanical properties controlled by block periodicity.







Abstract
Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low&#8208;strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi&#8208;crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain&#8208;induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy&#8208;dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape&#8208;memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios. This work and the &#8220;reserve&#8208;release&#8221; crystallization strategy herein highlight the double crystalline multiblock chain architecture as a potential avenue towards reconciling the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off in thermoplastic elastomers and can possibly be extended to other biodegradable building blocks to deliver functional materials with diverse mechanical performances.

         <title>Chiral Polar Bifunctional Polyimide Enantiomers for Asymmetric Photo&#8208; and Piezo&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polar polyimide (PI) enantiomers are developed as novel bifunctional nano&#8208;catalysts for asymmetric photocatalysis and piezocatalysis. The chiral PI catalysts exhibit the chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic H2O2 production, with tunable selectivity between chiral catalysts and circularly polarized light in different bands, and also present remarkable chiral piezocatalytic preference, which achieves asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and chiral tyrosines conversion into dihydroxyphenylalanine and dityrosine under ultrasonic vibration.







Abstract
Chiral catalysts for asymmetric catalysis represent a crucial research focus in chemistry and materials science. However, a few cases about chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalysts primarily focus on plasmonic noble metals. Particularly, developing chiral nano&#8208;catalysts that can be driven by mechanical energy remains in the blank stage. Herein, organic polymer&#8208;based enantiomers, chiral polar polyimide (PI) microspheric nano&#8208;assembly are synthesized as novel bifunctional catalysts for asymmetric photocatalysis and piezocatalysis. The PI catalyst enantiomers present enantioselectivity towards left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, demonstrating chiral&#8208;dependent H2O2 photoproduction. Interestingly, enantioselectivity of the catalyst reverses under irradiation of different bands, presenting tunability in the interaction between chiral catalysts and circularly polarized light. For the first time, enantioselective piezocatalytic behavior is demonstrated by the chiral polar PI catalysts. They show remarkable chiral preference for asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and enantioselective conversion of tyrosine substrates under ultrasonic vibration. The findings provide a new perspective into exploring metal&#8208;free chiral catalysts and their asymmetric catalysis applications across multiple energy forms.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol with O2 over Photoinduced Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich WO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) can be facilely generated and finely confined adjacent to the reductive sites of WO3 via a gentle photoetching approach. Such photoinduced OVs are advantageous for photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with O2, matching well with the charge carrier dynamics to immediately capture the photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites to activate the adsorbed O2.







Abstract
Direct photocatalytic conversion of benzene to phenol with molecular oxygen (O2) is a green alternative to the traditional synthesis. The key is to find an effective photocatalyst to do the trick. Defect engineering of semiconductors with oxygen vacancies (OVs) is an emerging strategy for catalyst fabrication. OVs can trap electrons to promote charge separation and serving as adsorption sites for O2 activation. However, the randomly distribution of OVs on the semiconductor surface often results in mismatching the charge carrier dynamics under irradiation, thus failing to fulfill the unique advantages of OVs for photoredox functions. Herein, we demonstrate that abundant OVs can be facilely generated and precisely located adjacent to the reductive sites on reducible oxide semiconductors such as tungsten oxide (WO3) via a simple photochemistry strategy. Such photoinduced OVs are well suited for photocatalytic benzene oxidation with O2 as they readily capture photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites of WO3 to activate adsorbed O2. The oxygen&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeling experiments further confirm that the OVs also facilitate the integration of oxygen atoms from O2 into phenol, revealing in detail the pathway for photocatalytic benzene hydroxylation. This study demonstrates that the photochemistry approach is an appealing strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance OVs&#8208;rich photocatalysts for solar&#8208;induced chemical conversion.

         <title>Self&#8208;promoted Controlled Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization via Side Chain&#8208;mediated Proton Transfer for the Synthesis of Tertiary Amine&#8208;pendant Polypeptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This is the first report of the direct synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids by self&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant NCAs.







Abstract
Proton transfer is essential in virtually all biochemical processes, with enzymes facilitating this transfer by optimizing the proximity and orientation of reactants through site&#8208;specific hydrogen bonds. Proton transfer is also crucial in the rate&#8208;determining step for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs), widely used to prepare various peptidomimetic materials. This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate the rate of chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This moiety enables hydrogen bond formation between the incoming NCA and the polymer amino growing end. The tertiary amine side chain of the NCA forms a proton shuttle, via a less constrained transition state, to facilitate the proton transfer process. Moreover, the tertiary amine side chains enable the precipitation of NCA monomers through in situ protonation during the monomer synthesis. This greatly facilitates the synthesis of these unreported monomers, allowing the direct controlled synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids. This side chain&#8208;promoted polymerization has rarely been reported. Additionally, the tertiary amine side chains, as widely used functional groups, endow the polymers with unique properties including pH&#8208; and thermo&#8208;responsiveness, tunable pKas, and siRNA transfection capability. The self&#8208;promoted synthesis, facile monomer preparation, and attractive properties make tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids promising materials for various applications.

         <title>Cu&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Catalysts Derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Arrays on Copper Foam for Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterometallic doping strategy was developed to fabricate a bi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derived array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF) for converting nitrogen oxides species coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids into amino acids, which presenting a high selectivity (89&#8201;%) and excellent Faraday efficiency (65.9&#8201;%) towards glycine electrosynthesis due to the synergistic effect between Bi and Cu.







Abstract
Glycine as one of the most abundant amino acids in human proteins, with extensive applications in both life and industry, is conventionally synthesized through complex procedures or toxic feedstocks. In this study, we present a facile and benign electrochemical pathway for synthesis of glycine through reductive coupling of glyoxylic acid and nitrate over a copper&#8208;bismuth bimetal catalyst derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF). Remarkably, Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF achieves a fantastic selectivity of 89&#8201;%, corresponding a high Faraday efficiency of 65.9&#8201;%. From control experiments, the introduction of Bi caused the binding energy of Cu shift to a lower state, which leads to a high selectivity towards the formation of key intermediate hydroxylamine rather than ammonia product, facilitating the formation of oxime and providing additional sites for subsequent hydrogenation reaction on the way to glycine. Moreover, the derivation of MOF arrays ensures the effective dispersion of Bi and enhances the stability of Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF. This innovative approach not only presents sustainable pathways for the production of value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds utilizing readily available carbon and nitrogen sources, but also provides novel insights into the design of multistage structural catalysts for sequential reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Glycine as one of the most abundant amino acids in human proteins, with extensive applications in both life and industry, is conventionally synthesized through complex procedures or toxic feedstocks. In this study, we present a facile and benign electrochemical pathway for synthesis of glycine through reductive coupling of glyoxylic acid and nitrate over a copper-bismuth bimetal catalyst derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF). Remarkably, Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF achieves a fantastic selectivity of 89&#8201;%, corresponding a high Faraday efficiency of 65.9&#8201;%. From control experiments, the introduction of Bi caused the binding energy of Cu shift to a lower state, which leads to a high selectivity towards the formation of key intermediate hydroxylamine rather than ammonia product, facilitating the formation of oxime and providing additional sites for subsequent hydrogenation reaction on the way to glycine. Moreover, the derivation of MOF arrays ensures the effective dispersion of Bi and enhances the stability of Cu/Bi&#8722;C@CF. This innovative approach not only presents sustainable pathways for the production of value-added organonitrogen compounds utilizing readily available carbon and nitrogen sources, but also provides novel insights into the design of multistage structural catalysts for sequential reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Pore Wall Chemistry Empowers Sonodynamic Activity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Heterojunctions for Pro&#8208;Oxidative Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pore wall chemistry modulation approach is proposed for imparting sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions composed of inert bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Among isoreticular counterparts, significant sonodynamic performance is demonstrated only in the heterojunctions with vinyl groups decorated on the pore walls of COFs, which is attributed to the accelerated separation and transfer of charge carriers.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered growing interest in the field of biomedicine; however, their application in sonodynamic therapy remains underexplored due to limited understanding of their intrinsic activity and structure&#8211;property relationships. Here, we present a pore wall chemistry modulation strategy for empowering sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF heterojunctions through in&#8197;situ growth of COFs on bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets (B&#8197;NSs). Compared to the negligible sonodynamic effects observed in the pristine B&#8197;NSs, the 2D heterojunction with vinyl&#8208;decorated COF pore walls demonstrates a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in sonocatalytic singlet oxygen generation. This performance also significantly outperforms that of isoreticular COFs functionalized with methoxy or non&#8208;substituted groups. Mechanistic studies reveal that the vinyl groups in the B@COF (BC) heterojunction facilitate the separation and transfer of charge carriers while also enhancing the adsorption of oxygen molecules. Furthermore, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) loading into the porous COFs boosts the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor nanotherapy via sonocatalytic dual oxidative species generation. These findings underscore the critical role of pore wall chemistry in modulating the sonocatalytic properties of COFs, and advance the development of COF&#8208;based sonosensitizers for pro&#8208;oxidative applications.

         <title>Nucleophilic Fluoride Anion Delivery from Triazacyclononane&#8208;Supported Molecular Ca&#8211;F Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane scaffold is employed for the synthesis of dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes. A bridging Ca&#8208;F&#8722;Ca motif is confirmed crystallographically and nucleophilic fluoride delivery demonstrated in the formation of a range of E&#8722;F bonds. The less nucleophilic anionic O&#8208;donor set reduces the extent of ligand&#8208;centered side reactions compared to related amide&#8208;derived systems.







Abstract
The major source of fluoride, namely calcium difluoride (CaF2), is derived from the mineral fluorspar. Recent advances in the activation of CaF2 via mechanochemical methods have inspired investigation of the fundamental properties of Ca&#8211;F bonds in molecular complexes. However, the paucity of well&#8208;defined molecular Ca&#8211;F&#8208;containing complexes undermines systematic understanding of the factors governing nucleophilic fluoride delivery. Here we report the use of a multidentate bis(phenoxide) ligand based on a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) scaffold for the formation of well&#8208;defined Ca&#8211;F complexes and demonstrate their capabilities in fluoride delivery. Key to this synthesis is a desymmetrization step carried out on the TACN ligand within the Ca coordination sphere. A series of stable anionic dinuclear calcium fluoride complexes has then been accessed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (critically by 19F NMR) and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Nucleophilic fluoride delivery can be used to generate C&#8722;F, Si&#8211;F and S&#8722;F bonds, with a notable advance over amide&#8208;derived ligand scaffolds being the reduced extent of side reactions derived from competing attack on the electrophile by the less nucleophilic O&#8208;donor anionic ligand set.

         <title>Marine Amoebae&#8208;Inspired Salting Hydrogels to Reconfigure Anisotropy for Reprogrammable Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to osmotic pressure, marine amoebae swell in freshwater and deswell in high salinity seawater. Inspired by this, protonation/deprotonation transition was synergized with osmotic pressure to allow polyampholyte hydrogels to swell&#8208;reswell&#8208;deswell upon successive immersion in HCl/NaCl solution and water. Swelling&#8208;reswelling&#8208;deswelling of reconfigurable patterned zones enables reprogrammable shape morphing of hydrogels.







Abstract
Reprogrammable shape morphing is ubiquitous in living beings and highly crucial for them to move in normal situations, even to survive under dangerous conditions. There is increasing interest in using asymmetric hydrogel structures to understand and mimic living beings&#8217; shape morphing upon an external trigger in a controlled way. However, these asymmetric or heterogeneous configurations cannot be further modified once the polymer hydrogels are prepared. Therefore, it is a great challenge to achieve reprogrammable shape morphing using the existing hydrogels. Inspired by marine amoebae, which transform into several different morphologies according to the various external salt concentrations, a new strategy is developed for salting hydrogels to reconfigure their anisotropy toward reprogrammable shape morphing. Polyampholyte hydrogels with equal stoichiometric COO&#8722; and N+(CH3)3 groups were first swollen in HCl/NaCl solution. After being then transferred into water, they first swollen again by water uptake driven by the osmotic pressure, and then were spontaneously deswollen due to increase in internal pH and dialysis of ions leading to deprotonation of COOH to COO&#8722; and regeneration of COO&#8722;/N+(CH3)3 electrostatic attraction. This work provides a novel strategy to reconfigure anisotropy of hydrogel soft actuators and to open up an avenue for reprogrammable shape morphing.

         <dc:description>
A facile design strategy for exploring robust folded luminescent molecules using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole to bridge planar electron donors and acceptors is reported by Zujin Zhao et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202414488). The generated molecules possess a regular sandwich&#8208;structured confirmation like a rigid folded mortise and tenon structure, and display prominent thermally activated delayed fluorescence. They can function efficiently as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Unclicking the Click: A Depolymerizable Clicked Polymer via Two Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major drawback with polymers synthesized via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition is its inability to undergo depolymerization. We addressed this limitation by replacing the triazolyl&#8208;linkage with the isosteric triazolinyl&#8208;linkage via topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) chemistry. The latter underwent denitrogenation to form hydrolyzable imine&#8208;linked polymer. As a proof of concept, we have hydrolyzed the imine&#8208;linked polymer, quantitatively obtaining monomer equivalents. This result enlists triazoline&#8208;linked polymers as depolymerizable polymers.







Abstract
We report here a clicked polymer that can be depolymerized by a declicking reaction. A designed dipeptide monomer, upon heating its crystals, underwent a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition polymerization to form a triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, which upon further heating, underwent a remarkable SCSC denitrogenation, resulting in an imine&#8208;linked polymer quantitatively. As both the TEAC polymerization and the denitrogenation occurred in SCSC fashion, the structures of the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer and the imine&#8208;linked polymer could be determined at atomic resolution by SCXRD. Acid hydrolysis of the imine&#8208;linked polymer leads to quantitative depolymerization, yielding a dipeptide, showcasing the degradability and depolymerizability of such polymers. This solid&#8208;state click polymerization and denitrogenation yielding depolymerizable polymer is attractive over the usual click polymers that cannot be unclicked.

         <title>Energy Dissipation and Toughening of Covalent Networks via a Sacrificial Conformation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the concept of sacrificial conformation, demonstrating that &#946;&#8208;CD act as sacrificial conformation, enabling energy dissipation through force&#8208;induced conformational changes and resulting in a significant enhancement of mechanical performance. Furthermore, we elucidated the microscale force&#8208;responsive nature of &#946;&#8208;CD through CoGEF simulations and investigated their practical role in macroscopic materials using stress relaxation approach on a strain&#8208;controlled rotational rheometer.







Abstract
Covalent polymer networks find wide utility in diverse engineering applications owing to their desirable stiffness and resilience. However, the rigid covalent chemical structure between crosslinking points imposes limitations on enhancing their toughness. Although the incorporation of sacrificial chemical bonds has shown promise in improving toughness through energy dissipation, composite networks struggle to maintain both rapid recovery and stiffness. Consequently, a significant challenge persists in achieving a covalent network that combines high strength, stiffness, toughness, and fast recovery performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sacrificial structure termed &#8220;sacrificial conformation.&#8221; In this approach, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is covalently embedded into the network skeleton as the sacrificial conformation element. Compared to traditional covalent networks (LCN), well&#8208;designed cyclodextrin&#8208;embedded covalent network (CCN) exhibit a 100&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus and a 60&#8208;fold increase in toughness. Importantly, CCN maintains excellent elasticity, ensuring swift recovery after deformation. This sacrificial conformational strategy enables efficient energy dissipation without necessitating the rupture of chemical bonds, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches. This advancement holds great promise for the design and fabrication of advanced elastomers and hydrogels with superior mechanical properties and dynamic behavior.

         <title>A Mechanical Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Stiffens Tumor Cells to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI), composed of synthetic cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids, can overcome the mechanical immune checkpoint by stiffening the tumor cells for enhanced tumor suppression. MICI fuses CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane to deplete the cholesterol from the plasma membrane, thereby improving NK and T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor effects.







Abstract
Tumor progression is associated with tumor&#8208;cell softening. Improving the stiffness of the tumor cells can make them more vulnerable to lymphocyte&#8208;mediated attack. Tumor cell membranes typically exhibit higher cholesterol levels than normal cells, making tumor cells soft. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI) formulated by cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids. Through fusing CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane using a fusogenic liposome formulation, the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is reduced due to the specific host&#8211;guest interactions between CD lipid and cholesterol. As a result, tumor cells are stiffened, and the activation of lymphocytes (including NK and cytotoxic effector T cells) is improved when contacting the stiffened tumor cells, characterized by robust degranulation and effector cytokine production. Notably, this treatment has negligible influence on the infiltration and proliferation of lymphocytes in tumor tissues, confirming that the enhanced antitumor efficacy should result from activating a specific number of lymphocytes caused by direct regulation of the tumor cell stiffness. The combination of MICIs and clinical immunotherapies enhances the lymphocyte&#8208;mediated antitumor effects in two tumor mouse models, including breast cancer and melanoma. Our research also reveals an unappreciated mechanical dimension to lymphocyte activation.

         <title>Suppressing Energy Migration via Antiparallel Spin Alignment in One&#8208;Dimensional Mn2+ Halide Magnets with High Luminescence Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain could effectively suppress the energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, resulting in a low nonradiative transition rate and a high photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Photoexcited energy migration is prone to causing luminescence quenching in Mn2+ luminescent materials, presenting a formidable challenge for optoelectronic applications. Although various strategies and mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the role of spin alignment between adjacent Mn2+ ions has remained largely unexamined. In this study, we have elucidated the influence of spin alignment on energy migration within the one&#8208;dimensional Mn2+&#8208;metal halide compound (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) through variable&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic&#8208;optical spectroscopy. This investigation was conducted with reference to (CH6N3)2MnCl4 (GUA) with isolated [Mn3Cl12]6&#8722; trimers and Cd2+&#8208;doped TMMC. The spin order in TMMC below approximately 55&#8197;K is demonstrated by the disorder&#8208;order transition observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility. This finding is further corroborated by the negligible shift in the temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent emission peaks, a consequence of magnetic saturation. Our results indicate that the antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain in TMMC effectively suppresses energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, thereby reducing nonradiative transitions and enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). This research casts new light on the potential for developing high&#8208;performance Mn2+&#8208;doped phosphors for optoelectronic and spin&#8208;photonic applications, offering insights into the manipulation of spin and energy dynamics in these materials.

         <title>Enhancement of NIR&#8208;II Emission of Er3+ by Doping Fe3+ in Double Perovskites: Multimode Luminescence for Versatile Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe3+,Er3+ co&#8208;doped double perovskite material has been successfully synthesized, showing remarkable characteristics including highly efficient NIR luminescence and multimode controllable luminescence. These findings highlight the immense potential in versatile photoelectric applications including optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and NIR imaging, and provide valuable insights into the modification of luminescent properties by doping transition metal ions.







Abstract
Erbium ions are commonly used to extend the photoelectric properties of metal halide perovskites from visible to near&#8208;infrared range. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency multimode luminescence in a single system is difficult due to the weak absorption associated with forbidden 4f&#8208;4f transitions. In this study, a unique strategy is proposed to adjust multimode luminescence and enhance the second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) emission in Cs2NaBiCl6 by incorporating Fe3+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared material demonstrates reversible thermochromism, driven by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling effect, and exhibits tunable luminescence that can be adjusted by altering excitation energy and temperature. Notably, benefitting from the charge transfer transition of Fe3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; along with the influence of Fe3+ doping on the geometrical and electronic structures, the blue&#8208;excitable (450&#8197;nm) NIR&#8208;II emission around 1541&#8197;nm from Er3+ is realized for the first time, achieving an intensity 16.7&#8197;times higher and a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 22.5&#8201;%. This enhancement enables innovative applications such as two&#8208;dimensional information encryption by the multi&#8208;channel cooperative responses and improved NIR imaging. The study highlights the potential of Fe3+ doping in optimizing absorption and multimode luminescence in perovskites, opening avenues for advanced applications in blue&#8208;excitable NIR light emitting diodes (LEDs), thermometer, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and NIR imaging.

         <title>Ultrafast Tailoring Amorphous Zn0.25V2O5 with Precision&#8208;Engineered Artificial Atomic&#8208;Layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 cathode, with an atomic&#8208;layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 coating, is ultrafast and efficiently synthesized through a colloidal chemical strategy to achieve superior AZIB performance. The amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO and MoS2 artificial interphase synergistically provide more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics while effectively suppressing structural degradation and V&#8208;dissolution during charge&#8211;discharge processes.







Abstract
Vanadium (V)&#8208;based oxides as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) still encounter challenges such as sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and V&#8208;dissolution, thus leading to severe capacity fading and limited life span. Here, we designed an ultrafast and facile colloidal chemical synthesis strategy based on crystalline Zn0.25V2O5 (c&#8208;ZVO) to successfully prepare a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 core@shell heterostructures, where atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 uniformly coats on the surface of amorphous a&#8208;ZVO. The tailored amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO provides more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, thus significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Meanwhile, as an efficient artificial cathode electrolyte interphase, the precision&#8208;engineered atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 with semi&#8208;metallic 1T&#8242; phase not only contributes to improved electron transport but also effectively inhibits the V&#8208;dissolution of a&#8208;ZVO. Therefore, the prepared a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 and conceptually validated a&#8208;V2O5@MoS2 derived from commercial c&#8208;V2O5 exhibit excellent cycling stability at an ultralow current density (0.05&#8197;A g&#8722;1) while maintaining good rate capability and capacity retention. This research achievement provides a new effective strategy for various amorphous cathode designs for AZIBs with superior performance.

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;Ones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Thioamides: Stereodivergent Synthesis of Rocaglaol</title>

         <dc:description>
A direct catalytic asymmetric conjugate reaction between benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides, promoted by a soft Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base cooperative catalysis was developed to access all four stereoisomers of a key intermediate for rocaglaol and its derivatives. Density functional theory calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and ligand&#8208;controlled diastereodivergence.







Abstract
Rocaglaol, a representative flavagline, has attracted significant attention because of its unique chemical structure and biological activities. This paper reports a mild and scalable copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. This method allows for the concise synthesis of all possible stereoisomers of a key intermediate of rocaglaol and its derivatives in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective manner using different chiral phosphine ligands. Theoretical insights into the reaction mechanism and the origin of ligand&#8208;dependent diastereodivergence were obtained using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Catalytically Active Site Mapping Realized through Energy Transfer Modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like a telescope mapping the stars in the sky, resonance energy transfer (RET) offers a window into the world of catalytic &#8220;stars&#8221; nestled within a porous matrix &#8220;sky&#8221;. Integrating catalysts as guests within any porous matrix of a host&#8211;guest catalytic system allows for visualizing active site positions. By mimicking catalysts, fluorescent models pinpoint active sites, while host&#8211;guest systems ensure a &#8242;core&#8211;shell&#8242; distribution, minimizing mass transport effects.







Abstract
The demands of a sustainable chemical industry are a driving force for the development of heterogeneous catalytic platforms exhibiting facile catalyst recovery, recycling, and resilience to diverse reaction conditions. Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst transitions can be realized through the integration of efficient homogeneous catalysts within porous matrices. Herein, we offer a versatile approach to understanding how guest distribution and evolution impact the catalytic performance of heterogeneous host&#8211;guest catalytic platforms by implementing the resonance energy transfer (RET) concept using fluorescent model systems mimicking the steric constraints of targeted catalysts. Using the RET&#8208;based methodology, we mapped condition&#8208;dependent guest (re)distribution within a porous support on the example of modular matrices such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Furthermore, we correlate RET results performed on the model systems with the catalytic performance of two MOF&#8208;encapsulated catalysts used to promote CO2 hydrogenation and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Guests are incorporated using aperture&#8208;opening encapsulation, and catalyst redistribution is not observed under practical reaction conditions, showcasing a pathway to advance catalyst recyclability in the case of host&#8211;guest platforms. These studies represent the first generalizable approach for mapping the guest distribution in heterogeneous host&#8211;guest catalytic systems, providing a foundation for predicting and tailoring the performance of catalysts integrated into various porous supports.

         <dc:description>Dehydrogenative aromatization of alkyl substituents represents a powerful approach to aryl&#8208;substituted functional molecules. However, the inertness of alkyl groups and the need for harsh reaction conditions accompanied by low product selectivity hamper its widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on&#8208;surface thermal aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl&#8208;substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB&#8208;Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI&#8208;Hex), onto a pre&#8208;heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n&#8208;hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C&#8208;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI&#8208;Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n&#8208;hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).</dc:description>

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160 min&#8208;1 to 0.00133 min&#8208;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis suggests that the split force transmission within the ring may suppress the sequential bond rupture mechanism in AM mechanophores under applied forces. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Thermodynamic Self&#8208;Regulation Dynamic Adsorption Mechanism for Ammonia Synthesis through Selective Orbital Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the continuous pursuing on the improvement of catalytic activity, a catalyst performed exceeding catalytic volcano plots is desired, while it is impeded by the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relations of reaction intermediates. Numerous efforts have been focused on optimizing the initial and final intermediates to circumvent the scaling relations for an improved performance. For a step forward, simultaneously optimizing all intermediates is essential to explore the theoretical maximum of catalytic activity. Herein, we proposed a dynamic adsorption mechanism (DAM) to independently regulate the adsorption configurations of all intermediates of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). To demonstrate the DAM, a multi&#8208;site NbNi3 intermetallic is developed, which enables suitable adsorption energies of different intermediates via modulating orbital coupling mechanisms. As a result, NbNi3 achieves an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of NRR of &#8722;0.11 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Strikingly, the theoretical result is confirmed by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, wherein the nanoporous NbNi3 electrode exhibits a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 25.89 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the Faradic efficiency of 33.15% at &#8722;0.25 V vs. RHE. Overall, this work brings out a new strategy to avoid the scaling relations, and opens up a promising avenue toward high&#8208;efficiency NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules through Top Interface Modification with N&#8208;type Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface modification between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in achieving high performance inverted perovskite photovoltaics (i&#8208;PPVs). Herein, non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), known as Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO, were utilized to modify the perovskite/ETL interface in i&#8208;PPVs. Non&#8208;polar solvent&#8208;soluble NFAs can effectively passivate surface defects without structural damage of the underlying perovskite films. Additionally, the improved PCBM ETL induced by NFAs modification significantly accelerates the electrons extraction. As a result, both Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO exhibit more effective interface modification effects compared to traditional PI molecules. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted perovskite solar cell (i&#8208;PSC) modified with Y7&#8208;BO reaches 25.82%. Moreover, the adoption of non&#8208;polar solvents and the superior semiconductor properties of Y7&#8208;BO molecules also enable perovskite solar modules (i&#8208;PSM) with effective areas of 50 cm2, 400 cm2, and 1160 cm2 to achieve record efficiencies of 23.05%, 22.32%, and 21.1% (certified PCE), respectively, making them the best PCE reported in the literature. Importantly, enhanced interface mechanical strength between the perovskite and PCBM layer results in significantly improved environmental and operational stability of the cells. The cells modified with Y7&#8208;BO maintained 94.4% of the initial efficiency after 1522 hours of maximum power point aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycopolymer&#8208;Mediated Selective Separation of Middle Rare Earth Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective separation of rare earth elements (REEs), particularly middle REEs (MREEs) with intermediate ionic radii, poses significant challenges for current methods. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages negatively charged glycopolymers for size&#8208;specific separation of MREEs. By varying glycopolymer properties such as degree of polymerization (DP) and charge density, we achieved a distinct U&#8208;shaped selectivity profile, with a pronounced preference for Samarium (Sm) and Europium (Eu) over other REEs like Cerium (Ce), Gadolinium (Gd), and Holmium (Ho). Enrichment experiments demonstrated the practical potential of this methodology, achieving over 10% selectivity for Sm in Ce/Sm and Ho/Sm mixtures (10:1 ratios). Further, a separation experiment with a 1:1 Ce/Sm mixture yielded 15% enrichment after five filtration cycles with minimal glycopolymer, underscoring the approach's effectiveness. This work highlights the promise of glycopolymer&#8208;based strategies for targeted MREE separation, offering an efficient and tunable pathway for refining separation processes in REE applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Graphene/MoS2 Heterointerfaces by Perpendicular Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface chemistry and interface interactions profoundly influence the properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures. Therefore, developing methods to precisely control surfaces and interfaces is crucial for harnessing the properties and functions of 2D materials and heterostructures. Here, we developed a facile approach to tuning the interface distance and properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (G/MoS2) by varying the functional groups attached to the surface of graphene bottom layer. We systematically investigated how different functionalized graphene bottom layers affect the interlayer distance, coupling between the interlayers, and optical properties of resulting G/MoS2 heterostructures. Our findings indicate that both the size and electron&#8208;withdrawing/donating properties of functional groups are pivotal in regulating charge transport properties, with size playing a particularly decisive role. Our approach demonstrates an efficient and flexible pathway to regulate the interlayer spacing and charge transport, highlighting the potential of engineering interface chemistry in optimizing properties of van der Waals heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Selective Zeolites for Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation&#8208;Carbonylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C&#8208;C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon&#8208;circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small&#8208;pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one&#8208;pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in&#8208;depth for Rh&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Biofuel&#8208;Driven Stepping Chiral Supramolecular Transfer Container</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a biofuel&#8208;driven recyclable chiral supramolecular transfer container based on hexacationic triphenylamine cage and nucleotides. Possessing rotatable paddle rigid backbones, the artificial receptor effectively encapsulated nucleotides with a high binding constant up to 5.37&#215;105 M&#8208;1 in water, displaying guest&#8208;induced efficient fluorescence enhancement with quantum yield increased from 6.5% to 16.6%. Especially, the achiral cage could effectively bind with adenosine triphosphate to activate chirality transfer from substrates to the single molecular container, giving circularly polarized luminescence at 575 nm and positive Cotton effect peaks with significant asymmetric factor (gabs = +6.4&#215;10&#8208;4). Meanwhile, the adaptive chiral supramolecule not only has reversible thermal responsiveness but also could stepwise regulate chirality transfer by the catalysis of hexokinase and apyrase in tandem, showing recovery adaptive chirality after refueled, achieving dynamically regulated programmable multistate chiral luminescent supramolecules. Therefore, the biofuel&#8208;driven chiral supramolecular transfer container could be successfully applied in chiral logic gates and multilevel information encryption, providing new insight into intelligent chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Baddeley Reaction: Access to Functionalized Decalins by Charge&#8208;Promoted Alkane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization of purely aliphatic substrates is a challenging endeavor, as the absence of directing groups generally thwarts attempts at regiocontrol. This is particularly true for difunctionalization reactions, where the control of relative stereochemistry poses an additional obstacle. The Baddeley reaction of decalins, despite suffering from strong limitations with regard to yield and generality, stands as one of only few known transformations capable of regio&#8208; and stereocontrol in aliphatic C&#8211;H functionalization. Herein, we report a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective method for the double functionalization of decalins enabling access to a novel, unreported regioisomer in synthetically useful yields. This method was also successfully applied to a range of other alkane substrates, enabling a straightforward synthesis of keto alcohols from the simplest alkane building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EV)s hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we reveal a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n = 63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by an Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km = 59.31 mM). Thanks to the inherent hepatic passive targeting ability of nanomaterials, the antioxidative nanosheets can accumulate in liver region efficiently after intravenous administration (35.5% ID/g accumulation efficiency), enabling efficient catalytic antioxidation in the liver to mitigate hepatic oxidative stress, protect hepatocytes from apoptosis/ferroptosis. This study provides a new methodology of nanocatalytic antioxidation for treating ALI and other hepatic diseases related to oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Rebuilding Peripheral F, Cl, Br Footprints on Acceptors Enables Binary Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency Exceeding 19.7%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given homomorphic fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms are featured with gradually enlarged polarizability/atomic radius but decreased electronegativity, the rational screen of halogen species and location on small molecular acceptors (SMAs) is quite essential for acquiring desirable molecular packing to boost efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three isomeric SMAs (CH&#8208;F, CH&#8208;C and CH&#8208;B) are constructed by delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints on both central and end units. Such a re&#8208;permutation of peripheral halogens could not only maintain the structural symmetry of SMAs to the maximum, but also acquire extra asymmetric benefits of enhanced dipole moment and intramolecular charge transfer, etc. Moreover, central brominating enhances molecular crystallinity of CH&#8208;B without introducing undesirable steric hindrance on end groups, thus rendering a better balance between high crystallization and domain size control in PM6:CH&#8208;B blend. Further benefitting from the large dielectric constant, small exciton binding energy, optimized molecular packing and great electron transfer integral, CH&#8208;B affords the first class binary OSC efficiency of 19.78%, moreover, the highest efficiency of 18.35% thus far when increasing active layer thickness to ~300 nm. Our successful screening in rebuilding peripheral halogen footprints provides the valuable insight into further rational design of SMAs for record&#8208;breaking OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Squareimines for Molecular Sieving of Aromatic over Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of more energy&#8208;efficient separation technologies is essential. Especially the separation of cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons from their aromatic counterparts remains a significant challenge due to azeotrope formation and similar physical properties, often requiring energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we introduce a novel class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure to optimise &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions within the pore, enabling the highly selective molecular sieving of aromatic compounds from mixtures. Utilising dynamic covalent imine chemistry, the squareimine NDI2F42&#8208;based crystalline functional material is directly obtained from the reaction mixture in a single self&#8208;assembly step in high yields of 84%, alongside the larger NDI2F82 congener, which can be obtained in 69% yield. In vapour sorption and diffusion experiments, NDI2F42 demonstrates rapid adsorption kinetics with selectivities of 97:3 for benzene over cyclohexane and 93:7 for toluene over methylcyclohexane, while single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirm that the selectivity is primarily governed by directed &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of Ambient and High&#8208;Temperature Beryllium Nitride Motifs in W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds of transition metals and beryllium have a wide range of applications, from everyday tools to high tech applications. Remarkably, no single ternary beryllium nitride with a transition metal is known. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates, namely W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9. Both compounds were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from Be3N2 and W, using azide generated N2 as an oxidizing agent. The crystal structures, consisting of alternating layers of WN6 trigonal prisms and BeN4 tetrahedra, were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). The separating nitridoberyllate layers show either ambient temperature (&#945;&#8208;Be3N2 type) or high temperature (&#946;&#8208;Be3N2 type) motifs. W2Be4N5 was further corroborated by infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV&#8208;VIS spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements. The latter revealed a mixed valence with an intermediate oxidation state of 3.5 for the W atoms. Both, the synthesis of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates and the synthesis approach using elemental W pave the way to a new field of nitride chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Myxoquaterines represent a recently discovered class of natural products with intriguing biological properties. They were isolated from Pendulasporacea albinea MSr 11954 and display a unique structure combining heterocyclic (pyrrole, oxazoline), hexa&#173;ene, and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol subunits. We have now synthesized the first example of a myxoquaterine natural product, myxoquaterine&#8208;450, in a highly convergent fashion, in which the sensitive hexaene unit was established in the final stages of the synthesis (16 linear steps starting from l&#8208;serine). Comparison of the synthetic material with an authentic sample allowed to establish and confirm the constitution and configuration of the natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Mono&#8208;radical and Triplet Diradicals Based on Allylic Radical&#8208;Embedded All&#8208;benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high&#8208;spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open&#8208;shell all&#8208;benzenoid PHs: benzo[fg]tetracene (1) and dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene (2). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical 2 showing a half&#8208;life of up to 17.2 days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that 1 and 2 predominantly feature Clar&#8217;s aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound 2 was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. This work introduces a new design strategy for stable high&#8208;spin hydrocarbons, paving the way for future developments in high&#8208;spin organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion/Downshifting Circularly Polarized Luminescence over 1200&#8197;nm in a Single Nanoparticle for Optical Anticounterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, has been realized within a single nanoparticle. This approach enables cutting&#8208;edge encryption applications, including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption.







Abstract
Multimodal upconversion and downshifting circularly polarized luminescent materials hold significant potential for optical anticounterfeiting applications due to their exceptional chiroptical properties. However, constructing these materials within a single emitter remains challenging. In this study, a conceptual model of multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is realized within a single nanoparticle. A new type of nanoparticles with multilayer core&#8211;shell architecture is fabricated, capable of delivering upconversion/downshifting luminescence, when excited by a 980&#8197;nm laser. Utilizing a co&#8208;assembly strategy, multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL emission, covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, can be realized at the supramolecular level. These chiroptical properties closely follow the chirality of host matrix and are strongly dependent on the distribution mode of nanoparticles within the matrix films. The multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL behavior enabled cutting&#8208;edge encryption applications including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption.

     alt="Upconversion/Downshifting Circularly Polarized Luminescence over 1200&#8197;nm in a Single Nanoparticle for Optical Anticounterfeiting and Information Encryption"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near-infrared (NIR-II) region, has been realized within a single nanoparticle. This approach enables cutting-edge encryption applications, including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multimodal upconversion and downshifting circularly polarized luminescent materials hold significant potential for optical anticounterfeiting applications due to their exceptional chiroptical properties. However, constructing these materials within a single emitter remains challenging. In this study, a conceptual model of multimodal upconversion/downshifting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is realized within a single nanoparticle. A new type of nanoparticles with multilayer core&#8211;shell architecture is fabricated, capable of delivering upconversion/downshifting luminescence, when excited by a 980&#8197;nm laser. Utilizing a co-assembly strategy, multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL emission, covering a broad emission range from ultraviolet (UV) to the second near-infrared (NIR-II) region, can be realized at the supramolecular level. These chiroptical properties closely follow the chirality of host matrix and are strongly dependent on the distribution mode of nanoparticles within the matrix films. The multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL behavior enabled cutting-edge encryption applications including optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption. This work introduces a novel approach to designing multimodal upconversion/downshifting CPL materials and opens new avenues for the development of chiroptical functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication of Hierarchical Nanostructures Featuring Amplified Asymmetry Through Co&#8208;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer and Chiral Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical colloidal architectures, characterized by distinct asymmetry, were fabricated through the co&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystal block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with amphiphiles containing chiral amino acid linkers. This study elucidates the regulatory pathways for hierarchical assembly via synergistic effects, highlighting how subtle changes in linker structure can effectively fine&#8208;tune transitions in helical and hierarchical morphology.







Abstract
The widespread presence of hierarchical asymmetric structures in nature has sparked considerable interest because of their unique functionalities. These ingenious structures across multiple scales often emerge from the transfer and amplification of asymmetry from chiral molecules under various synergistic effects. However, constructing artificial chiral asymmetric structures, particularly in developing hierarchical multicomponent structures analogous to those formed in nature through synergistic non&#8208;covalent interactions, still presents tremendous challenges. Herein, we propose a co&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate hierarchical chiral mesostructures by combining a liquid crystalline block copolymer (LC&#8208;BCP) with a small molecular amphiphile containing chiral alanine or phenylalanine as a linker. Through a classic solvent&#8208;exchange process, chiral amphiphiles embedded within LC&#8208;BCP finely regulate the LC ordering effect and facilitate transfer and amplification of asymmetry. Consequently, various co&#8208;assembled structures with significant hierarchical chirality features are obtained through synergetic effects. Remarkably, subtle alterations to the side groups of amino acids in the amphiphiles effectively adjust the hierarchical morphology transition. Moreover, the covalent bonding sequence of amino acids in the amphiphiles emerges as a critical factor governing the formation of hierarchical nanofibers and multilayered vesicles exhibiting a superhelical sense.

         <title>Stabilization of High&#8208;Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the dynamic equilibriums of Co2+/3+ states is proposed as a novel strategy to enhance oxygen evolution. P heteroatoms of reduced graphene oxide are applied to link Co2+ acetylacetonate. By increasing the oxidation degrees of P heteroatoms, the Co sites are spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling. The as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibits intrinsically high oxygen evolution activity.







Abstract
Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH&#8722;/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co2+ sites, the as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.

         <title>Ferroelectric Dipoles Tailoring Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Chemistry to Enable Reversible Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) is assembled with reduced graphene oxide, the strong electronegativity on anode surface would stimulate nearby BTO particles, triggering specific polarization switching of their surface dipoles, resulting in a directional and enhanced polarization electric field, during the Li plating. Attributed to electrostatic interactions, the favorable polarization electric field generated on BTO surface could continuously introduce anions into the Helmholtz layer, allowing more targeted anions (TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722;) to degrade and participate in the subsequent construction of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). As expected, the superior SEIs derived from anions are formed.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a decisive role in building reliable Li metal batteries. However, the scarcity of anions in Helmholtz layer (HL) caused by electrostatic repulsion usually leads to the inferior SEI derived from solvents, resulting in dendrites and &#8216;dead&#8217; Li. Therefore, regulating the distribution of anions in electric double layer (EDL) and continuously introducing more anions into HL to tailor anions&#8208;derived SEI is crucial for achieving stable Li plating/stripping. Herein, by jointly utilizing the controlled defects of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the oriented dipoles of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), the rGO&#8208;BTO composite layer sustainedly brings more TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; into anion&#8208;defecient HL, promoting favorable decomposition of anions and guiding the generation of robust and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;transport SEI containing more inorganics LiF and Li3N species. Thus, the resulting Li deposit shows smooth and dense morphologies without dendrites, leading to high average Coulombic efficiency. The Li//Cu@rGO&#8208;BTO (10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 plated Li) cell exhibits an enhanced Li plating/stripping stability (2700&#8197;h) and a higher rate capability. The LiFePO4 full cell (N/P&#8776;6.3) using rGO&#8208;BTO displays an enhanced capacity retention (82.0&#8201;% @ 430 cycles). This work provides a new insight on the construction of robust SEI by regulating the distribution of anions within EDL.

         <dc:description>
An efficient anion exchange membrane (AEM) and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer enable an AEM water electrolysizer (AEMWE) to operate at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.3&#8197;V. The optimized AEMWE demonstrates an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over a benchmark.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology for green hydrogen production. Although the normal current densities of AEMWEs are below 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, operating them at higher current densities represents an efficient, but little&#8208;explored approach to decrease the total cost of hydrogen production. We show here that a benchmark AEMWE has an operational lifetime of only seconds at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By using a more conductive and robust AEM, and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer, we have developed AEMWEs that stably operate at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with extended lifetimes. The optimized AEMWE has an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over the current benchmark. The cell voltage is only 2.3&#8197;V at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, comparable to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices operating at current densities lower than 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrahigh current density AEMWEs.

The cell voltage is only 2.3&#8197;V at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art devices operating at current densities lower than 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrahigh current density AEMWEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Arylation using Alternating Polarity in flow for Compound Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of compound libraries in flow enabled the C&#8722;X arylation of&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds in the presence of diverse amines (including sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid electrode passivation.







Abstract
Etherification and amination of aryl halide scaffolds are commonly used reactions in parallel medicinal chemistry to rapidly scan structure&#8211;activity relationships with abundant building blocks. Electrochemical methods for aryl etherification and amination demonstrate broad functional group tolerance and extended nucleophile scope compared to traditional methods. Nevertheless, there is a need for robust and scale&#8208;transferable workflows for electrochemical compound library synthesis. Herein we describe a platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of C&#8722;X arylation (X=NH, OH) in flow to access compound libraries. A comprehensive Design of Experiment (DoE) study identifies an optimal protocol which generates high yields across&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds, diverse amines (including electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). Reaction sequences are automated on commercially available equipment to generate libraries of anilines and aryl ethers. The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid accumulating electrode passivation. Moreover, it enables reactions to be performed in air, without supporting electrolyte and with high reproducibility over consecutive runs. Our method represents a powerful means to rapidly generate nucleophile independent C&#8722;X arylation compound libraries using flow electrochemistry.

         <title>Heterogeneous Carbonylation of Alcohols on Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Distinct Mo&#8722;Ni Dual Sites Localized at Edge Sulfur Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and weak adsorption and activation of CH3OH and CO were realized on charge&#8208;density&#8208;distinct Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2, boosting the direct gas phase heterogeneous carbonylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Alcohols carbonylation is of great importance in industry but remains a challenge to abandon the usage of the halide additives and noble metals. Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl&#8208;containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield (STY) of 4.74 molacetyl/kgcat./h and a durable stability as long as 100&#8197;h on Ni@MoS2 catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2 exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH3OH to break its C&#8722;O bond and non&#8208;dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8722;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS2 catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n&#8208;propanol and n&#8208;butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Mechanochemical Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks: Cocrystal Precursor Strategy for Confined Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cocrystal precursor template strategy employs confined assembly for the synthesis of 2D&#8208;imine&#8208;COFs using N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons in a mechanochemical one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process. This strategy leverages the directionality of the helical hydrogen bonding network and the protonation transfer of amine monomers to facilitate the ordered stacking and confined assembly necessary for imine COF formation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional imine covalent organic frameworks (2D imine&#8208;COFs) are crystalline porous materials with broad application prospects. Despite the efforts into their design and synthesis, the mechanisms of their formation are still not fully understood. Herein, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step mechanochemical cocrystal precursor synthetic strategy is developed for efficient construction of 2D imine&#8208;COFs. The mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the cocrystal precursors of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT) and p&#8208;toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) sufficiently regulate the crystalline structure of COF. Evidenced by characterizations and theoretical studies, a helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network was constructed by the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons between amino and sulfonic groups in TAPT&#8208;PTSA, demonstrating the role of cocrystals in promoting the organized stacking of interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, layer arrangement, and interlayer spacing, thus facilitating the orderly assembly of COFs. Moreover, the protonation degree of TAPT amines, which tuned nucleophilic directionality, enabled the sequential progression of intra&#8208; and interlayer imine condensation reactions, inhibiting the formation of amorphous polymers. The transformation from cocrystal precursors to COFs was achieved through comprehensive control of hydrogen bond and covalent bond sites. This work significantly advances the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated COF assembly and its mechanochemical method in the design and synthesis of 2D imine&#8208;COFs, further elucidating the mechanistic aspects of their mechanochemical synthesis.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;stage Benzylic Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly site&#8208;selective acridinium/HAT catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions with simple and inexpensive D2O as an isotope source is reported. Unprecedented selective HIE on competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions was achieved with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation, enabling the effective late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives.







Abstract
A highly regioselective visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of benzylic positions in both simple and complex molecules is reported. The process follows a dual catalytic approach using an acridinium photocatalyst in combination with a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, while the use of D2O as an isotope source ensures operational simplicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. High reactivity has been achieved for electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions. Moreover, targeted radical formation enables unprecedented selective HIE on intramolecular competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation. The utility of the reaction was demonstrated on the late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a single electron transfer (SET) mechanism followed by deprotonation to generate the benzylic radical, and revealed the importance of halogenated solvents or additives. Upon a weak complexation of the halogenated species to the substrate, an oxidation potential lowering effect is induced, as well as a stabilization of the radical&#8208;cation species through spin delocalization.

Current NIR&#8208;II probes are limited by either being "always on" or responding to one stimulus, leading to low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and potential false positives. We introduced a dual&#8208;lock&#8208;controlled probe, HN&#8208;PBA, activated by both H2O2 and tumor acidic environment. This dual response ensures bright fluorescence at tumor sites, leading to higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue ratios (T/NT) compared to conventional &#8220;always on&#8221; probes and probes activated only by H2O2. This strategy allows precise tumor identification and removal of primary and metastatic tumors, achieving superior T/NT ratios (24.3/6.4 for orthotopic and lung metastasis, respectively). Our probe also effectively detected lung metastatic foci as small as &#8804; 0.7 mm and showed the capability for accurate lesion localization in clinical breast cancer specimens. This dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy could aid future diagnostic probe design.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting WLED&#8208;Excited High Temperature Long Afterglow by Orthogonally Anchoring Chromophores into 0D Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal anchoring of chromophores into 0D metal&#8208;organic cages to achieve high&#8208;temperature long afterglow emission. The afterglow emission of Cd&#8208;IDB&#8208;IPA reached 600&#8197;s after turning off the 365&#8197;nm UV lamp at 77&#8197;K, and the afterglow emission was still observed after being excited by WLED at 380&#8197;K.







Abstract
Afterglow materials have garnered significant interest due to distinct photophysical characteristics. However, it is still difficult to achieve long afterglow phosphorescence from organic molecules due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and energy dissipation. In addition, most materials reported so far have long afterglow emission only at room or even low temperatures, and mainly use UV light as an excitation source. In this work, we report a strategy to achieve high temperature long afterglow emission through the assembly of isolated 0D metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). In which, both ACQ and phosphorescence quenching effects are effectively mitigated by altering the stacking mode of organic chromophores through orthogonally anchoring into the edges of cubic MOCs. Furthermore, improvement in molecular rigidity, promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling and broadening of the absorption range are achieved through the MOC&#8208;engineering strategy. As a result, we successfully synthesized MOCs that can produce afterglow emission even after excitation by WLEDs at high temperatures (380&#8197;K). Moreover, the MOCs are capable of generating afterglow emissions when excited by mobile phone flashlight at room temperature. Given these features, the potential applications of MOCs in the visual identification of explosives, information encryption and multicolor display are explored.

         <dc:description>
2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interface layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs, passivates the surface defects from both the surfaces, and enhances the interfacial adhesion and mechanical reliability. The resulting PSCs exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41&#8201;% with improved stability.







Abstract
The regulation of interfaces remains a critical and challenging aspect in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interfacial layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs. The two carboxylic acid moieties on HBPDC bind to SnO2 through esterification, while its nitrogen atoms, possessing lone electron pairs, interact with uncoordinated lead (Pb2+) atoms through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This dual functionality enables simultaneous passivation of surface defects on both the SnO2 and buried perovskite layers. In addition, the electron&#8208;deficient nature of HBPDC enhances interfacial energy band alignment and facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO2. Furthermore, the incorporation of HBPDC strengthens the interfacial adhesion, improving mechanical reliability. As a result, the PSCs exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41&#8201;% under standard AM 1.5G conditions, along with remarkable environmental stability.

         <title>A De Novo Auto&#8208;Activated Solar&#8208;Driven Biohybrid System for Hydrogen Production in Methanotrophic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Climate change driving by greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum&#8208;based energy has garnered significant attention. Renewable energy production via a sustainable system that integrates the cell factory and visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysts offers a novel approach for upcycling methane and addressing global energy challenges. Here, an auto&#8208;activated biohybrid system driven by solar energy is developed for converting methane into hydrogen fuel, which incorporated thienoviologen (S&#8208;MV2+) and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria. In this system, S&#8208;MV2+ functioned as photosensitizer and electron mediator, capturing solar energy and supplying electrons for an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed bioprocess. The genetically modified Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 mutant, lacking methanol dehydrogenase but overexpressing hydrogenase, is able to convert methane into methanol that maintains the electron flow cycle by quenching photogenerated holes for both hydrogen biosynthesis and methane oxidation. Finally, the highest H2 production of 272.96 &#181;M from this biohybrid system was achieved with methanol as a sacrificial agent generated by the H2&#8208;producing mutant, resulting in a 140&#8208;fold enhancement. This innovative method showcases the potential of coupling photocatalysis with methanotrophic biocatalysis for sustainable energy production. Additionally, the system introduces a new strategy for self&#8208;regeneration of sacrificial agents, offering a promising avenue for hydrogen production using greenhouse gases in an eco&#8208;friendly manner.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3&#8208; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy&#8208;intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre&#8208;incorporating [V10O28]6&#8208; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can efficiently drive co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8208; and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with &#8208;NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3&#8208; and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2&#8208;framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#160;Spin&#8208;State Modulation of Catalytic Centers by Weak Ligand Field for Promoting Sulfur Redox Reaction in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spin state of transition&#8208;metal compounds in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) significantly impacts the electronic properties and the kinetics of sulfur redox reactions (SRR). However, accurately designing the spin state remains challenging, which is crucial for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship and developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, the CoF2, specifically the Co2+ with 3d7 electrons in a high&#8208;spin state distribution (t2g5eg2), were tailored predictably for the first time through the weak coordination field effect of the F element. Both DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the spin state of Co2+ transitions from low&#8208; to high&#8208;spin configurations and strongly interacts with sulfur species through Co&#8208;S and Li&#8208;F bonds during the SRR process. This interaction weakens the S&#8208;S bond, promoting its facile cleavage from both ends while also facilitating the rapid and uniform nucleation of Li2S2/Li2S, thus resulting in LSBs with a capacity of 447.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 C rates and stable cycling for 1000 cycles, with an acceptable practical capacity of 585 mAh g&#8208;1 at a high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm&#8208;2. This work achieves rational control of the active Co2+ d electron state through the field effect and enriches the application of spin control to accelerate SRR in LSBs.</dc:description>

Both DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the spin state of Co2+ transitions from low- to high-spin configurations and strongly interacts with sulfur species through Co-S and Li-F bonds during the SRR process. This interaction weakens the S-S bond, promoting its facile cleavage from both ends while also facilitating the rapid and uniform nucleation of Li2S2/Li2S, thus resulting in LSBs with a capacity of 447.7 mAh g-1 at 10 C rates and stable cycling for 1000 cycles, with an acceptable practical capacity of 585 mAh g-1 at a high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm-2. This work achieves rational control of the active Co2+ d electron state through the field effect and enriches the application of spin control to accelerate SRR in LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reducing Dead Species by Electrochemically&#8208;Densified Cathode&#8208;Interface&#8208;Reaction Layer towards High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Endurable Zn||I&#8208;Br Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Interhalogen&#8208;involved aqueous Zn||halogen batteries (AZHBs) are latent high&#8208;energy systems for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet usually suffer from poor high&#8208;rate endurability caused by the formation of &#8220;dead species&#8221;. Herein, via an electrochemically&#8208;densified cathode&#8208;interface&#8208;reaction layer (CIRL), Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries involving interhalogen reactions between the I2 cathode and Br&#8208; from the electrolytes are initially achieved with excellent high&#8208;rate endurability. Different from that in diluted electrolytes, the CIRL formed in Br&#8208;&#8208;concentrated electrolyte is denser and water&#8208;lean, which enables halogen species conversion with a more rapid charge transfer and lower activation energy. More importantly, the CIRL robustly affords a decent I2 conservation by accelerated conversion kinetics and limited species diffusion, thereby endowing the Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries with an ultralong high&#8208;rate lifespan. The electrochemical mechanism is sufficiently verified by multiple spectral characterizations. Consequently, Zn||I&#8208;Br batteries in Br&#8208;&#8208;concentrated (20 m) electrolytes exhibit an overwhelming rate capability and lifespan to those in Br&#8208;&#8208;diluted (2 m) electrolytes. Typically, when cycled at a large current density of 10 A g&#8208;1, an ultralong lifespan of over 25,000 cycles is achieved with a high retention of 98.3%. This study provides new insight into the CIRL&#8208;dictated active species conservation for high&#8208;rate endurable AZHBs, which could apply to other high&#8208;energy interhalogen batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Electron&#8208;Donation Allocation Design for Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, LiNO3 significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, and its protective effect on lithium metal is limited, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Reactivity of Nitrones with Amino Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled modifications of amino acids are an indispensable tool for advancing fundamental and translational research based on peptides and proteins. Yet, we still lack methods to chemically modify each naturally occurring amino acid sidechain. To help address this gap, we show that N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines expand the scope of bioconjugation methods to chemically modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues with evidence for additional tyrosine labelling in a proteomic context. Conjugation primarily at tryptophan sites can be accessed by selective cleavage of modifications at other sidechains. The N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridine reagents are accessed through photoisomerization of nitrones, which serve as photocaged reagents, thus providing an additional level of control over reactivity. Initial guiding principles for the design of nitrone reagents are developed by exploring the impact of structure on UV&#8208;vis absorption, photoisomerization, and reactivity. We identify a nitrone structure that maximizes photoisomerization efficiency, the aqueous stability of the oxaziridine, the extent of amino acid modification, and the stability of the resulting amino acid conjugates. We then translate nitrone reagents to modify proteins in aqueous conditions. Finally, we use nitrones to profile reactive residues across the proteome of a mammalian cell line and find that they expand the proteome coverage</dc:description>

The &#8208;X functional groups dangling on the MOF linkers could be regarded as location&#8208;specific remote microenvironment to regulate electronic properties of the single Cu atoms. Remarkably, they exhibit significant differences in the catalysis toward the hydroboration of alkynes.

         <title>Confinement effects and manipulation strategies of nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials featuring well&#8208;defined nanoscale channels have demonstrated inherent advantages in the selective transport of gases, liquids, and ions, making them pivotal in applications such as molecular separation, catalysis and energy storage. A crucial challenge lies in the assembly of ordered nanochannel structures and the transformation of such microscopic ordered structures into macroscopic regular distributions to achieve performance improvements. Nanocomposites provide a promising solution by incorporating nanoscale material (e.g., filler) that significantly enhance macroscale properties of matrix (e.g., polymer). In this review, we spotlight nanocomposite membranes that leverage the confinement effects between filler and matrix to construct precise nanochannels and regulate the nanochannel distribution. We discussed the underlying design principles, channel architectures, and the manipulation strategies for integrating filler and polymers into functional membranes. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental mechanisms of mass transport, and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships within the nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation. This work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these nanocomposite membranes can be further developed to meet the demands of industrial and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Coplanarity and Giant Birefringence in Hydroxypyridinium Nitrate via Hydrogen Bonding between Planar Donors and Planar Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals, which possess optical anisotropy, are important optical components. However, designing and synthesizing birefringent crystals faces the challenge of achieving anisotropic structures, especially coplanar geometries. Herein, we achieve a significant birefringence in an ionic compound (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8211;, (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium nitrate, 4HPN) by hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors. We demonstrate that the interactions between the planar hydrogen bond donor ((C5H6ON)+) and planar hydrogen bond acceptor ((NO3)&#8211;) ensure the coplanarity during the crystal packing, generating the desired giant optical anisotropy. On two manually cut crystal chips, we observe a &#160;= 0.494 (&#160;= 0.593), which is the largest among nitrates, or hydroxypyridinium derivatives. This &#160;value already surpasses those of the benchmark crystals, e.g., YVO4 and CaCO3, commonly used in the UV to visible and near IR spectral range. 4HPN also exhibits a strong second harmonic generation response (9.55 &#215; KDP). This strategy offers a promising avenue for the design and development of birefringent crystals with potential applications in optical communication, sensing and signal processing devices.</dc:description>

Herein, we achieve a significant birefringence in an ionic compound (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8211;, (4-hydroxypyridinium nitrate, 4HPN) by hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors. We demonstrate that the interactions between the planar hydrogen bond donor ((C5H6ON)+) and planar hydrogen bond acceptor ((NO3)&#8211;) ensure the coplanarity during the crystal packing, generating the desired giant optical anisotropy. On two manually cut crystal chips, we observe a &#160;= 0.494 (&#160;= 0.593), which is the largest among nitrates, or hydroxypyridinium derivatives. This &#160;value already surpasses those of the benchmark crystals, e.g., YVO4 and CaCO3, commonly used in the UV to visible and near IR spectral range. 4HPN also exhibits a strong second harmonic generation response (9.55 &#215; KDP). This strategy offers a promising avenue for the design and development of birefringent crystals with potential applications in optical communication, sensing and signal processing devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthetic Origin of the Methoxy Group in Quinine and Related&#160;Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>a methoxy group that has been assumed to be incorporated at a late pathway stage. Here we show that the methoxy group in quinine and related alkaloids is introduced onto the starting substrate tryptamine. Feeding studies definitively show that 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine is utilized as a quinine biosynthetic intermediate in planta. We discover the biosynthetic genes that encode the responsible oxidase and methyltransferase, and we use these genes to reconstitute the early steps of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce a mixture of methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloid intermediates. Importantly, we show that the co&#8208;occurrence of both tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine substrates, along with the substrate promiscuity of downstream pathway enzymes, enable parallel formation of both methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy towards Michael Addition Reactions of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of Michael addition reactions to conjugated cyclopropenes is a challenge in organic synthesis due to the fleeting and reactive nature of such strained Michael acceptor systems. Herein, the development of a photochemical approach towards such conjugated cyclopropenes is reported that serves as a strategic entry point to densely functionalized cyclopropanes in a diastereoselective fashion. The process involves the light&#8208;mediated generation of transient cyclopropenyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters from vinyl diazo esters, followed by an organic base catalyzed nucleophilic addition of N&#8208;heterocycles to directly access &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic cyclopropanoic esters. With this synergistic approach, various trisubstituted cyclopropanes bearing N&#8208;heteroaryl and N&#8208;heterocyclic rings such as indole, pyrrole, benzimidazole, isatin, pyridinone and quinolinone were accessed efficiently in good yield and decent to good diastereoselectivities. Further, &#946;&#8208;indolyl cyclopropanoic acids have been synthesized and were successfully evaluated as FABP&#8208;4 inhibitors. Theoretical calculations have been performed to elucidate the mechanism which was further supported by experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkynes with CO2: En Route to Axially Chiral Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, E/Z and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculation elucidate the origin of chiral induction and anti&#8208;selectivity in vinyl&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn Node in Metal&#8208;Organic Layers on Carbon Nitride Support for CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect&#8208;induced lattice distortion presents an advantageous approach to tailor the electronic structure and CO2 adsorption properties of catalytic centers, consequently conferring desirable photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, achieving precise J&#8208;T distortion control over catalytic sites to enhance CO2 adsorption/activation and target&#8208;product desorption remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we successfully induced J&#8208;T lattice distortion in neighboring Ni sites by exchanging high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni nodes. EXAFS results and DFT simulations revealed that the highly asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes induced structural contraction (shortened Ni&#8208;O bonds) in the adjacent Ni&#8208;O lattice. The magnetic hysteresis loop (M&#8208;H) confirmed that the introduction of Mn2+ increased the number of spin electrons, thereby increasing the magnetization intensity. The spin mismatch between photogenerated electrons and holes suppressed charge recombination. Significantly, the d orbitals of the Ni sites in the Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes exhibited strong orbital hybridization with the p orbitals of CO2, as evidenced by the enhanced d&#8208;p orbital overlap, facilitating rapid CO2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, the sample featuring lattice&#8208;mismatched Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Mn nodes exhibited an 8.79&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production rate compared to the Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni nodes, in the absence of cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters offer natural advantages for creating power&#8208;efficient, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut OLEDs. However, current green MR&#8208;TADF emitters face challenges in simultaneously achieving high color purity and efficient reverse inter&#8208;system crossing (RISC), leading to suboptimal device performance. In this study, we propose a synergistic molecular design approach that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral locking to address these challenges. This approach allows for the construction of quadruple borylated MR&#8208;TADF emitters that not only deliver precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15 nm, but also exhibit close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield, rapid RISC, and optimal horizontal dipole orientation. The resulting sensitizer&#8208;free OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% at maximum and 31.8% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2. Additionally, the device shows good operational stability, with a lifetime (LT80) of 485 hours at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&#8208;2. This study hence offers a promising molecular design strategy that effectively enhances the comprehensive OLED performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a promising solution for global hydrogen infrastructure, but their practical application faces two key challenges: sluggish dehydrogenation processes and the reliance on catalysts with high noble metal loadings. This study presents a scalable approach to reduce noble metal usage while maintaining high catalytic activity. We synthesized an ultralow Pt content (0.1 wt%) catalyst using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;based pellet support with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that the thin ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell provides a heterogeneous interface, confining electronically rich Pt&#8208;nanoparticle ensembles. The catalyst outperforms both equivalent Pt&#8208;content catalysts and a commercial 0.5 wt% Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst in homocyclic LOHC dehydrogenation. This study provides insights into the beneficial role of ALD&#8208;engineered interfaces for catalytic supports and offers an efficient approach for scalable production of low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;content catalysts, with implications for various catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Redox Probes to Determine Band&#8208;Edge Locations and Dopant Concentrations of Nano&#8208;TiO2 Thin&#8208;Films: Settling the Mott&#8208;Schottky Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowing the exact location of the semiconductor band&#8208;edges is key for mechanistic insights into their use for water and CO2 photo/electrocatalysis. In this regard, a reliable strategy for nano&#8208;semiconductors did not exist yet. We demonstrate the use of reversible redox probes on nano&#8208;semiconductor electrodes to determine their band&#8208;edge locations in aqueous solutions. Rectifying current&#8208;potential (i&#8208;U) characteristics with the high work function Fe(CN)63&#8208;/Fe(CN)64&#8208; redox couple yielded the exact flatband potential at various pH whereas the reversible i&#8208;U characteristics with the low work function Ru(NH3)63+/Ru(NH3)62+ redox couple provided the conduction band&#8208;edge location and dopant concentration for a 30nm thin&#8208;film n&#8208;TiO2. The methodology can be extended to other nano&#8208;semiconductors and serves as an alternative to and goes beyond the capabilities of the Mott&#8208;Schottky procedure for bulk semiconductor electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Interface Dipole Interaction between Ethers and Active Species toward Highly Stable Li&#8208;SPAN Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is recognized as a promising organic cathode for long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries. Nevertheless, the irreversible cleavage/formation of multiple sulfur&#8208;sulfur (S&#8208;S) bonds of SPAN within conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes results in loss of active S species, severe capacity fading and shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a new electrolyte based on dipropyl ether (PE) solvent for Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. Benefiting from the particular chain&#8208;coordination structure and weak dipole interactions with Li+ and active species, the resulting electrolyte not only achieves low desolvation energy barrier and high Li+ transference number, but also displays stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface (EEI). Consequently, the full cells utilizing this electrolyte exhibit good cyclability, outstanding capacity retention and superior extreme&#8208;temperature (&#8208;50&#176;C to 50 &#176;C) performance. Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with lean electrolyte (2.5 g Ah&#8208;1) achieves record cycle stability with 96.5% capacity retention after 75 cycles, which deliver an initial specific energy density of 150 Wh kg&#8208;1 (based on the weight of the entire cell). Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of organic electrodes employing with PE&#8208;based electrolytes. This work highlights the strategy for modulating the dipole interaction at EEI for long&#8208;lifespan Li&#8208;organic batteries at extreme conditions.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a new electrolyte based on dipropyl ether (PE) solvent for Li-SPAN batteries. Benefiting from the particular chain-coordination structure and weak dipole interactions with Li+ and active species, the resulting electrolyte not only achieves low desolvation energy barrier and high Li+ transference number, but also displays stable electrolyte-electrode interface (EEI).

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Driven by Multi&#8208;Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, poor stability and an unfavorable freezing point hinder their actual application. Herein, a ternary salts&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn0.2Na0.4Li0.4(ClO4)1.2&#183;7H2O is proposed to address the above issues. The addition of perchlorate salts with different cations reduces the size of ion clusters, significantly increases the solvation structure species, and promotes the anion&#8208;rich Zn2+ solvation structures, resulting in an enlarged electrochemical stability window, favorable viscosity and ionic conductivity, and low freezing point. Furthermore, characterization and calculations confirm that multiple types of solvation structures effectively increase the electrolyte entropy. As a consequence, the Zn/Zn symmetric cells in HEE can sustainably cycle for at least 1000 hours and 1500 hours under room and subzero temperatures, respectively. The Na0.33V2O5/Zn and polyaniline/Zn full cells can even last for 30000 and 20000 cycles without capacity decay at &#8722;20 &#176;C, respectively. The pouch cells employing HEE deliver promising capacity and stability, even at high mass loading of active materials. This strategy of introducing multiple salts with different cations to construct a high&#8208;entropy environment provides a facile approach for high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs across a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Elastic Single&#8208;Atom Protrusions Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) generation, but the eNRR efficiency is dramatically impeded by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, inspired by the dynamic extension&#8208;contraction of sea anemone tentacles in response to environmental changes, we propose a biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion on vanadium oxide support (pSA Mo/VOH) electrocatalyst featuring a symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo site and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramid for efficient eNRR. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the protruding Mo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking structure optimizes the d electron filling of Mo, enhancing the back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* antibonding orbital, effectively polarizing the N&#8801;N bond and reducing the barrier from *N2 to *N2H. Notably, the elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure of pSA Mo provides a dynamic Mo&#8722;O microenvironment during continuous eNRR processes. This optimizes the electronic structure of the Mo sites based on different reaction intermediates, enhancing the adsorption of various N intermediates and maintaining low barriers throughout the six&#8208;step hydrogenation process. Consequently, the elastic pSA Mo/VOH exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate of 50.71 &#177; 1.12 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 35.38 &#177; 1.03%, outperforming most electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesis of Synergistic Single&#8208;Atom/Nanocluster Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing catalysts that simultaneously containing single atom/metal nanocluster active sites is a promising strategy to enhance the original catalytic behavior and accelerate the catalysis involving multi&#8208;electron reactions or multi&#8208;intermediates. Herein, the pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic method is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The controllable pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy allows the precise modulation of the active centers, realizing the optimization of the adsorption energy and the regulation of the synergistic active components. Specially, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2 of 25 mV and 8.6 mV, respectively, combining with outstanding durability towards high current density and methanol poisoning. This work developed a universal synthetic strategy for the single atom/nanocluster synergy systems and further demonstrated the superiority of heterogeneous components.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Single Atom&#8208;supported Covalent Organic Frameworks for Aqueous&#8208;phase Hydrogenative Hydrogenolysis of Aromatic Aldehydes via Hydrogen Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a method for the tandem hydrogenative hydrogenolysis of bio&#8208;based furfuryl aldehydes to methylfurans is crucial for synthesizing sustainable biofuels and chemicals; however, it poses a challenge due to the easy hydrogenation of the C=C bond and difficult cleavage of the C&#8211;O bond. Herein, a palladium (Pd) single&#8208;atom&#8208;supported covalent organic framework was fabricated and showed a unique 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran yield of up to 98.2% when reacted with 5&#8208;methyl furfuryl aldehyde in an unprecedented water solvent at 30&#176;C. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent catalytic universality while converting various furfuryl&#8208;, benzyl&#8208;, and heterocyclic aldehydes at room temperature. The analysis of the catalytic mechanism confirmed that H2 was heterolytically activated on the Pd&#8211;N pair and triggered the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) host, resulting in H&#8211;&#8211;Pd&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O&#8211;H+ sites. These sites served as novel asymmetric hydrogenation sites for the C=O group and hydrogenolysis sites for the C&#8211;OH group through a scarce SN2 mechanism. This study demonstrated remarkable bifunctional catalysis through the H2&#8208;induced keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of COF catalysts for the atypical preparation of methyl aromatics in a water solvent at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Spring&#8208;Like Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes Experiencing Giant and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion Across Two Distinct Temperature Regimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic molecules with tunable chemical and physical properties in response to external stimuli hold great potential for applications in information storage, smart molecular machines, and biomimetics. Among them, supramolecular springs and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes can both undergo visible macroscopic changes under heat or light stimulation. In this study, we synthesized a trinuclear Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex, [(R&#8208;L)FeII{Au(CN)2}2] (R1), using a chiral chelating ligand decorated with rotatable benzyl rings. The [FeAu2] trinuclear molecules form a 21&#8208;helical supramolecular chain via elastic Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au contacts. Interestingly, the synergy between the multiple dynamic factors (SCO event, rotation of the rings, and flexibility in Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au distance) endows the complex with multiple switchings in both magnetism and structure, as well as the most intriguing characteristic of giant and anisotropic &#8220;breathing&#8221; feature in thermal expansion within two distinct temperature regimes. Specifically, complex R1 undergoes two hysteretic magnetic transitions: a non&#8208;spin transition and an unsymmetric SCO transition. Both transitions are triggered/accompanied by the rotation of the benzyl rings. Correspondingly, reversible spring&#8208;like motions of the helical chains are observed in the two distinct temperature regimes. This work demonstrates a significant success in incorporating both SCO and spring&#8208;like motion in one system, paving the way for designing multifunctional dynamic materials for future devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine: Attractive scaffold for highly selective inhibitors of underexplored protein kinases with variable binding mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases are key regulators of numerous biological processes and aberrant kinase activity can cause various diseases, particularly cancer. Herein, we report the identification of new series of highly selective kinase inhibitors based on the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold. The weak interaction of the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine core with the kinase hinge region allows for profoundly different binding modes all of which maintain high kinome&#8208;wide selectivity, as illustrated by the isomers MU1464 and MU1668. Thus, this core structure provides a template of ATP&#8208;competitive but not ATP&#8208;mimetic inhibitors that are anchored at the kinase back pocket. Mapping the chemical space around the central thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine pharmacophore afforded highly selective inhibitors of the kinase Haspin, exemplified by the compound MU1920 that fulfils criteria for a quality chemical probe and is suitable for use in in vivo applications. However, despite the role of Haspin in mitosis, the inhibition of Haspin alone was not sufficient to elicit cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. The thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold can be used in a broader context, as a basis of inhibitors targeting other underexplored protein kinases, such as CDKLs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a robust strategy for tuning the electronic structure and chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs). By fusing two cyclopentadienyl rings in the peri&#8208;tetracene bay regions, we introduce antiaromatic character into the &#960;&#8208;system, leading to unique photophysical and electronic properties. A stable mesityl&#8208;substituted dicyclopenta&#8208;peri&#8208;tetracene derivative was synthesized through stepwise formylation/intramolecular cyclization at the bay regions of the dihydro peri&#8208;tetracene precursor, followed by oxidative dehydrogenation. This compound features an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, global antiaromaticity, exceptional stability under ambient conditions, and amphoteric redox behavior with a small energy gap. Its dication also possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and its structure was identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, revealing a unique [14]annulene&#8208;within&#8208;[22]annulene global aromatic structure. In contrast, the dianion exhibits a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state. This work provides valuable insights for designing and synthesizing novel open&#8208;shell PHs with tunable electronic structures and remarkable stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Aggregation States of a Pd6L4 Cage for Selectivity Flipping during the Stereo&#8208;Divergent Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic system has been established using a singular palladium&#8208;based octahedral cage as the supramolecular reactor, deftly unlocking off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Water serves as a critical regulator, modulating the catalyst states, reaction rates, and endpoints. The choice of solvent system influences the activity of host&#8208;guest binding and the reaction types of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, effectively modifying the reaction steps involved in the Z&#8594;E isomerization during the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Kinetic and inhibition experiments indicate that the catalyst mimics the binding and activation characteristics of enzymes towards substrates, enabling selective transformations within the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment. The utility of this switchable cage&#8208;confined catalysis has been demonstrated in the synthesis and modification of complex biologically active molecules with controllable E/Z selectivity. This work sheds light on the design and control of artificial supramolecular counterparts of enzymes, offering fundamental insights into the factors influencing the activity and catalytic selectivity of biological macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Vertically Expanded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation into Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks with unique &#960; architectures and pores could be developed as photocatalysts for transformations. However, they usually form &#960;&#8208;stacking layers, so that only surface layers function in photocatalysis. Here we report a strategy for developing vertically expanded frameworks to expose originally inaccessible active sites hidden in layers to catalysis. We designed covalently linked two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) porphyrin layers and explored coordination bonds to connect the cobalt(II) porphyrin layers with bidentate ligands via a three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot polymerization. The frameworks expand the interlayer space greatly, where both the up and down faces of each cobalt(II) porphyrin layer are exposed to reactants. Unexpectedly, the vertically expanded frameworks increase skeleton oxidation potentials, decrease exciton dissociation energy, improve pore hydrophilicity and affinity to water, and facilitate water delivery. Remarkably, these positive effects work collectively in the photocatalysis of water oxidation into oxygen, with an oxygen production rate of 1155 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, a quantum efficiency of 1.24% at 450 nm, and a turnover frequency of 1.39 h&#8722;1, which is even 5.1&#8208;fold as high as that of the &#960;&#8208;stacked frameworks and ranks them the most effective photocatalysts. This strategy offers a new platform for designing layer frameworks to build various catalytic systems for chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Chain Rearrangement of Natural Cellulose&#8208;based Artificial Interphase for Ultra&#8208;stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unstable electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, plagued by parasitic side reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth, severely hampers the practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To address these challenges, we developed a regenerated cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase with synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry on the Zn anode (RC@Zn), using a facile molecular chain rearrangement strategy. This RC interphase features a drastically increased amorphous region and more exposed active hydroxyl groups, facilitating rapid Zn2+ diffusion&#160;and homogeneous Zn2+ interface distribution, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Additionally, the compact texture and abundant negatively charged surface of the RC interphase effectively shield water molecules and harmful anions, completely preventing H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. The superior mechanical strength and adhesion of the RC interphase also accommodate the substantial volume changes of Zn anodes even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently,&#160;the RC@Zn electrode demonstrates an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000 hours at a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Significantly, the electrode maintains stable cycling even at a 90% depth of discharge and ensures stable operation of full cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.6. This study provides new solution to construct highly stable and deep cycling Zn metal anodes through interface engineering.</dc:description>

This study provides new solution to construct highly stable and deep cycling Zn metal anodes through interface engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired synthesis of cucurbalsaminones B and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cucurbalsaminones B (1) and C (2) are two abeo&#8208;cucurbitane triterpenoids with a unique 5/6/3/6/5&#8208;fused ring system and exhibited potent multidrug resistance (MDR)&#8208;reversing activity. Herein, we report the first synthesis of these two natural products, both of them were accomplished in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8208;Meerwein type lanostane&#8208;to&#8208;cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation to realize the challenging oxidation state adjustment of the sterically hindered C11 position.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Fluorination Modulates Crystallinity and Aggregation of Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High dark current density (Jd) severely hinders further advancement of near&#8208;infrared organic photodetectors (NIR OPDs). Herein, we tackle this grand challenge by regulating molecular crystallinity and aggregation of fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (FNREAs). In contrast to the general trend in terminal halogenation of electron acceptors, TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F, featuring fluorinated terminals, notably demonstrates crystalline intensification and a higher prevalence predominance of J&#8208;aggregate compared to its chlorinated counterpart (TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl). The amalgamation of advantages confers TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs with more organized active layer morphology and denser molecular packing, resulting in improved charge transport, decreased energetic disorder, and reduced trap density. Consequently, the corresponding self&#8208;powered OPDs exhibit a 40&#8208;fold decrease in Jd, a remarkable increase in detectivity (D*sh), faster response time, and superior thermal stability compared to TBT&#8208;V&#8208;Cl&#8208;based OPDs. Further interfacial optimization results in an ultra&#8208;low Jd of 7.30&#180;10&#8208;12 A cm&#8208;2 with D*sh over 1013 Jones in 320&#8208;920 nm wavelength and a climax of 2.2&#180;1014 Jones at 800 nm for the TBT&#8208;V&#8208;F&#8208;based OPDs, representing one of the best results reported to date. This work paves a compelling material&#8208;based strategy to suppress Jd for highly sensitive NIR OPDs, while also illustrates the viability of FNREAs in construction of stable and affordable NIR OPDs for real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Cumulene Character of One&#8208;Dimensional Acetylene&#8208;Based Systems by Stimuli&#8208;Induced Planarization of Their Two Pro&#8208;diradicaloid Cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene Units</title>

         <dc:description>Acetylene/polyynes &#8211;(C&#8801;C&#8211;)n and cumulenes =(C=)n are connectors widely used for the realization of one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) &#960;&#8208;conjugates. Although both &#960;&#8208;moieties are constituted by sp carbon atoms, their different bond connectivity confers distinct physicochemical properties to the resulting systems. In this context, while many acetylene/polyyne&#8208; and cumulene&#8208;based derivatives have been prepared and studied, no reports have tackled the possibility to reversibly alter the acetylene/polyyne&#8208;cumulene electronic character of these derivatives using mild conditions. Herein, we present a novel approach to enhance the cumulene character of 1&#8208;D acetylene&#8208;based conjugates consisting in the preparation of derivatives featuring an acetylene moiety connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene (CPA), at their pro&#8208;radical positions. A thoughtful spectroscopic study of the prepared dimers, complemented by theoretical calculations, suggest a high &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization of the pro&#8208;diradicaloid CPAs through the central acetylene spacer upon the dimers&#8217; planarization which, in turn, increases the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge, a feature enhanced for one of the two dimers at low temperature and in methylcyclohexane due to an aggregation&#8208;induced planarization process. We reckon that the proposed approach offers an interesting avenue towards the realization of 1&#8208;D systems which cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;connector could be altered in response to external stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea/Thiourea Imine Linkages Provide Accessible Holes in Flexible Covalent Organic Frameworks and Dominates Self&#8208;Adaptivity and Exciton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the robust self&#8208;adaptivity and minimal energy&#8208;dissipation of soft reticular materials for environmental catalysis presents a compelling yet unexplored avenue. Herein, a top&#8208;down strategy, tailoring from the unique linkage basis, flexibility degree, skeleton electronics to trace&#8208;guest adaptability, is proposed to fill the understanding gap between micro&#8208;soft covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and photocatalytic performance. The thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene&#8208;based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro&#8208;flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro&#8208;flexible thiourea&#8208;COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100% removal of micropollutant with low&#8208;energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes&#8208;mediated micropollutant decomposition.</dc:description>

The thio(urea)-basis-dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene-based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro-flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro-flexible thiourea-COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100% removal of micropollutant with low-energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes-mediated micropollutant decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comediating Adsorption and Electron Transfer via Dual&#8208;Active Site Catalyst Construction for Improving the Treatment of Extraction Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent extraction is widely applied, while extraction wastewater treatment remains a huge&#160;challenge&#160;because of the stability of extractants.&#160;Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis is a promising method, but the short half&#8208;life of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH)&#160;generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#160;activation results in unsatisfactory &#8226;OH utilization and organics removal.&#160;Herein, an efficient strategy for treating extraction wastewater based on comediating adsorption and electron transfer by fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active site was developed. Specially, N sites adsorb organics and&#160;F&#160;sites activate&#160;H2O2, shortening the migration distance&#160;of &#8226;OH. Theoretical calculation and di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA)&#160;extraction wastewater degradation experiment&#160;showed that F site&#160;with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by electron&#8208;rich D2EHPA enriched at N sites to&#160;H2O2,&#160;facilitating the continuous generation of &#8226;OH through lowering the energy barrier for H2O2&#160;activation.&#160;As a result, 96.49% D2EHPA in simulated wastewater&#160;and 90.26% total organic carbon&#160;in real&#160;extraction wastewater&#160;were removed. Moreover, FNC catalyst&#160;exhibited excellent reusability and ionic adaptability, and can be extended to the removal of various extractants. The proposed dual&#8208;active site catalyst provides&#160;an effective strategy&#160;for&#160;Fenton&#8208;like&#160;reaction&#160;to&#160;treat&#160;refractory extraction wastewater, promoting&#160;sustainable development of solvent extraction industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8211;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8211;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive Fabrication of a Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Catalyst toward Highly Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as burgeoning heterogeneous catalysts due to their vast material space, unique structure, and superior stability. However, the dominant trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches hamper the exploration of efficient catalysts, necessitating the development of rational design strategies. Here, we report a progressive approach to the design and fabrication of HEA catalysts guided by alloying effects toward propane dehydrogenation. Cu, Sn, Au, and Pd are selected and demonstrated to induce dilution, encapsulation, surface enrichment, and inhomogeneity effects on Pt. The fabricated HEA, PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability. The propylene formation rates reach 256 and 390 molC3H6 gPt&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 550 and 600 &#176;C, respectively. Systematic characterizations reveal that the random elemental mixing, structural stability, and high Pt exposure promote the exposure of abundant stable isolated Pt sites. This work comprehensively explores the rational design and fabrication of HEA catalysts from a unique perspective, offering opportunities for developing advanced catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of&#160;Covalent Organic Frameworks with Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt for C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received great attention for their unique features, but the limited building blocks restrict their structural diversity and performance exploration. Reticular chemistry provides guidance for the structural expansion and performance regulation of COFs. Herein, we constructed two novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs functionalized with cyclopentadienyl cobalt, denoted as UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;2, via [4+2] imine condensation with diamine building blocks of different length. Theoretical simulations combined with experimental results reveal that UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with shorter building blocks, narrower pore sizes, and stronger host&#8208;guest interactions has better C2H2/CO2 separation performance. In addition, UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 can maintain separation stability in the presence of water vapor and methane impurities. This work provides a new evidence for the performance regulation of isoreticular COFs with modular and tunable building blocks.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group translocation is undoubtedly a pivotal synthetic transformation in organic chemistry. Numerous types of reactions involving radical 1,2&#8208;aryl or 1,4&#8208;aryl migration via electron transfer mechanism have been extensively investigated. Nevertheless, energy&#8208;transfer enabled 1,4&#8208;arylation remains unknown. Herein we disclose that an unprecedented di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement featuring 1,4&#8208;aryl migration facilitated by energy transfer catalysis under visible light conditions. The newly developed mild protocol exhibits tolerance towards diverse functional groups and enables the migration of a multitude of aromatic rings, encompassing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;rich functional groups. The open&#8208;shell strategy has also found successful application in the modification of several drugs. Large&#8208;scale experiments, continuous&#8208;flow experiment, and versatile manipulation of products have demonstrated the robustness and potential utility of this synthetic method. Preliminary mechanistic studies have supported the involvement of radical species in this di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement and have also provided evidence for the energy transfer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;atom Barium Promoter Enormously Enhanced Non&#8208;noble Metal Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a well&#8208;established topic, single&#8208;atom catalyst has drawn growing interest for its high utilization of metal. However, researchers prefer to develop various active metals with single&#8208;atom form, the intrinsic roles of single&#8208;atom promoters are usually underrated, which are significant in boosting reaction activity. In this work, Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co&#8208;Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor under the ammonia decomposition reaction condition.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a well-established topic, single-atom catalyst has drawn growing interest for its high utilization of metal. However, researchers prefer to develop various active metals with single-atom form, the intrinsic roles of single-atom promoters are usually underrated, which are significant in boosting reaction activity. In this work, Ba single atoms were in situ prepared in the Co-Ba/Y2O3 catalyst with crystallized BaCO3 as the precursor under the ammonia decomposition reaction condition. The optimized Co-Ba/Y2O3 catalyst achieves extremely high H2 production rate of 138.3 mmolH2&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;min&#8722;1 at very low temperature (500 &#176;C, GHSV = 840,000 mL&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) and Co-Ba/Y2O3 exhibits excellent durability during the 350 h test, which realizes the highest activity among all non-noble catalysts, and reaches or even exceeds numerous reported Ru-based catalysts.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol based on a Molecule/Nanocarbon Hybrid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion provides an intriguing route for both solar energy storage and CO2 mitigation. For scalable applications, near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity is highly desirable to reduce the energy and cost endowed by low&#8208;value byproducts and complex separation processes, but so far has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate a molecule/nanocarbon hybrid catalyst composed of carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc/CNT), which synergistically integrates high photothermal conversion capability for affording an optimal reaction temperature with homogeneous and intrinsically&#8208;efficient active sites, to achieve a catalytic activity of 2.4 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and selectivity of ~99% in direct photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Both theoretical calculations and operando characterizations consistently confirm that the unique electronic structure of CoPc and appropriate reaction temperature cooperatively enable a thermodynamic favorable reaction pathway for highly selective methanol production. This work represents an important milestone towards the development of advanced photothermal catalysts for scalable and cost&#8208;effective CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom efficient method of producing diborane from borohydride sources has been provided. Ionic liquids provide a controlled source of boron trifluoride which acts as a Lewis acid to release diborane. The EMIM generated from the ionic liquid also burns effectively in air making a highly efficient fuel source which combusts in air.







Abstract
Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3D printed propellant formulation was also tested.

         <title>Aromative Dephosphinidenation of a Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene toward E&#8722;H (E=H, Si, N and P) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a bulky amino substituent at phosphorous enables the development of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene. This compound serves as an efficient phosphinidene synthon, thermally releasing transient phosphinidenes shown to activate dihydrogen (H2), E&#8722;H (E=Si, N and P) bonds and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (5) was prepared by treatment of a sterically encumbered amino phosphorus dichloride (3) with MgA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 (A=anthracene). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a pentacyclic framework consisting of 5 with two phosphirane rings fused to the anthracene in a trans&#8208;fashion. Compound 5 has been shown to be an efficient phosphinidene synthon, readily liberating two transient phosphinidene units for subsequent downstream bond activation via the reductive elimination of anthracene under mild conditions. The formal oxidative addition of H2 and E&#8722;H (E=Si, N, P) bonds by the liberated phosphinidene provided diphosphine and substituted phosphines. Furthermore, phosphinidene transfer to alkenes and alkynes smoothly yielded the corresponding phosphiranes and phosphirenes. The mechanism of the H2 activation by 5 was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Multiple Functional Bonds Integrated Interphases for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional bonds integrated strategy is proposed to regulate cathode electrolyte interphase by the trip&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). It endows the 3&#8197;Ah hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 pouch full cell with a capacity retention up to 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4&#8722; is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6&#8722; in PC&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+&#8208;FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+&#8208;PC and participation of SN and PF6&#8722; anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3&#8197;Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of SIBs.

         <title>Chemodivergent Parallel Kinetic Resolution of Paracyclophanes: Enantiomer Fishing with Different Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of catalytic strategy in asymmetric synthesis is disclosed, through which the parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) of the racemic substrate can be realized with two distinct achiral reactants. The current study also represents the seminal investigations on the PKR reaction of racemic compounds bearing planar chirality, the chemodivergent PKR reaction with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, and the catalytic approach for the preparation of chiral pyridines bearing multi&#8208;functionalities.







Abstract
An unprecedented chemodivergent strategy for parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) is disclosed through which two planar chiral products bearing different structures were simultaneously afforded with opposite stereoselectivities. Two achiral esters are activated by one single chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to react with the different enantiomers of the racemic imine substrate in a parallel fashion. Two products bearing distinct structures and opposite stereoselectivities are respectively afforded from the same reaction system in good to excellent yields, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Control experiments and kinetic studies are carried out to probe the kinetic and dynamic properties during the reaction progress. The planar chiral pyridine and lactam products show interesting applications in both asymmetric synthesis and pesticide development.

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SBnCln Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>

Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral closo&#8208;boranes of various sizes by co&#8208;pyrolyzing the simple electron&#8208;precise synthons S2Cl2 and B2Cl4 at 280&#8201;&#176;C, closo&#8208;SB5Cl5, closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 and closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction. MS spectra and computations evidenced the recurrent formation of further closo&#8208;SBnCln , with n=4, 6, 10, and also with 12 designed for the supra&#8208;icosahedral architecture.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass&#8208;spectrometry evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of closo&#8208;SBnCln with n=4, 6, 10, and supra&#8208;icosahedral 12.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2 Catalysts in Li&#8722;S Batteries by Anion&#8208;Cation Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion P and cation Mo co&#8208;doped MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) electrocatalyst was designed for durable Li&#8722;S batteries. Such P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 electrocatalyst combine strong anchoring for polysulfides with the uniquely selective bi&#8208;directional electrocatalytic activity for nucleation and dissociation of Li2S, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and achieving simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li2S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce the cyclability of Li&#8722;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion&#8208;cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li2S. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the pivotal role of dopants in fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;band center and optimizing the electronic structure of MnO2. Furthermore, this well&#8208;designed configuration processes catalytic selectivity. Specifically, P&#8208;doping expedites rapid Li2S nucleation kinetics by minimizing reaction&#8208;free energy, while Mo&#8208;doping facilitates robust Li2S dissolution kinetics by mitigating decomposition barriers. This dual&#8208;doping approach equips P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 with robust bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity, effectively overcoming passivation effect and suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. Consequently, Li&#8722;S batteries incorporating P,Mo&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based separators demonstrate favorable performance than pristine TMOs. This design offers rational viewpoint for the development of catalytic materials with superior bi&#8208;directional sulfur electrocatalytic in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Radical Isomerization Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Access C5, C6 or C7 Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical isomerization homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been successfully developed. Utilizing various monomers, the radical translocation pathway involving cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer occurs with remarkable efficiency and selectivity. These distinct propagation mechanisms enable C5, C6, or C7 polymerizations with precise control over monomer composition and main chain sequence.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated linear &#945;&#8208;olefins are valuable building blocks for organic transformation or olefin (co)polymerization, but they are recognized as textbook knowledge for non&#8208;homopolymerizable monomers under radical conditions. In this article, we disclose our effort to achieve an unprecedented library of all carbon&#8208;bonded sequence&#8208;regulated polymers via radical isomerization homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefin derivatives. The success of this distinctive polymerization is attributed to the remarkable efficiency and selectivity exhibited during the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer, which is greatly enhanced by the precise engineering of their monomer structures. This polymerization process enables the elongation of polymer chains by five, six, or seven carbon atoms at each propagation step. These polymers, obtained through the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer involved radical isomerization polymerization processes, emerge as promising candidates resembling polyethylene or polyacrylonitrile copolymers.

         <title>A Computation&#8208;Guided Design of Highly Defined and Dense Bimetallic Active Sites on a Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>

This paper designs a substrate&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional conducting metal&#8211;organic framework with high density of active sites (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)) as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. This strategy provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites. Moreover, thermodynamics and kinetics are combined to explain the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental conclusions, which provides a referable direction for further computationally guided experiments.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of CoN4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90&#8201;%/85&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8211;0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications. This strategy thus provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites, promoting high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2 and beyond.

         <title>Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;Based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic measurements, combined with operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ microscopy characterization provided new insights on the carbon formation pathway over Rhodium&#8208;based catalyst materials during methane dry reforming, which allowed to relate the reaction kinetics with changes in catalyst structure under true reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mechanism for carbon deposition and its impact on the reaction kinetics of Methane Dry Reforming (MDR) using Rhodium&#8208;based catalysts is presented. By integrating Raman spectroscopy with kinetic analysis in an operando&#8208;annular chemical reactor under strict chemical conditions, we discovered that carbon deposition on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst follows a nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism. The dynamics of carbon aggregates at the surface is found to be ruled by the CO2/CH4 ratio and the inlet CH4 concentration. The findings elucidate the spatiotemporal development of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their effects on catalytic performance. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for carbon formation shows that the influence of CO2 on MDR kinetics is an indirect result of carbon accumulation over time frames exceeding the turnover frequency, thus reconciling conflicting reports in the literature regarding CO2&#8242;s kinetic role in MDR.

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Phase Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;Situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem solid&#8208;solution phase post&#8208;synthetic modifications were realized based on porous molecular crystals. The sequential reactions involve addition reaction with hydrazine hydrate and condensation reaction with alkyl aldehydes, resulting in the production of three molecular frameworks in a quantitative manner, accompanied by solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow).







Abstract
Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution phase reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.

         <title>A Photocrosslinking Probe to Capture the Substrates of Caseinolytic Protease P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy using trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) and capture substrates within the barrel via a photocrosslinking moiety upon UV irradiation. The probes retain protease activity and capture numerous known and novel substrates of ClpP, allowing the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.







Abstract
Protein homeostasis in bacteria is regulated by proteases such as the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). Although substrates of ClpP have been successfully deciphered in genetically engineered cells, methods which directly trap processed proteins within native cells remain elusive. Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy which utilizes trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of ClpP and capture adjacent substrates with an attached photocrosslinking moiety. After enrichment using an alkyne handle, substrate deconvolution by mass spectrometry (MS) is performed. We show that our two traps bind substoichiometrically to ClpP, retain protease activity, exhibit unprecedented selectivity for Staphylococcus aureus ClpP in living cells and capture numerous known and novel substrates. The exemplary validation of trapped hits using a targeted proteomics approach confirmed the fidelity of this technology. In conclusion, we provide a novel chemical platform suited for the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.

To explore the combinatorial space of peptidomimetics with a broad selection of building blocks, not limited to the 20&#8197;natural amino acids, we have developed a chemical evolution process. Ancestral molecules can be generated by screening an initial library with representative building blocks. Unbiased random mutagenesis in natural evolution was replaced by the chemoinformatics&#8208;based design of iteration cycles. We can generate tens of thousands of mutations and explore an expansive combinatory space exceeding 1017, allowing the discovery of high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;generations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;natural building blocks (BBs) present a vast reservoir of chemical diversity for molecular recognition and drug discovery. However, leveraging evolutionary principles to efficiently generate bioactive molecules with a larger number of diverse BBs poses challenges within current laboratory evolution systems. Here, we introduce programmable chemical evolution (PCEvo) by integrating chemoinformatic classification and high&#8208;throughput array synthesis/screening. PCEvo initiates evolution by constructing a diversely combinatorial library to create ancestral molecules, streamlines the molecular evolution process and identifies high&#8208;affinity binders within 2&#8211;4&#8197;cycles. By employing PCEvo with 108 BBs and exploring &gt;1017 chemical space, we identify bicyclic peptidomimetic binders against targets SAR&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and Claudin18.2, achieving nanomolar affinity. Remarkably, Claudin18.2 binders selectively stain gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines and patient samples. PCEvo achieves expedited evolution in a few rounds, marking a significant advance in utilizing non&#8208;natural building blocks for rapid chemical evolution applicable to targets with or without prior structural information and ligand preference.

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient method for the C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines was developed using readily available sulfinates and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This photoinduced radical approach enables the difunctionalization of alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane, providing access to a wide variety of fluoroalkylated pyridines.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, challenges are often faced with conventional Minisci reactions in achieving precise regioselectivity owing to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Reversible Local Protonation&#8208;Deprotonation: Tuning Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Zinc Halides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnX4 and monoprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnX4 (X=Cl, Br) were constructed from a single chiral organic cation. The reversible structural transformation induced by polar solvents and HBr/heat engenders chiroptical switching behaviors. The structural design strategy developed in this work elucidates the structure&#8208;property mechanism underlying the structural transitions and the distortion&#8208;related chirality transfer.







Abstract
Precise control over the organic composition is crucial for tailoring the distinctive structures and properties of hybrid metal halides. However, this approach is seldom utilized to develop materials that exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of enantiomeric hybrid zinc bromides: biprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H16N2)ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnBr4) and monoprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H15N2)2ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnBr4), derived from the chiral organic amine (R/S)&#8208;2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine ((R/S)&#8208;C12H14N2). These compounds showcase luminescent properties; the zero&#8208;dimensional biprotonated form emits green light at 505&#8197;nm, while the monoprotonated form, with a pseudo&#8208;layered structure, displays red luminescence at 599 and 649&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the reversible local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior of the organic cations allows for exposure to polar solvents and heating to induce reversible structural and luminescent transformations between the two forms. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower energy barrier associated with the deprotonation process within the pyrrole ring is responsible for the local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior observed. These enantiomorphic hybrid zinc bromides also exhibit switchable circular dichroism (CD) and CPL properties. Furthermore, their chloride counterparts were successfully obtained by adjusting the halogen ions. Importantly, the unique stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL characteristics position these hybrid zinc halides as promising candidates for applications in information storage, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs). The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism, which transforms a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.







Abstract
Thorium, a predominant actinide in the Earth's crust, presents significant environmental and health risks due to its radioactive nature. These risks are particularly pronounced during the mining and processing of monazite for rare earth elements (REEs), which contain substantial thorium concentrations. Current instrumental analysis methods for thorium, offer high accuracy but require laborious sample preparations and expensive instruments, making them unsuitable for on&#8208;site analysis. Herein, we present a class of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as fluorochromic sensors for Th4+ cations. Utilizing a heterobimetallic Eu3+/Tb3+ doping strategy, the luminescence colors of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH can be finely tuned from red, to orange, and to green. More intriguingly, the higher Lewis acidity of Th4+ facilitates the transformation of EuxTb1&#8208;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH into a UiO&#8208;type Th&#8208;MOF via a dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism. This process results in a gradual reduction of characteristic Ln3+ emissions and the emergence of blue color ligand&#8208;based fluorescence, thereby leading to selective fluorochromic responses with increasing Th4+ concentrations and enabling visible detection of Th4+ cations. Additionally, a custom&#8208;built portable optoelectronic device is fabricated, which directly converts luminescence colors into red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) values. This device enables easy quantification of Th4+ concentrations without the need for complex instrumentation.

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

         <title>Phosphonium Iodide Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Highly Efficient X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of phosphonium iodide featuring blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence was reported. Benefitting from the efficient exciton utilization, near&#8208;unity PLQY, large Stokes shift, and high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability contributed by I&#8722;, the prepared phosphonium iodide delivers outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, providing the application potential in high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Organic scintillators are praised for their abundant element reserves, facile preparation procedures, and rich structures. However, the weak X&#8208;ray attenuation ability and low exciton utilization efficiency result in unsatisfactory scintillation performance. Herein, a new family of highly efficient organic phosphonium halide salts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are designed by innovatively adopting quaternary phosphonium as the electron acceptor, while dimethylamine group and halide anions (I&#8722;) serve as the electron donor. The prepared butyl(2&#8208;[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]phenyl)diphenylphosphonium iodide (C4&#8208;I) exhibits bright blue emission and an ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100&#8201;%. Efficient charge transfer is realized through the unique n&#8208;&#960; and anion&#8208;&#960; stacking in solid&#8208;state C4&#8208;I. Photophysical studies of C4&#8208;I suggest that the incorporation of I accounts for high intersystem crossing rate (kISC) and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), suppressing the intrinsic prompt fluorescence and enabling near&#8208;pure TADF emission at room temperature. Benefitting from the large Stokes shift, high PLQY, efficient exciton utilization, and remarkable X&#8208;ray attenuation ability endowed by I, C4&#8208;I delivers an outstanding light yield of 80721 photons/MeV and a low limit of detection (LoD) of 22.79&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1. This work would provide a rational design concept and open up an appealing road for developing efficient organic scintillators with tunable emission, strong X&#8208;ray attenuation ability, and excellent scintillator performance.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale autonomous oscillatory motion was achieved upon the reduction of a perylenediimide disk at the solid&#8208;water interface. This redox&#8208;activated, self&#8208;propelled system can be modulated through variations in chemical structure and molecular alignment, offering a unique avenue for the construction of molecularly designed active matter.







Abstract
The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8208;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water&#8208;soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of the imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Focus Workflow for Simultaneously Engineering High Activity and Thermal Stability in Methyl Parathion Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;focus computationally guided iterative mutagenesis workflow was developed to simultaneously improve stability and activity in methyl parathion hydrolase. Thus, this study details a strategic innovation to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in protein engineering and can guide future efforts to design stable, highly active enzymes with defined structure&#8208;function relationships.







Abstract
Industrial fermentation applications typically require enzymes that exhibit high stability and activity at high temperatures. However, efforts to simultaneously improve these properties are usually limited by a trade&#8208;off between stability and activity. This report describes a computational strategy to enhance both activity and thermal stability of the mesophilic organophosphate&#8208;degrading enzyme, methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). To predict hotspot mutation sites, we assembled a library of features associated with the target properties for each residue and then prioritized candidate sites by hierarchical clustering. Subsequent in silico screening with multiple algorithms to simulate selective pressures yielded a subset of 23&#8197;candidate mutations. Iterative parallel screening of mutations that improved thermal stability and activity yielded, MPHase&#8208;m5b, which exhibited 13.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm and 4.2&#8197;times higher catalytic activity than wild&#8208;type (WT) MPH over a wide temperature range. Systematic analysis of crystal structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations revealed a wider entrance to the active site that increased substrate access with an extensive network of interactions outside the active site that reinforced &#945;&#946;/&#946;&#945; sandwich architecture to improve thermal stability. This study thus provides an advanced, rational design framework to improve efficiency in engineering highly active, thermostable biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Novel Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Interactions in Polymer&#8208;Derived Sodium&#8208;Doped Amorphous Si&#8722;B&#8722;N Ceramic: Towards Main&#8208;Group&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Activation</title>

We explored the Polymer&#8208;Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal&#8208;free sodium&#8208;doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na+ and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H2 exposure. This FLP&#8208;inspired approach promises advances in main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH3) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8722;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&#8722;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.







Abstract
Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5&#8201;%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high&#8208;performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam from 4.0&#8197;g of lignin raw material.

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spoked wheels containing fluorene spokes were successfully prepared and characterized by various methods, including scanning tunneling microscopy. Their synthetic accessibility was correlated with quantum chemical calculations using geometric and energetic criteria, the former extracted from the theoretically proposed mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling, the latter from experimental cyclophane synthesis.







Abstract
A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes, and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling lead to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.

         <title>Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture</title>

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework possesses synergistic C2H2 binding sites on its pore surface, firstly realizing one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2 mixture.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C2H6 and C2H2. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture because of the low C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C2H6 and C2H2 preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF&#8208;TDCPB can not only obtain high&#8208;purity C2H4 from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture, with the C2H4 productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF&#8208;TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high&#8208;humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C2H2, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Cu&#8208;Doped NiCo Alloy Supported on Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu doped NiCo alloy supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) is synthesized. Because Cu doping facilitates the coupling of reaction intermediates with surface adsorbed oxygen, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and formate Faraday efficiency. Besides, a coupled system of glycerol oxidation with nitrate reduction is constructed, which further enhances the activity, reduces energy consumption and gains valuable ammonia simultaneously.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol which is regarded as a main byproduct of industrial biodiesel production, is an innovative strategy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals, but currently showcases slow kinetics, limited Faraday efficiency, and unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency electrooxidation of glycerol into formate via a Cu doped NiCo alloy catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) in a coupled system paired with nitrate reduction. The designed Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF delivers only 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record Faraday efficiency of formate of 93.8&#8201;%. The superior performance is ascribed to the rapid generation of NiIII&#8722;OOH and CoIII&#8722;OOH species and favorable coupling of surface *O with reactive intermediates. Using Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF as a bifunctional catalyst, the coupled system synchronously produces NH3 and formate, showing 290&#8197;mV lower than the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction, together with excellent long&#8208;term stability for up to 144&#8197;h. This work lays out new guidelines and reliable strategies from catalyst design to system coupling for biomass&#8208;derived electrochemical refinery.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;site bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction. The crucial role of hybrid dual sites is determined and assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water. A record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at 18&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution and a low voltage for overall water splitting was achieved on these heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8722;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in situ formed Fe&#8722;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at current density of 18.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative B&#8592;N bonds simultaneously integrate solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect and visible light reactivity into a crystalline supramolecular host. Alkenes organized by B&#8592;N bonds enable rapid guest release within the host upon visible light exposure in air through [2+2] photocycloaddition. Benefiting from the reversible structural transformation between B&#8592;N host and adduct cocrystal, a customized capture and release of guests is realized.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447&#8197;nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented organocatalytic asymmetric entry to a range of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer catalysis was developed. The utilization of this protocol enables the remote desymmetric functionalization of prochiral cages with high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, diverse late&#8208;stage molecular editing of chiral prism&#8208;like cages was primed for an array of high&#8208;value chiral compounds.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

         <title>Supramolecular Anchoring of Fe(III) Molecular Redox Catalysts into Graphitic Surfaces Via CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile model has been developed for supramolecular anchoring including CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, between iron porphyrin catalysts and graphitic surfaces, enabling a high&#8208;performance molecular electrode for aqueous CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical devices require solid anodes and cathodes for the easy assembling of the whole cell and thus redox catalysts need to be deposited on the electrodes. Typical catalyst deposition involves drop casting, spin coating, doctor blading or related techniques to generate modified electrodes where the active catalyst in contact with the electrolyte is only a very small fraction of the deposited mass. We have developed a methodology where the redox catalyst is deposited at the electrode based on supramolecular interactions, namely CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; between the catalyst and the surface. This generates a very well&#8208;defined catalysts&#8208;surface structure and electroactivity, together with a very large catalytic response. This approach represents a new anchoring strategy that can be applied to catalytic redox reactions in heterogeneous phase and compared to traditional methods involves about 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude less mass deposition to achieve comparable activity and with very well&#8208;behaved electroactivity and stability.

         <title>Regulating Atomically&#8208;Precise Pt Sites for Boosting Light&#8208;Driven Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic structure of Pt single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitates robust electronic interactions with the substrate, providing an optimal spatial and electronic framework for activating and converting CO2&#8722;CH4 molecules. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, highlighting the critical role of atomically&#8208;precise interface adjustment in multi&#8208;molecule systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane is a promising and mild route to convert two greenhouse gas into valuable syngas. However, developing facile strategy to atomically&#8208;precise regulate the active sites and realize balanced and stable syngas production is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spatial confinement approach to precisely control over platinum species on TiO2 surfaces, from single atoms to nanoclusters. The configuration comprising single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters engenders pronounced electronic metal&#8208;support interactions, with resultant interfacial states prompting surface charge rearrangement. The unique geometric and electronic properties of these atom&#8208;cluster assemblies facilitate effective activation of CH4 and CO2, accelerating intermediate coupling and minimizing side reactions. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, displaying high apparent quantum yield of 9.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and turnover frequency of 1289&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work provides insightful understanding for exploring more multi&#8208;molecule systems at an atomic scale.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis of zinc cyclopropoxide enables a stereoselective hydroxyallylation of cyclopropenes with enolized homoenolate as a transient prochiral nucleophile, thus affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. An enantioselective variant has also been achieved using a chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC.







Abstract
A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Decorated Rhodium Nanoparticles Incorporated in Covalent Organic Framework for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny Rh nanoparticles (NPs) are encapsulated in a covalent organic framework and then decorated with chiral diene ligands to create chiral microenvironment for asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. The results demonstrate that decorating the Rh NPs with ligands initiates activity, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the ligand and the substrate are crucial for achieving high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
While metal nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated their great potential in catalysis, introducing chiral microenvironment around metal NPs to achieve efficient conversion and high enantioselectivity remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this work, tiny Rh NPs, modified by chiral diene ligands (Lx) bearing diverse functional groups, are incorporated into a covalent organic framework (COF) for the asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition reactions between arylboronic acids and nitroalkenes. Though Rh NPs hosted in the COF are inactive, decorating Rh NPs with Lx creates the active Rh&#8722;Lx interface and induces high activity. Moreover, chiral microenvironment modulation around Rh NPs by altering the groups on chiral diene ligands greatly optimizes the enantioselectivity (up to 95.6&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic investigations indicate that the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between Lx and nitroalkenes plays critical roles in the resulting enantioselectivity. This work highlights the significance of chiral microenvironment modulation around metal NPs by chiral ligand decoration for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Vaporchromic Domino Transformation and Polarized Photonic Heterojunctions of Organoplatinum Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into crystalline microrods by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. CH2Cl2&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered domino transformation or patterned&#8208;mask&#8208;assisted vapor treatment transforms these microrods into multiblock polarized photonic heterojunctions with alternate yellow/red phosphorescence and orthogonal polarization directions, as a result of the vaporchromic switching of crystal packing and excited&#8208;state properties.







Abstract
Photonic heterostructures with codable properties have shown great values as versatile information carriers at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. These heterostructures are typically prepared by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step growth or post&#8208;functionalization method to achieve varied emission colors with different building blocks. In order to realize high&#8208;throughput and multivariate information loading, we report here a strategy to integrate polarization signals into photonic heterojunctions. A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex has been assembled into highly polarized yellow&#8208;phosphorescent crystalline microrods (Y&#8208;rod) by strong intermolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction. Upon end&#8208;initiated desorption of the incorporated CH2Cl2 solvents, the Y&#8208;rod is transformed in a domino fashion into tri&#8208;block polarized photonic heterojunctions (PPHs) with alternate red&#8208;yellow&#8208;red emissions or red&#8208;phosphorescent microrods (R&#8208;rods). The red emissions of these structures are also highly polarized; however, their polarization directions are just orthogonal to those of the yellow phosphorescence of the Y&#8208;rod. With the aid of a patterned mask, the R&#8208;rod can be further programmed into multi&#8208;block PPHs with precisely controlled block sizes by side&#8208;allowed adsorption of CH2Cl2 vapor. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that the solvent&#8208;regulated modulation of the crystal packing and excited&#8208;state property is critical for the construction of these PPHs.

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;Capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel dissymmetric quinoidal molecules end&#8208;capped by dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium were reported and their formation mechanism was proposed. The respective zwitterionic forms make contributions to their ground state structures. Of particular note is the observation that their emissions can be switched on by increasing the solution viscosity, by dispersing them in polymer matrix, or upon binding with certain proteins.







Abstract
A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant fluorescence improvement and considerable piezochromism are firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Pressure&#8208;induced photocurrent enhancement is also observed, because of the promoted electron orbitals coupling resulting from the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1&#8197;atm to 2.5&#8197;GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8722;I&#8722;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.

The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure-optical relationships of ACI-type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure-suppressed nonradiative recombination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Brings High Electron Delocalization for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural systems optimize charge carrier behavior via molecular spatial arrangement, a phenomenon largely unexplored in artificial systems. PFC&#8208;1, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with controllable &#960;&#8208;stacking, offers valuable insights into this process. Varying &#960;&#8208;stacking perpendicular to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in HOFs alters electron density, redox potential, and charge carrier transport and separation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance.







Abstract
Unlike many studies that regulate transport and separation behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers through controlling the chemical composite, our work demonstrates this goal can be achieved through simply tuning the molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) without altering the building blocks or network topology. Further investigations reveal that the long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking significantly promotes electron delocalization and enhances electron density, thereby effectively suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination and augmenting the charge transfer rate. Simultaneously, acting as a porous substrate, it boosts electron density of Pd nanoparticle loaded on its surfaces, resulting in remarkable CO2 photoreduction catalytic activity (CO generation rate: 48.1&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h) without the need for hole scavengers. Our study provide insight into regulating the charge carrier behaviours in molecular assemblies based on hydrogen bonds, offering a new clue for efficient photocatalyst design.

         <title>Steering the Site Distance of Atomic Cu&#8722;Cu Pairs by First&#8208;Shell Halogen Coordination Boosts CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Selectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
The atomic Cu&#8722;Cu pairs with a controllable site distance by first&#8208;shell halogen coordination was reported in this work, which shows an enhanced CO2RR performance of C2 products. In addition, a linear scaling relationship that that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites is accelerated to C2H4 generation, while short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites is beneficial for C2H5OH formation was revealed to give a wide comprehension towards site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8722;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first&#8208;shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1&#8201;%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites are accelerated to C2H4 generation and short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites are beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites.

         <title>Boosting Organic Solar Cells to Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency through Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Fluorinated Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>

Harnessing dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, NFREA 412&#8208;6F with halogen atoms exhibit exceptional crystallinity and improved charge transport. The D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend in OSCs shows enhanced efficiency over 18&#8201;%. 412&#8208;6F&#8242;s lower MOC compared to Y6 underscores its cost&#8208;effectiveness. This innovative approach in non&#8208;covalent forces yields a high&#8208;performance electron acceptor for superior photovoltaic outcomes.







Abstract
This study successfully designed and synthesized two nonfused ring electron acceptors, 412&#8208;6F and 412&#8208;6Cl, modified with fluorine and chlorine substituents, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that 412&#8208;6F possesses a planar molecular backbone and exhibits pronounced dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between the fluorine atoms on the lateral phenyl groups and the carbonyl oxygen atoms on the end groups. This specific interaction promotes dense end&#8208;group stacking, leading to a reduced interlayer spacing. Improved crystallinity and coherence length are observed in the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F blend film. Conversely, 412&#8208;6Cl adopts a more distorted configuration and lacks these interactions. As a result, the organic solar cell (OSC) based on D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6F achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, surpassing the performance of the D18&#8201;:&#8201;412&#8208;6Cl OSC. This underscores the importance of designing novel acceptors with beneficial intermolecular interactions to enhance OSC efficiency, thus providing a new direction for organic photovoltaic advancement.

         <title>Surficial Homogenic Effect Enables Highly Stable Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we innovatively proposed a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition technique to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer and perovskite surface by introducing the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T). Ultimately, we successfully fabricated efficient deep&#8208;blue device delivering the stable emission at 460&#8197;nm with enhanced EQE of 5.01&#8201;% with superior half&#8208;time of 31.3&#8197;min.







Abstract
The device performance of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep&#8208;blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition method to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs delivered an EQE exceeding 5&#8201;% (@ 460&#8197;nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.

Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep-blue PeLEDs delivered an EQE exceeding 5&#8201;% (@ 460&#8197;nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrapodal Hole&#8208;Collecting Monolayer Materials Based on Saddle&#8208;Like Cyclooctatetraene Core for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrapodal hole&#8208;collecting monolayer materials based on a saddle&#8208;like cyclooctatetraene core were developed. These molecules were found to form monolayers on transparent electrode substrates, with some phosphonic acid anchoring groups pointing upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. The perovskite solar cell devices using these hole&#8208;collecting monolayers exhibit high power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and good operational stability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI&#8208;C3 and 4PATTI&#8208;C4, by employing a saddle&#8208;like indole&#8208;fused cyclooctatetraene as a &#960;&#8208;core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI&#8208;C4 as the hole&#8208;collecting monolayer, 4PATTI&#8208;C3&#8208;based devices exhibit a faster hole&#8208;collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and 21.4&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;cell (0.1&#8197;cm2) and a mini&#8208;module (1.62&#8197;cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability. This work represents how structural modification of multipodal molecules could substantially modulate the functions of the hole&#8208;collecting monolayers after being adsorbed onto TCO substrates.

         <title>Precisely Regulating Asymmetric Charge Distribution by Single&#8208;Atom Central Doped Ag&#8208;Based Series Clusters for Enhanced Photoreduction of CO2 to Alcohol Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom central doped Ag&#8208;based series clusters (M1Ag24, M=Ag, Au, Pt) were introduced to precisely regulate the charge density of FePPc, in which Pt1Ag24 caused the most asymmetric charge distribution of Fe sites (followed by Au1Ag24 and Ag25), leading to the favorable CO2 adsorption and activation and showing enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with the methanol/ethanol yield of 48.55/32.97&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in H2O&#8208;CO2 system.







Abstract
High efficiently photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) into liquid fuels in pure water system remains challenged. Iron polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) with strong light harvesting, unique Fe&#8208;N4 structure, abundant pores, and good stability could serve as a promising catalyst for CO2 photoreduction. To further improve the catalytic efficiency, herein, symmetry&#8208;breaking Fe sites are constructed by coupling with atomically precise M1Ag24 (M=Ag, Au, Pt) series clusters. Especially, the introduction of Pt1Ag24 causes the most asymmetric charge distribution of Fe in FePPc (followed by Au1Ag24 and Ag25), leading to the favorable CO2 adsorption and activation. In addition, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc exhibits the most effective photogenerated carriers transfer and separation. As a result, Pt1Ag24&#8208;FePPc shows the methanol/ethanol yield of 48.55/32.97&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in H2O&#8208;CO2 system under visible light irradiation, ~1.65/1.25&#8208;fold, 1.83/1.37&#8208;fold, and 3.60/1.61&#8208;fold higher than that of Au1Ag24&#8208;FePPc, Ag25&#8208;FePPc, and FePPc, respectively. This work provides a concept for precisely construction and regulation symmetry&#8208;breaking sites of cluster&#8208;based catalysts for effective CO2 conversion.

         <title>Precisely Constructing Molecular Junctions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized using a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy to introduce CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation sites into the framework. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport, which achieves an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%).







Abstract
The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction&#8208;type porphyrin&#8208;based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP) was successfully self&#8208;assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single&#8208;component photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure&#8208;function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.

We have developed a room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method to synthesize highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks containing dual redox&#8208;active units. The synergistic effect of these units significantly reduces the redox energy barrier and improves the efficiency of neuromorphic computation.







Abstract
Organic memristors based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant potential for future neuromorphic computing applications. The preparation of high&#8208;quality COF nanosheets through appropriate structural design and building block selection is critical for the enhancement of memristor performance. In this study, a novel room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method was used to synthesize Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF, which contains two redox&#8208;active units: trinuclear copper and triphenylamine. The resultant COF nanosheets were dispersed through acid&#8208;assisted exfoliation and subsequently spin&#8208;coated to fabricate a high&#8208;quality COF film on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The synergistic effect of the dual redox&#8208;active centers in the COF film, combined with its distinct crystallinity, significantly reduces the redox energy barrier, enabling the efficient modulation of 128 non&#8208;volatile conductive states in the Al/Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF/ITO memristor. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on these 128 conductance states, image recognition for ten representative campus landmarks was successfully executed, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.13&#8201;% after 25 training epochs. Compared to devices based on binary conductance states, the memristor with 128 conductance states exhibits a 45.56&#8201;% improvement in recognition accuracy and significantly enhances the efficiency of neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Size Control and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Heteroleptic Pd3A3B3 and Pd4A4B4 Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;statistical multicomponent assembly gives simple synthetic access to the first Pd3A3B3 bowls, capable of showing guest&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Adjustment of ligand angle or backbone functionality allows control over the ring size, yielding Pd4A4B4 bowls or saddle&#8208;type structures.







Abstract
Two new structural motifs within the class of heteroleptic PdnAnBn assemblies, namely syn&#8208;cis&#8208;Pd3A3B3 bowls and bowl&#8208; (syn) or saddle&#8208; (anti) shaped cis&#8208;Pd4A4B4 rings are introduced. All of the ten examples share a common longer fluorenone&#8208;based bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, equipped with meta&#8208;pyridine donor groups. The ring size (3&#8208; vs. 4&#8208;membered) and conformational preference (bowl vs. saddle) are controlled by the choice of the shorter ligand. These carry para&#8208;pyridine donors, different aromatic backbones (benzene, thiophene or selenophene) and either no or small or bulky endohedral substituents, serving to control the nuclearity of the heteroleptic rings through different effects (ligand angle, charge distribution or backbone bulk). Moreover, the luminescence of the fluorenone ligand is conserved in the formed architectures. Emission intensity as well as host&#8211;guest properties vary depending on the inward&#8208;pointing functions. All Pd3A3B3 assemblies are shown to bind chiral guest BINOL bis&#8208;sulfonate which imparts its chirality to the entire host&#8211;guest complex. This results in a guest&#8208;induced circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor glum up to 10&#8722;3.

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>

         <dc:description>
New phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetanes bearing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with different electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs were shown to have an accelerated chemiexcitation and increased stability compared to previously reported 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe containing a six&#8208;member sulfone unit exhibited increased detection sensitivity toward &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expressing bacteria in growth medium.







Abstract
The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth medium. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by high&#8208;entropy concept, an multicomponent (MC) electrical double layer (EDL) structure is constructed by the addition of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions into electrolytes. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between these additives, the Zn|Cu half cell achieves a high average CE of 99.5&#8201;% with a high Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibits a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.







Abstract
Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter &#8211; a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement &#8211; was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5&#8201;% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3&#8201;%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our innovative unimolecular multiple&#8208;activatable photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) ingeniously integrates specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2.&#8722;/GSH into a single molecular platform, thereby enabling the simultaneous monitoring of NE activity and oxidative stress with minimal cross&#8208;reactivity, by modulating the photoinduced electron transfer and conjugation effect, respectively.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques. UMAPP, comprising a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, facilitates NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer impacting photoacoustic intensity at 685&#8197;nm (PA685). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction of catechol groups by O2&#8901;&#8722; and GSH induce reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum (PA745/PA685 ratio). Initial UMAPP applications successfully distinguished atherosclerotic and healthy mice, evaluated pneumonia&#8216;s effect on plaque composition and verified the probe&#8216;s effectiveness in drug&#8208;treatment studies by detecting molecular alterations before visible histopathological changes. The integrated molecular imaging capabilities of UMAPP offer promising advancements in atherosclerosis diagnosis and management, enabling early and accurate identification of vulnerable plaques.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens (hetero&#8208;POINT) has been developed to rationalize the design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. Immunological investigations reveal that the pattern of heterotypic antigen distribution yields distinct humoral and mucosal immune effects, highlighting the significance of the spatial placement of the antigens in structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/Paramagnetic Cobalt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of local gradient magnetic field&#8208;assisted in situ reconstruction is developed to directionally modulate the reconstruction of CoBDC in ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell precatalyst. The Kelvin force induced by gradient magnetic field can increase the proportion of divalent Co in the derived CoOxHy, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity compared to the reconstructed sample without gradient magnetic field assistance.







Abstract
The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128&#8201;% at 1.63&#8197;V and an overpotential reduction by 28&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100&#8197;h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison between the recently reported organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes and previously published direct methods display that his transformation does not establish a novel concept, but simply an addition to the portfolio of known reactions. Addition of mediators to our established direct electrolysis protocol and direct conversion of reported scope examples serve further to strengthen this statement.







Abstract
The recently reported electrochemical, organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes, a reaction referred to as &#8220;electrochemical deuterium atom transfer&#8221;, differs mechanistically from reported direct electrochemical hydrogenations/deuterations only by a mediated, homogeneous SET to the substrates. By comparing direct vs. mediated processes in general and for styrene reduction, we display that Qiu's work does not change the concept of this chemistry. Experiments with mediators and the direct reduction of examples from the reported scope show that even electron&#8208;rich substrates can be reduced when our direct protocol, published six months before Qiu's work, is applied.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2024)</title>

The dissolution&#8211;recrystallization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) opens exciting possibilities for fluorochromic detection of radionuclides. In their Research Article (e202410453), Jian Lin et al. introduce a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based MOFs. The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8211;recrystallization mechanism, transforming a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.

         <title>Cover Picture: Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/Non&#8208;Natural Building Blocks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying evolution to create bioactive molecules beyond natural building blocks (BBs) is crucial for chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the application of evolution with many different non&#8208;natural BBs remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202409746), Yixin Zhang, Fazheng Ren, Weilin Lin et&#8197;al. developed a programmable chemical evolution approach using natural/non&#8208;natural BBs. It starts from creating ancestral molecules, followed by evolving high&#8208;affinity peptidomimetic binders in just a few generations within an astronomically large combinatorial space.

Spatiotemporal operando Raman spectroscopy, combined with kinetic analysis under controlled chemical conditions, was employed to investigate the formation of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their kinetic impact during methane dry reforming on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, as reported by Matteo Monai, Matteo Maestri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408668). In the cover image, an increased CO2 content (depicted by the hot air balloon) relative to methane (represented by the basket) inhibits methane from leading to coke formation, symbolized by the mountains (Cover design: Lia Tagliavini).

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored molecular trap with optimal oxygen sites distribution is fabricated for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene isomers. Based on the specific molecular length recognition, simultaneous ultra&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) are achieved in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption.







Abstract
Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8211;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8722;C4H2O&#8722;CO2], featuring an effective pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.

         <title>From Cyclopropene to Housane Derivatives Via Intramolecular Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of housanes from cyclopropenes via highly strained intramolecular cyclopropanation is described. The reaction proceeds in synthetically useful yields and diastereoselectivity. Moreover, the application to the synthesis of unnatural housane&#8208;containing terpenoids is disclosed.







Abstract
The synthesis of housane derivatives from cyclopropenes is described. Under rhodium(II) catalysis, cyclopropenylvinyl carbinols can regioselectively generate a carbene intermediate which undergoes an intramolecular cyclopropanation to form a housane, a skeleton with similar ring strain as the cyclopropene precursor. The procedure shows a remarkable broad scope and efficiency. Moreover, the method served to prepare man&#8208;made housane&#8208;containing terpene derivatives, which are not accessible by Nature.

Two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium tellurides formulated as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)][(&#956;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#956;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] were reported. Both clusters possess low optical band gaps comparable to those of benchmark semiconductors and slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures. These co&#8208;existing properties qualify them as the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.







Abstract
Magnetic semiconductors, with integrated properties of ferromagnets and semiconductors, are significant for developing next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Herein two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium(III) tellurides, formulated respectively as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)2][(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 (Dy5Te6, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] (Dy6Te10), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single&#8208;molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.

Herein two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium(III) tellurides, formulated respectively as [Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(15-crown-5)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(py)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-Cp*Dy)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(Te)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;](py)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Dy&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2-cryptand)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-Cp*Dy)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Te)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Dy&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single-molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide-based molecular magnetic semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral homopropargylic alcohols affords cyclopentenes with a quaternary chiral center. A chiral binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl phosphine ligand featuring a distal phosphoryl group enables gold&#8208;ligand cooperation in this highly enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cyclization chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety&#8212;an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the substrate HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of enoate and ketone precursors. In addition to monocyclic cyclopentenes, spirocyclic and bicyclic ones are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.

         <title>Formation of a Decanuclear Organometallic Dysprosium Complex via a Radical&#8211;Radical Cross&#8211;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of pyrazine and allyl radicals led to the formation of a nanoscale decanuclear organometallic {Dy10} complex. This ring&#8208;like {Dy10} complex displays slow magnetic relaxation under a small applied field.







Abstract
Over the years, polynuclear cyclic or torus complexes have attracted increasing interest due to their unique metal topologies and properties. However, the isolation of polynuclear cyclic organometallic complexes is extremely challenging due to their inherent reactivity, which stems from the labile and reactive metal&#8208;carbon bonds. In this study, the pyrazine ligand undergoes a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction leading to the formation of a decanuclear [(Cp*)20Dy10(L1)10]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12(C7H8) (1; where L1 = anion of 2&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrazine; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complex, where all DyIII metal centres are bridged by the anionic L1 ligand. Amongst the family of polynuclear Ln organometallic complexes bearing CpR2Lnx units (CpR = substituted cyclopentadienyl), 1 features the highest nuclearity obtained to date. In&#8208;depth computational studies were conducted to elucidate the proposed reaction mechanism and formation of L1, while probing of the magnetic properties of 1, revealed slow magnetic relaxation upon application of a static dc field.

         <title>Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Single Crystals of A Three&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Covalent Framework Containing Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals of a chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid three&#8208;dimensional covalent framework (named CityU&#8208;22) were prepared, which is a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. CityU&#8208;22 shows good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat. CityU&#8208;22 also exhibits an ultraviolet nonlinear optical behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4. CityU&#8208;22 is the first chiral organic&#8211;inorganic covalent framework with a high SHG response.







Abstract
Extending covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into crystalline carbon&#8208;free covalent backbones is an important strategy to endow these materials with more exotic functions. Integrating metal&#8208;free inorganic and organic components into one covalent framework is an effective way to address the issue of poor thermal/solvent stability in the field of nonlinear optics (NLO). However, constructing such structures is very challenging. Here, we linked 3&#8208;connected nods (BO3) and 2&#8208;connected organic building blocks (Te(Ph)2) together to produce colorless single crystals (size up to 400&#8197;&#956;m) of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral covalent framework (CityU&#8208;22). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that CityU&#8208;22 has a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. The chiral CityU&#8208;22 displays good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat (the decomposition temperature above 300&#8201;&#176;C). Due to its non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone (&#8722;Te&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8722;O&#8722;), CityU&#8208;22 shows an ultraviolet NLO behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4 (KDP).

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of redox&#8208;active bipyridinium ligands into spin crossover active metal organic frameworks leads to void spaces reminiscent of the &#8216;little blue box&#8217;. The inclusion of a &#960;&#8208;electron rich aromatic guest molecule causes a single crystal to single crystal transformation and guest&#8208;induced spin transition. Therefore, this work inspires the spin state control of these systems through the application of (photo&#8208;)electrical stimuli.







Abstract
Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.

The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor-acceptor &#960;-&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature-dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Ether Lipid Synthesis by an Archaeal Glycerolprenylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Remarkably, it does so through carbocation&#8208;type chemistry in a fully solvent&#8208;exposed active site.







Abstract
Although ethers are common in secondary natural products, they are an underrepresented functional group in primary metabolism. As such, there are comparably few enzymes capable of constructing ether bonds in a general fashion. However, such enzymes are highly sought after for synthetic applications as they typically operate with higher regioselectivity and under milder conditions than traditional organochemical approaches. To expand the repertoire of well characterized ether synthases, we herein report on a promiscuous archaeal prenyltransferase from the scarcely researched family of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthases (GGGPSs or G3PSs). We show that the ultrastable Archaeoglobus fulgidus G3PS makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Based on experimental and computational data, we propose a mechanism for this enzyme which involves an intermediary prenyl carbocation equivalent. As such, this study provides the fundamental understanding and methods to introduce G3PSs into the biocatalytic alkylation toolbox.

         <title>Cascade Effect of a Dimerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dendrimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule with an improved horizontal emitting dipole orientation, fast reverse intersystem crossing, and high photoluminescence quantum yield in a pristine film was constructed. The solution&#8208;processable non&#8208;doped device and the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibited maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.6&#8201;% and 30.7&#8201;%, respectively, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with a high horizontal orientation are highly essential for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes; however, pivotal molecular design strategies to improve the horizontal orientation of solution&#8208;processable TADF emitters are still scarce and challenging. Herein, a phenyl bridge is adopted to connect the double TADF units, and generate a dimerized TADF dendrimer, D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF. Compared to its counterpart with a single TADF unit, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule not only exhibits an improved horizontal dipole ratio (78&#8201;%) due to the &#960;&#8208;delocalization&#8208;induced extended molecular conjugation, but also displays a faster reversed intersystem crossing rate constant (6.08&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95&#8201;% in neat film. Consequently, the non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed device with D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as the emitter achieves an ultra&#8208;high maximum EQE of 32.6&#8201;%, which remains at 26.6&#8201;% under a luminance of 1000 cd/m2. Furthermore, when using D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as a sensitizer, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibits a high maximum EQE of 30.7&#8201;% at a luminance of 575&#8197;cd/m2 and a full width at half maximum of 36&#8197;nm.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Ordering in A One&#8208;Dimensional Organic Copper Chloride Hybrid Insulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) organic metal halide hybrid, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6, has been synthesized and characterized for the first time, which exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. This work paves novel pathways for developing functional low&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids for spintronics.







Abstract
Low dimensional (LD) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as new generation functional materials with exceptional structural and property tunability. Despite the remarkable advances in the development of LD OMHHs, optical properties have been the major functionality extensively investigated for most of LD OMHHs developed to date, while other properties, such as magnetic and electronic properties, remain significantly under&#8208;explored. Here, we report for the first time the characterization of the magnetic and electronic properties of a 1D OMHH, organic&#8208;copper (II) chloride hybrid (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6. Owing to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu atoms through chloride bridges in 1D [Cu2Cl62&#8722;]&#8734; chains, (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 is found to exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with a N&#233;el temperature of 24&#8197;K. The two&#8208;terminal (2T) electrical measurement on a (C8H22N2)Cu2Cl6 single crystal reveals its insulating nature. This work shows the potential of LD OMHHs as a highly tunable quantum material platform for spintronics.

         <title>Copper Intercalation Induces Amorphization of 2D Cu/WO3 for Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was achieved for a Cu intercalated, amorphous 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the magnetic enhancement of 2D Cu/WO3 is originated from oxygen lattice distortion induced by Cu intercalation, leading to the formation of bound magnetic polaron for ferromagnetism.







Abstract
Ferromagnetism in the two&#8208;dimensional limit has become an intriguing topic for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications. To induce ferromagnetism in 2D materials, intercalation has been proposed to be an effective strategy, which could introduce lattice distortion and unpaired spin into the material to modulate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. To strengthen the understanding of the magnetic origin of 2D material, Cu was introduced into a 2D WO3 through chemical intercalation in this work (2D Cu/WO3). In contrast to the diamagnetic nature of Cu and WO3, room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was characterized for 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical results attribute the ferromagnetism to the bound magnetic polaron in 2D Cu/WO3, which is consist of unpaired spins from W5+/W4+ with localized carriers from oxygen vacancies. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to introduce ferromagnetism into diamagnetic WO3, which could be applied for a wider scope of 2D materials.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Metastable Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes with Tunable Threading Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planetary centrifugal mixing was the key to the rapid and convenient synthesis of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs). The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction served as the end&#8208;capping reaction using glutathione (GSH) to prepare metastable PRs. The GSH stoppers prevent de&#8208;threading at room temperature, such that heating controls the de&#8208;threading rate, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyrotaxanes (CD&#8208;PRs) are gaining attention for their dynamic sliding rings along the polymer axis, enabling various applications in molecular shuttles, drug delivery, and durable polymers with slidable cross&#8208;links. However, the conventional synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs with tunable threading ratios is typically laborious, time&#8208;consuming, and complicated, which limits their scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we highlight the great potential of planetary centrifugal mixing, a process that significantly accelerates and simplifies the initial synthesis of polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs), followed by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction as an efficient end&#8208;capping reaction for the synthesis of PRs. Notably, PRs synthesized with glutathione (GSH) as the end&#8208;capping reagent are in a metastable state, where GSH act as a molecular bumper that significantly prevent de&#8208;threading of &#945;&#8208;CD rings at room temperature. Moreover, the rate of ring de&#8208;threading can be precisely controlled by heating, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range. The developed strategy is of great significance to the efficient synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs, thus marking a significant step towards their practical application in advanced functional materials and devices.

         <title>Integration of Perylene Diimide into a Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework based on perylene diimide (PDI&#8208;PDA) has been synthesized and characterized. Its photocatalytic efficiency in thioether oxidation to sulfoxide compounds was more than ten&#8208;fold higher than that of PDI&#8208;PH. The enhanced electron&#8208;induced O2 activation under visible light was due to improved charge separation and transfer.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs) have garnered considerable attention due to their immense potential in photocatalysis. However, manipulating the molecular packing within their aggregates and enhancing the efficiency of photogenerated carrier recombination remain significant challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the incorporation of a PDI unit into a covalent organic framework (COF), named PDI&#8208;PDA, by linking an ortho&#8208;substituted PDI with p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA) to control its intermolecular aggregation. The incorporation enables precise modulation of electron&#8208;transfer dynamics, leading to a ten&#8208;fold increase in the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide with PDI&#8208;PDA compared to the PDI molecular counterpart, with yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. Electron property studies and density functional theory calculations show that the PDI&#8208;PDA with its well&#8208;defined crystal structure, enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lowers the electron transition barrier. Moreover, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the PDI unit promotes the spatial separation of the valency band maximum and conduction band minimum of PDI&#8208;PDA, suppressing the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and improving the charge&#8208;separation efficiency to give high photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a brief but effective way for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of commonly used PDI&#8208;based dyes by integrating them into a framework skeleton.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization for Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy was utilized to rapidly prepare electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films at room temperature, which exhibited stable polymorphic electrochromic properties. Additionally, the electrochromic behavior of COFs films at negative potentials can be regulated by uranium, demonstrating the unique color tunability of COFs.







Abstract
A rapid in situ synthesis of electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (EC&#8208;COFs) was proposed by using green electrochemical interface polymerization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine (TPDA) and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde (DHBD). The synthetized TPDA&#8208;DHBD films exhibit stable polymorphic color variations under different applied potentials, which can be attributed to the redox state changes of bis(triphenylamine) and imine electroactive functional groups within the COFs skeleton. TPDA&#8208;DHBD represents markedly different electrochromisms from red to cyan due to the steric hindrance effect caused by the presence of UO22+, demonstrating the unique tunability of COFs materials. This work offers a new feasible idea for rapid EC&#8208;COFs synthesis and tunable EC&#8208;COFs realization.

         <title>Methoxide&#8208;Enabled Zirconium&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the zirconium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkenes is presented that allows the direct use of zirconocene dichloride as catalyst through mild activation with a methoxide additive. The reaction can be applied to terminal, internal, and conjugated alkenes. A catalytic zirconium walk ensures the selective formation of linear silane products. Based on additional experiments and calculations, a zirconium(IV) mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
A zirconocene dichloride&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation is reported that can be applied to non&#8208;activated and conjugated terminal and internal alkenes. It involves a catalytic Zr&#8208;walk process and leads to a selective conversion to the linear product. Lithium methoxide serves as mild catalyst activating agent, which significantly increases the applicability and operational simplicity in comparison to earlier zirconium(II)&#8208;based protocols. Supported by additional experiments and calculations, a mechanism via zirconium(IV) intermediates is proposed. Due to the benign nature and ready&#8208;availability of the zirconium catalyst, the reaction is an attractive alternative to established alkene hydrosilylation methods.

         <title>Thermotropic &#8220;Plumber's Nightmare&#8221;&#8212;A Tight Liquid Organic Double Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A most common cubic phase in lyotropic (surfactant&#8208;water) systems, the &#8220;plumber's nightmare&#8221; labyrinth, has never been found in thermotropic liquid crystals. Here the first example is reported. Intriguingly, removal of just a methyl branch from the fluorescent mesogen's six alkyls converts the double&#8208;network cubic into an array of counter&#8208;twisting helices.







Abstract
Gyroid, double diamond and the body&#8208;centred &#8220;Plumber's nightmare&#8221; are the three most common bicontinuous cubic phases in lyotropic liquid crystals and block copolymers. While the first two are also present in solvent&#8208;free thermotropics, the latter had never been found. Containing six&#8208;fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod&#8208;like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side&#8208;branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side&#8208;chains should be very short. The true Plumber's nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod&#8208;like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end&#8208;chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework&#8208;forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry&#8208;based explanation is given.

Containing six-fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod-like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side-branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side-chains should be very short. The true Plumber's nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod-like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end-chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework-forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry-based explanation is given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One Iron for Two Iron Sites in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward Simultaneous N2&#8722;H2 Activation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron site in a metal&#8211;organic framework skeleton was introduced as an activator for the two types of iron sites in Fe3O4. Integration of these three kinds of iron sites in one catalytic system exhibited a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; effect, which played the roles in nitrogen activation, hydrogen activation and products transfer simultaneously, and hydrogenation of nitrogen to ammonia was achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts play an important role in the ammonia industry. As one of the most abundant iron minerals, Fe3O4 containing FeII and FeIII sites is widely distributed in the earth's crust and even on exoplanets, theoretically giving it both economic and catalytic potentials in ammonia synthesis. However, in the absence of specific active co&#8208;catalyst and harsh conditions, Fe3O4 is impossible to achieve ammonia synthesis alone. Here, we designed to activate the relatively inert FeII and FeIII sites in Fe3O4 with a third FeIII site inlayed in a coordination framework (MIL&#8208;101(Fe)) to achieve the unpresented multi&#8208;site collaborative catalysis. In&#8208;depth mechanism study confirmed the roles of three different Fe sites in N2 activation, H2 activation, and product transfer, respectively. Efficient N2&#8722;H2 activation to NH3 on the Fe3O4&#8208;based catalytic system has been achieved at extremely mild conditions. Our research provides a theoretical basis and a new strategy for designing efficient non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based ammonia synthesis catalyst with minimized energy consumption.

         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation and hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, enabling highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactones as well as &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in a Photostable Ion&#8208;Paired Yb&#8722;Eu Heteronuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 46, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upconversion emission of Eu3+ was achieved in a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] and the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified. In addition, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 of 420&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes have potential application in diverse fields and attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, the similar coordination reactivity of lanthanide ions has constrained the designability of target molecule with well&#8208;defined structure, and many attempts obtained statistical mixtures. Herein, an ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] (TpPy=tris[3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl]hydroborate, ND=3&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridin&#8208;4&#8208;olate) was designed and synthesized. Thanks to the radius difference between Eu3+ (1.07&#8197;&#197;) and Yb3+ (0.98&#8197;&#197;) ions, the hexadentate TpPy ligand was selected to coordinate with Eu3+ and the Yb3+ with a smaller radius was chelated by bidentate ND ligand. As a result, the sites of Eu3+ and Yb3+ in the complex can be clarified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis. Upon the excitation of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm, the upconversion emission of Eu3+ was realized through a cooperative sensitization process. Furthermore, [Eu(TpPy)2][Yb(ND)4] demonstrated excellent photostability during continuous high&#8208;power density 980&#8197;nm laser irradiation, with a LT95 (the time to 95&#8201;% of the initial emission intensity) of 420&#8197;minutes. This work provides the first example of a pure ion&#8208;paired Yb&#8722;Eu heteronuclear complex upconversion system and may bring insights into rational design of lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion molecular complexes.
