         <title>Selective Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Azaarenes and Alkynes via Photoredox Cobalt Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light&#8208;induced Co&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed. Notably, H&#252;nig&#8217;s base together with simple ethanol has been successfully applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this catalytic photoredox reaction. This approach has considerable advantages for the straightforward synthesis of stereodefined multiple substituted alkenes bearing an azaarene motif, such as excellent regioselectivity (&gt;20:1 for &gt;30 examples) and stereoselectivity (&gt;20:1  E  /  Z  ), broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility under mild reaction conditions, which has been utilized in the concise synthesis of natural product monomorine I. A reasonable catalytic reaction pathway involving protolysis of the cobaltacyclopentene intermediate has been proposed based on the mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of CuMn Prussian Blue Analog Double&#8208;shelled Nanoboxes Toward Long&#8208;life Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to their unique open&#8208;framework structures. However, they suffer from limited capacity and severe capacity decay originating from insufficient redox sites and structural instability. Herein, Cu&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;PBA double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes (CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs) prepared by tannic acid etching and cation exchange approaches are demonstrated for efficient Zn ion storage. The unique hollow structures can expose abundant active sites and alleviate the volume change during the cycling test. Moreover, partial Cu substitution and induced Mn vacancies might inhibit the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions of Mn&#8208;N  6  octahedra, thus contributing to the prolonged lifespan. As a result, CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs exhibit high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability for 2000 cycles. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage mechanism of CuMn&#8208;PBA DSNBs mainly involves the reversible redox reactions of transition metals and Zn  2+  ion insertion/extraction processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Persistent Production of Reactive Oxygen Species during the Degradation of Black Phosphorous in the Darkness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FLBP) is easily degraded under ambient condition which  is an important barrier that plagues the application of FLBP, but its degradation mechanism is not yet well understood. In this work, we surprisingly found the persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was involved with FLBP  degradation  process even in the dark, and ROS generation patterns and mechanism was revealed by  chemiluminescence (CL) and density functional theory (DFT)  . Meanwhile, rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) can also be removed by FLBP under dark conditions, which further evidence the ROS generation during FLBP self&#8208;degradation. This work provides new insights into FLBP self&#8208;degradation mechanism and opens opportunities to practically implement FLBP for green catalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;propelled magnetic dendrite&#8208;shaped microrobots for photodynamic prostate cancer therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic micromotors that exhibit wireless and controllable motion by light have been extensively explored for cancer treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment can down&#8208;regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level for cancer therapy. Herein, we present dendrite&#8208;shaped light&#8208;powered hematite microrobots as an effective GSH depletion agent&#160;for PDT of prostate cancer cells. These hematite microrobots can display negative phototactic motion under light irradiation and flexible actuation in a defined path controlled by an external magnetic field. Non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized cells can be achieved by manipulating the microrobot&#8217;s motion. In addition, the biocompatible microrobots induce GSH depletion and greatly enhance PDT performance. The proposed dendrite&#8208;shaped hematite microrobots contribute to developing dual light/magnetic field&#8208;powered micromachines for the biomedical field.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Based Organic Crystals with Distinct Conformers Enabling Wide&#8208;Range Excitation&#8208;Dependent Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and generalizable molecular platform that exhibits three emission bands in the crystalline states. The emission maximum can be tuned over a wide range (&#8819;230&#8197;nm) by varying excitation wavelengths. Diverse conformations in S0 and three local minima in S1 are crucial to these unique luminescent properties.







Abstract
Achieving wide&#8208;range tunable emission colors, especially in the solid state of single&#8208;fluorophore materials, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a molecular design strategy that affords wide&#8208;range excitation&#8208;dependent emissions spanning over &#8776;230&#8197;nm in crystalline states. Under the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration, we judiciously choose a rotatable acceptor fragment, o&#8208;carborane, to enrich conformational diversities in the crystalline state and generate conformation&#8208;dependent multicolor emissions. We further show that this molecular platform is generalizable in creating crystalline materials with multicolor emissions. Based on these materials, a high&#8208;capacity information storage device and a finite&#8208;state machine were fabricated to showcase multicolor displays and information storage.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Functional Evaluation of IORs, Sulfonolipid&#8208;based Inhibitors of Cell Differentiation in Salpingoeca rosetta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and modular synthesis of the rosette&#8208;inhibitor sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A and chemical probes was achieved via decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a desymmetrized tartaric acid derivatives and alkyl zinc reagents of choice. Synthesized congeners and bifunctional probes allowed to determine structure&#8208;activity relation to profile binding partners in producer and recipient for the first time.







Abstract
The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A (six steps, 27&#8201;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in S.&#8197;rosetta. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid&#8208;containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR&#8208;1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity&#8208;based probes, allowed quantification of IOR&#8208;1A, localization studies within S.&#8197;rosetta cells, and evaluation of structure&#8208;activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and S.&#8197;rosetta. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within S.&#8197;rosetta.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choanoflagellate &lt;i&gt;Salpingoeca rosetta&lt;/i&gt; is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR-1A (six steps, 27&#8201;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt;. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid-containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR-1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity-based probes, allowed quantification of IOR-1A, localization studies within &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt; cells, and evaluation of structure-activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt;. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within &lt;i&gt;S.&#8197;rosetta&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated and Robust Superhydrophobic Modification on Covalent Organic Framework for Crude&#8208;Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schiff base condensation and 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions are used to develop and decorate a new covalent organic framework (COF) to associate superhydrophobicity, that performs at severe settings. The embedded superhydrophobicity was used for cleaning oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, irrespective of nature of selected oils and used surfactants.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) having high specific surface area, tunable pore size and high crystallinity are mostly post modified following fluorine&#8208;based and complex synthetic approaches to achieve a bio&#8208;inspired liquid wettability, i.e. superhydrophobicity. Herein, a facile, non&#8208;fluorinated and robust chemical approach is introduced for tailoring the water wettability of a new COF&#8212;which was prepared through Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. A silane precursor was readily reacted with selected alkyl acrylates through 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction, prior to grafting on the prepared C4&#8208;COF for tailoring different water wettability&#8212;including robust superhydrophobicity. The superhydrophobic C4&#8208;COF (SH&#8208;C4&#8208;COF) that displayed significantly enhanced (&gt;5&#8197;times; from 220&#8197;wt.&#8201;% to 1156&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) oil&#8208;absorption capacity, was extended to address the relevant challenges of &#8220;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8221; emulsion separation, rapidly (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitively (50&#8197;times) at diverse and harsh conditions.

         <title>Synergistic Charge Percolation in Conducting Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance In Vivo Sensing of Neurochemical and Neuroelectrical Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal approach that endows conducting polymer (PEDOT:PSS)&#8208;based fiber&#8208;microsensors with an interiorly constructed synergistic charge percolation highway for (i)&#8197;selective and sensitive sensing of a target neurochemical (vitamin C) and (ii)&#8197;high&#8208;fidelity sensing of neuronal activities. This strategy is validated through in vivo applications in the nervous system.







Abstract
Challenges remain in establishing a universal method to precisely tune electrochemical properties of conducting polymers for multifunctional neurosensing with high selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a facile and general approach to achieving synergistic charge percolation in conducting polymers (i.e., poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) by incorporating conductive catalysts (i.e., carbon nanotubes, CNTs) and post&#8208;processing. The approach shows synergistic effects: (i)&#8197;CNTs and post&#8208;processing together promote PEDOT ordered interconnection for highly efficient charge percolation that accelerates electrochemical kinetics; (ii)&#8197;CNTs catalyze the electrooxidation of vitamin C for selective electrochemical sensing; (iii)&#8197;CNTs enhance the charge storage/injection capacity of PEDOT:PSS. The prepared CNT&#8208;PEDOT:PSS fiber mechanically matches with neural tissues and is proved to be a biocompatible versatile microsensor capable of high&#8208;performance neurosensing in vivo.

Abstract
We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;&#8208;alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. 2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;9&#8208;anthracenyl&#8208;substituted chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;&#8208;vinyl substituted allylic boronate gave alcohols with R absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with S absolute configuration. Unusual substrate&#8208;catalyst C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the favoured reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence through DFT computational studies.

         <title>Dehydrogenation of Ammonia Borane by Platinum&#8208;Nickel Dimers: Regulation of Heteroatom Interspace Boosts Bifunctional Synergetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt1Ni1/C3N4 dimeric catalyst exhibits a much higher activity than Pt1/C3N4 in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane for hydrogen generation. A bifunctional synergy is revealed in which the bridging OH in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers promotes H2O dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of the B&#8722;H bond, thus cooperatively accelerating hydrogen production.







Abstract
Regulation of the atom&#8208;atom interspaces of dual&#8208;atom catalysts is essential to optimize the dual&#8208;atom synergy to achieve high activity but remains challenging. Herein, we report an effective strategy to regulate the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace to achieve Pt1Ni1 dimers and Pt1+Ni1 heteronuclear dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (HDSACs) by tailoring steric hindrance between metal precursors during synthesis. Spectroscopic characterization reveals obvious electron transfers in Pt1Ni1 oxo dimers but not in Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB), the H2 formation rates show an inverse proportion to the Pt1&#8208;Ni1 interspace. The rate of Pt1Ni1 dimers is &#8776;13 and 2&#8197;times higher than those of Pt1 and Pt1+Ni1 HDSAC, manifesting the interspace&#8208;dependent synergy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the bridging OH group in Pt1Ni1 dimers promotes water dissociation, while Pt1 facilitates the cleavage of B&#8722;H bonds in AB, which boosts a bifunctional synergy to accelerate H2 production cooperatively.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Ester Electrolyte with Boosted Stability Against Li for High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with NO3&#8722; readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath that reduces the polarity of solvent and therefore boosts the stability of electrolyte against Li metal. The electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The Li plating/stripping reversibility in Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;%.







Abstract
In traditional non&#8208;flammable electrolytes a trade&#8208;off always exists between non&#8208;flammability and battery performance. Previous research focused on reducing free solvents and forming anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. However, the contribution of solvated anions in boosting the stability of electrolyte has been overlooked. Here, we resolve this via introducing anions into Li+ solvation sheaths using anions with similar Gutmann donor number (DN) to that of solvents. Taking trimethyl phosphate fire&#8208;retardant (DN=23.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (DN=22.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as an example, NO3&#8722; is readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath and reduces the polarity of solvent. This results in boosted stability of electrolyte against Li. The developed non&#8208;flammable electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The reversibility of Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;% and the lifespan of practical LMBs was extended by &gt;100&#8201;%.

         <title>On Demand Flow Platform for the Generation of Anhydrous Dinitrogen Trioxide and Its Further Use in N&#8208;Nitrosative Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

A versatile continuous flow platform for the generation of concentrated dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) solution with accurate and tunable concentration is reported. It unlocks the use of N2O3 in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles in flow and batch.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N2O3 is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open&#8208;source setup and procedure for the on&#8208;demand generation of anhydrous N2O3 solution (up to 1&#8197;M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N2O3 concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head&#8208;space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles&#8212;a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the N&#8208;nitrosative steps are also explored.

         <title>Visualization of Protein&#8208;Specific Glycation in Living Cells via Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a strategy for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation based on bioorthogonal chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout, which provide a powerful tool for analysing protein glycation and their corresponding biological functions in living cells.







Abstract
Due to the lack of suitable chemical tools, probing the protein&#8208;specific glycation is highly challenging. Herein, we present a strategy based on glycation chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation in living cells. We first developed a bioorthogonal glucose analogue, 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (6AzGlc), as a novel glycation chemical reporter. Two types of DNA probes, glycation conversion probe and protein targeting probe, were designed to attach to glycation adducts and target proteins, respectively. After the protein was glycated by 6AzGlc, two DNA probes were sequentially applied to the target protein, triggering proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout. This strategy was successfully used to visualize glucose glycation of several proteins, including PD&#8208;L1 and integrin. More importantly, this strategy allowed us to analyze corresponding biological functions of glycated protein in the native environment.

         <title>Missing&#8208;linker Defects in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>

The defect engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of facilitated transport covalent organic framework membranes with missing&#8208;linker defects for efficient CO2 separation.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ordered channels and free organic groups hold great promise in molecular separations owing to the synergy of physical and chemical microenvironments. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to fabricate COF membranes for efficient CO2 separation. Abundant amino groups are in situ generated on the COF nanosheets arising from the missing&#8208;linker defects during the reactive assembly of amine monomer and mixed aldehyde monomers. The COF nanosheets are assembled to fabricate COF membranes. Amino groups, as the CO2 facilitated transport carriers, along with ordered channels endow COF membrane with high CO2 permeances exceeding 300&#8197;GPU and excellent separation selectivity of 80 for CO2/N2, and 54 for CO2/CH4 mixed gas under humidified state. Our defect engineering strategy offers a facile approach to generating free organic functional groups in COF membranes and other organic framework membranes for diverse chemical separations.

A &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer, containing both a furan&#8208;protected maleimide (FMI) monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. Due to the dynamic nature of the r&#8208;DA reaction of FMI, the release of maleimide (MI) and the subsequent copolymerization of MI can be regulated by tuning the temperature and stereochemistry during its SCVCP.







Abstract
An efficient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer (LI&#8208;Br), containing a furan&#8208;protected maleimide monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. At high temperatures, the &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer is converted to a &#8220;real&#8221; inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (r&#8208;DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the r&#8208;DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star&#8208;shaped and long&#8208;chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;one-pot&#8221; strategy for the structure-controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer, containing both a furan-protected maleimide (FMI) monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. Due to the dynamic nature of the &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-DA reaction of FMI, the release of maleimide (MI) and the subsequent copolymerization of MI can be regulated by tuning the temperature and stereochemistry during its SCVCP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient &#8220;one-pot&#8221; strategy for the structure-controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer (&lt;b&gt;LI-Br&lt;/b&gt;), containing a furan-protected maleimide monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. At high temperatures, the &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer is converted to a &#8220;real&#8221; inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a &lt;i&gt;retro&lt;/i&gt;-Diels&#8211;Alder (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self-condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one-pot&#8221; structure-controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star-shaped and long-chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Initiated Synthesis of Methanesulfonic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methanesulfonic acid was achieved from only methane and oleum in an electrochemical reactor. At the boron&#8208;doped diamond anode the species is formed, which initiates the catalytic cycle where methane is selectively sulfonated to the product. A concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) was achieved at 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The direct sulfonation of methane to methanesulfonic acid was achieved in an electrochemical reactor without adding peroxide initiators. The synthesis proceeds only from oleum and methane. This is possible due to in situ formation of an initiating species from the electrolyte at a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode. Elevated pressure, moderate temperature and suitable current density are beneficial to reach high concentration at outstanding selectivity. The highest concentration of 3.7&#8197;M (approximately 62&#8201;% yield) at 97&#8201;% selectivity was reached with a stepped electric current program at 6.25&#8211;12.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 70&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8197;bar methane pressure in 22&#8197;hours. We present a novel, electrochemical method to produce methanesulfonic acid, propose a reaction mechanism and show general dependencies between parameters and yields for methanesulfonic acid.

         <title>Olefin&#8211;Borane Interactions in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Fluorophores that Undergo Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pair&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin&#8211;borane interaction can be used to modulate the electron&#8208;accepting ability of boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores with alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl groups exhibit response even to a bulky Lewis base through a frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP)&#8208;type addition. Reversible association/dissociation behavior of the adduct is observed in response to temperature over a range above ambient temperature.







Abstract
Olefin&#8211;borane &#960;&#8208;complexes have been postulated as intermediates for the addition of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to olefins. In the present study, we have employed this weak interaction to modulate the electronic properties of boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. A series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorophores that contain an alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl group is synthesized. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the olefin and boron moieties are held in close proximity. Upon addition of a Lewis base to a solution of these D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A fluorophores, an FLP&#8208;type addition occurs with concurrent significant changes in the absorption and emission properties. The FLP&#8208;type reaction shifts the reaction site from the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron atom to a carbocationic center, and thereby even facilitates a reaction with bulky Lewis bases. For example, a tricyclohexylphosphine adduct thus generated exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent reversible dissociation/association behavior. These results provide a design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive emissive boron&#8208;based materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) from binary to high&#8208;entropy was fabricated by a facile coprecipitation method. When used as sulfur hosts, high&#8208;entropy PBA can act as polysulfide immobilizers and catalysts to achieve high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Moreover, metal oxides derived from high&#8208;entropy PBA possess good electronic properties, which can prompt the further research of high&#8208;entropy PBA derivatives.







Abstract
The introduction of high&#8208;entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery materials. Herein, we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high&#8208;entropy by a facile coprecipitation method. The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate that high&#8208;entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance. Additionally, a variety of nanocubic metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our coprecipitation and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nitric Oxide for Biomedical Applications</title>

An electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (Fe SAC) is developed for high&#8208;efficient and controlled generation of nitric oxide (NO). The effectiveness of NO generation system underscores a great promise to expedite NO research in both therapeutic and mechanistic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) constitutes one of the most versatile therapeutics for biomedical applications. The efficient and on&#8208;demand NO generation essentially dictates its concentration dependent therapeutic activity. Here, we report an electrochemical system employing a rationally designed single&#8208;iron atom based biomimetic catalyst (i.e., Fe SAC), for high&#8208;efficient and controlled NO generation. The Fe SAC shows superior catalytic ability in electrochemical reduction of nitrite, with maximal NO generation rate achieving 2.1&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;(min&#8201;&#956;g)&#8722;1. Theoretical studies suggest the significant decrease of Gibbs&#8208;free energy of NO2&#8722; adsorption on single&#8208;iron atom accounts for its high catalytic efficiency. Moreover, ample amount of NO can be controllably generated in a potential dependent manner. For antibacterial application, the generated NO overwhelmingly disrupts both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive strains, highlighting a great promise to expedite NO research in both basic and applied sciences.

         <title>Strong Anharmonicity&#8208;Induced Low Thermal Conductivity and High n&#8208;type Mobility in the Topological Insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low lattice thermal conductivity and high electron mobility provide promising thermoelectric performance in a 3D topological insulator, Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S. The low thermal conductivity originates from the strong anharmonicity, while the high carrier mobility results from metallic suface states in the topological insulator.







Abstract
Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&#956;) is of the utmost importance for thermoelectrics. Topological insulators (TI) can possess high &#956; due to the metallic surface states. TIs with heavy constituents and layered structure can give rise to high anharmonicity and are expected to show low &#954;lat. Here, we demonstrate that Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (BSTS), which is a 3D bulk TI, exhibits ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat of 0.46&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 along with high &#956; of &#8776;401&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Sound velocity measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that chemical bonding hierarchy and high anharmonicity play a crucial role behind such ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. BSTS possesses low energy optical phonons which strongly couple with the heat carrying acoustic phonons leading to ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. Further, Cl has been doped at the S site of BSTS which increases the electron concentration and reduces the &#954;lat resulting in a promising n&#8208;type thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8776;0.6 at 573&#8197;K.

         <title>High&#8208;Power Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous All Organic Redox Flow Battery Enabled with a Pair of Anionic Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) operating upon a pair of judiciously designed anionic viologen and TEMPO derivatives, endows the near&#8208;neutral electrolyte systems with compatibility to the cation&#8208;exchange membrane (CEM), high cell voltage, excellent cycling stability and record&#8208;high power density.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are regarded as a promising alternative for low&#8208;cost and durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the narrow potential gap, chemical lability and membrane fouling in most AORFBs constitute formidable roadblocks for practical applications. Herein, a pair of anionic organic molecules, namely (PPBPy)Br2 and PSS&#8208;TEMPO, are proposed. The (PPBPy)Br2 in anolyte reveals remarkable electrochemical stability without degradation after 1000&#8197;cycles, while PSS&#8208;TEMPO in catholyte presents a capacity decay rate as low as 0.012&#8201;%/cycle. At near&#8208;neutral conditions, the (PPBPy)Br2/PSS&#8208;TEMPO flow cell exhibits a high voltage of 1.61&#8197;V, extremely low permeability across cation&#8208;exchange membrane and thus excellent cycling stability. Notably, a highest peak power density of 509&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been achieved among reported all&#8208;organic aqueous RFBs. The molecular engineering strategies demonstrated here could provide a credible example of high&#8208;performance AORFBs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Lead Against Acinetobacter baumannii 17978</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Sixteen oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharide of A. baumannii 17978 are the basis for serum and antibody screening to identify a vaccine lead.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is a opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for serious nosocomial infections that is becoming increasingly resistant against antibiotics. Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that cover A. baumannii are a major virulence factor that play an important role in pathogenesis, are used to assign serotypes and provide the basis for vaccine development. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of A. baumannii 17978 were printed onto microarray slides and used to screen sera from patients infected with A. baumannii as well as a monoclonal mouse antibody (mAb C8). A synthetic oligosaccharide emerged from glycan array screening as lead for the development of a vaccine against A. baumannii 17978. Tetrasaccharide 20 is a key epitope for recognition by an antibody and is a vaccine lead.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Circulating Vector for Aptamers Based upon Polyphosphodiester&#8208;Backboned Molecular Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottlebrush polymer&#8208;aptamer biohybrid, termed PSP pacDNA, is prepared using solid&#8208;phase and graft&#8208;onto methodologies. Consisting of a polyphosphodiester backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains, the PSP pacDNA suppresses non&#8208;specific interactions with the cell and improves the plasma pharmacokinetics of the aptamer. Combined with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer, the PSP pacDNA produces a pronounced anticoagulation effect in vivo.







Abstract
Aptamers face challenges for use outside the ideal conditions in which they are developed. These difficulties are most palpable in vivo due to nuclease activities, rapid clearance, and off&#8208;target binding. Herein, we demonstrate that a polyphosphodiester&#8208;backboned molecular brush can suppress enzymatic digestion, reduce non&#8208;specific cell uptake, enable long blood circulation, and rescue the bioactivity of a conjugated aptamer in vivo. The backbone along with the aptamer is assembled via solid&#8208;phase synthesis, followed by installation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains using a two&#8208;step process with near&#8208;quantitative efficiency. The synthesis allows for precise control over polymer size and architecture. Consisting entirely of building blocks that are generally recognized as safe for therapeutics, this novel molecular brush is expected to provide a highly translatable route for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Programming and Dynamic Control of the Circular Polarization of Luminescence from an Achiral Fluorescent Dye in a Liquid Crystal Host by Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

MCELDs (Molecular&#8208;machine&#8208;based CPL&#8208;emitting LC devices) are prepared by mixing molecular motors and BODIPYs in liquid crystal mixtures. This system shows robust CPL switching, orthogonal excitation on molecular motors and fluorescent dyes, tunable CPL color and programmable CPL control.







Abstract
Circular polarized light is utilized in communication and display technologies and a major challenge is to develop systems that can be switched between left and right circular polarized luminescence with high degrees of polarization and enable multiple addressable stable states. Luminescent dyes in Liquid Crystal (LC) cholesteric phases are attractive systems to generate, amplify and modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In the present study, we employ light&#8208;driven molecular motors as photo&#8208;controlled chiral dopants in LCs to switch the handedness of the LC and the circular polarization of luminescence from an achiral dye embedded in the mesogenic material. Tuning of the color of the CPL and the retention time of the photoprogrammed helicity is demonstrated making use of a variety of motors and dyes. The flexibility offered by the design based on inherently chiral unidirectional rotary motors provides full control over CPL non&#8208;invasively by light, opening possibilities for pixilated displays with externally addressable polarization.

&lt;p&gt;Circular polarized light is utilized in communication and display technologies and a major challenge is to develop systems that can be switched between left and right circular polarized luminescence with high degrees of polarization and enable multiple addressable stable states. Luminescent dyes in Liquid Crystal (LC) cholesteric phases are attractive systems to generate, amplify and modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In the present study, we employ light-driven molecular motors as photo-controlled chiral dopants in LCs to switch the handedness of the LC and the circular polarization of luminescence from an achiral dye embedded in the mesogenic material. Tuning of the color of the CPL and the retention time of the photoprogrammed helicity is demonstrated making use of a variety of motors and dyes. The flexibility offered by the design based on inherently chiral unidirectional rotary motors provides full control over CPL non-invasively by light, opening possibilities for pixilated displays with externally addressable polarization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Closed Aromatic Tubes&#8212;Capsularenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenes can now be incorporated into closed tubes&#8212;capsularenes. These rigid, electron deficient, thermally stable, and tubular molecules with three arenes or acenes at a close distance can lend themselves to the construction of organic electronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we describe a synthetic method for incorporating arenes into closed tubes that we name capsularenes. First, we prepared vase&#8208;shaped molecular baskets 4&#8211;7. The baskets comprise a benzene base fused to three bicycle[2.2.1]heptane rings that extend into phthalimide (4), naphthalimide (6), and anthraceneimide sides (7), each carrying a dimethoxyethane acetal group. In the presence of catalytic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the acetals at top of 4, 6 and 7 change into aliphatic aldehydes followed by their intramolecular cyclization into 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (1H NMR spectroscopy). Such ring closure is nearly a quantitative process that furnishes differently sized capsularenes 1 (0.7&#215;0.9&#8197;nm), 8 (0.7&#215;1.1&#8197;nm;) and 9 (0.7&#215;1.4&#8197;nm;) characterized by X&#8208;Ray crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction, UV/Vis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and thermogravimetry. With exceptional rigidity, unique topology, great thermal stability, and perhaps tuneable optoelectronic characteristics, capsularenes hold promise for the construction of novel organic electronic devices.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Fleeting NiIII Bisphenoxyl Diradical Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiII(salen) complexes have been one of the most promising avenues for those aiming to generate high valent Ni species. The present work is a result of one such inquisitiveness where a NiII(salen) complex was treated with mCPBA to form a novel NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. Various spectroscopic tools and theoretical calculations further assisted our observation. This proposed three electron oxidized species showed oxidation reactivity.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s and Galactose Oxidases exploit redox active ligands to form reactive high valent intermediates for oxidation reactions. This strategy works well for the late 3d metals where accessing high valent states is rather challenging. Herein, we report the oxidation of NiII(salen) (salen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;(1R,2R)&#8208;diamine) with mCPBA (meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) to form a fleeting NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species, in CH3CN and CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses using UV/Vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies revealed oxidation events both on the ligand and the metal centre to yield a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. DFT calculations found the electronic structure of the ligand and the d&#8208;configuration of the metal center to be consistent with a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. This three electron oxidized species can perform hydrogen atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Bioinspired Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;Based Ionic Diode Membrane for High&#8208;Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic diode&#8208;type membranes with rectified current can avoid energy dissipation in the nanochannels during the osmotic energy conversion process. Herein, a bioinspired heterogeneous MXene membrane (BHMXM) is designed with extraordinary ionic rectification, when applied in osmotic energy conversion, the BHMXM&#8208;based power generator can yield a high power density of 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water.







Abstract
Bioinspired asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels with ionic diode behavior that can boost the osmotic energy (so&#8208;called blue energy) conversion are highly desirable, especially if they can be easily constructed and modified. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, combine hydrophilic surfaces and tunable surface charge properties, providing a shortcut to prepare asymmetric nanofluidic ion channels. Here, we report a mechanically robust, flexible, and scale&#8208;up&#8208;friendly asymmetric Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;based ionic diode membrane with a highly rectified current and demonstrate its potential use in reverse electrodialysis osmotic energy conversion. Under the salinity gradient of synthetic seawater and river water, our ionic diode membrane&#8208;based generator&#8216;s power density is 8.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 and up to 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The design of MXene&#8208;based ionic diode&#8208;type membrane provides a facile and general strategy in developing large&#8208;scale 2D nanofluidics and selective ion transport.

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>

         <dc:description>
For the first time, as a proof of concept we report that guest adsorption selectivity in nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor postsynthetic modification method. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest are the major factors in determining the guest selectivity.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone EtP4Q1 show negligible selectivity for C5 hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto EtP4Q1 NACs does not improve the selectivity, while EtP4Q1 NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of n&#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8211;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.

         <title>Central Unit Fluorination of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CH molecules with a new modification site on the central unit of Y&#8208;series electron acceptors has been designed and synthesized to afford better&#8208;performing organic solar cells (OSCs). Further fluorination on the largely unexplored central unit enabled significantly improved photovoltaic performance with over 18% efficiency for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs.







Abstract
Halogenation of terminal of acceptors has been shown to give dramatic improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Similar significant results could be expected from the halogenation of the central units of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Y&#8208;series acceptors. Herein, a pair of acceptors, termed CH6 and CH4, featuring a conjugation&#8208;extended phenazine central unit with and without fluorination, have been synthesized. The fluorinated CH6 has enhanced molecular interactions and crystallinity, superior fibrillar network morphology and improved charge generation and transport in blend films, thus affording a higher PCE of 18.33&#8201;% for CH6&#8208;based binary OSCs compared to 16.49&#8201;% for the non&#8208;fluorinated CH4. The new central site offers further opportunities for structural optimization of Y&#8208;series molecules to afford better&#8208;performed OSCs and reveals the effectiveness of fluorination on central units.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Aza&#8208;Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine&#8208;responsive Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene organic nanoparticles are designed to induce ferroptosis and serve as sonosensitizer. These nanoparticles promote ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy, inducing cancer cell death and tumor growth suppression.







Abstract
The presence of apoptosis inhibition proteins renders the cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, severely compromising the antitumor efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Here, an intelligent anticancer nanoplatform based on an Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dye (denoted as Aza&#8208;BDY) is elaborately established for ferroptosis augmented SDT through cysteine (Cys) starvation. After endocytosis by tumor cells, Aza&#8208;BDY serves as both a ferroptosis inducing agent and a sonosensitizer for tumor treatment. The specific Cys response facilitates the disruption of redox homeostasis and initiation of cellular ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the released sonosensitizer causes efficient SDT and augments ferroptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cys depletion and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation significantly induces cancer&#8208;cell death and suppresses tumor proliferation with a high inhibition rate of 97.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Photocatalytic Removal of the Greenhouse Gas Nitrous Oxide by Liposomal Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled liposome microreactors mimic the spatial separation of redox reactions seen in respiration and photosynthesis. Catalytic reduction of the climate heating gas N2O to benign N2 by encapsulated enzyme is driven by irradiation of external carbon dots through an electron transfer pathway defined by a membrane&#8208;spanning cytochrome and redox&#8208;cycling of internal methyl viologen.







Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse and ozone&#8208;reactive gas for which emissions are growing rapidly due to increasingly intensive agriculture. Synthetic catalysts for N2O decomposition typically contain precious metals and/or operate at elevated temperatures driving a desire for more sustainable alternatives. Here we demonstrate self&#8208;assembly of liposomal microreactors enabling catalytic reduction of N2O to the climate neutral product N2. Photoexcitation of graphitic N&#8208;doped carbon dots delivers electrons to encapsulated N2O Reductase enzymes via a lipid&#8208;soluble biomolecular wire provided by the MtrCAB protein complex. Within the microreactor, electron transfer from MtrCAB to N2O Reductase is facilitated by the general redox mediator methyl viologen. The liposomal microreactors use only earth&#8208;abundant elements to catalyze N2O removal in ambient, aqueous conditions.

         <title>Tetrazine Linkers as Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Tags for General Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Functionalization and C60 Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous UiO&#8208;68 tetrazine metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is used for post&#8208;synthetic ligation chemistry. The central tetrazine rings act as tags for straightforward framework functionalization by a one&#8208;step reaction with alkene, alkyne dienophiles or fullerene. This approach respects the structural integrity of the parent MOF and offers opportunities for functionalization as well as the integration of C60 in crystalline materials.







Abstract
The value of covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification in expanding the chemistry and pore versatility of reticular solids is well documented. Here we use mesoporous crystals of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;68&#8208;TZDC to demonstrate the value of tetrazine connectors for all&#8208;purpose inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder ligation chemistry. Our results suggest a positive effect of tetrazine reticulation over its reactivity for quantitative one&#8208;step functionalization with a broad scope of alkene or alkyne dienophiles into pyridazine and dihydropyridazine frameworks. This permits generating multiple pore environments with diverse chemical functionalities and the expected accessible porosities, that is also extended to the synthesis of crystalline fulleretic materials by covalent conjugation of fullerene molecules.

         <title>Mechanochemically Generated Calcium&#8208;Based Heavy Grignard Reagents and Their Application to Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mechanochemical technique, we have achieved for the first time the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (Ar&#8722;CaX) from commercially available, unactivated calcium metal without applying any pre&#8208;activation process. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles under mechanochemical conditions.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to the use of conventional magnesium&#8208;based Grignard reagents (R&#8722;MgX), the application of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (R&#8722;CaX) in organic synthesis remains poorly explored. This is mainly due to the lack of experimentally simple ways to access such organocalcium nucleophiles from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. Here, we show that a mechanochemical technique using ball milling allows the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents from aryl halides and commercially available calcium metal without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. Notably, all experimental operations can be carried out in air. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which are rather difficult using conventional Grignard reagents. This method will allow synthetic chemists to readily access the novel and unique reactivity of organocalcium nucleophiles.

         <title>Between Elemental Match and Mismatch: From K12Ge3.5Sb6 to Salts of (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722;, and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;</title>

Extraction of the intermetallic phase &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221;, actually comprising the new single&#8208;crystalline compound K12Ge3.5Sb6, yields the long sought&#8208;for binary anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; and larger ones, (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, which place the Ge/Sb combination at the border of elemental match and mismatch. The yet unknown diversity of these binary species predicts a rich follow&#8208;up chemistry.







Abstract
The solid mixture &#8220;K2GeSb&#8221; was shown to comprise single&#8208;crystalline K12Ge3.5Sb6 (1), a double salt of K5[GeSb3] with carbonate&#8208;like [GeSb3]5&#8722; anions, and the metallic Zintl phase K2Ge1.5. Extraction of 1 with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine in the presence of crypt&#8208;222 afforded [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of several novel binary Zintl anions: (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722; (in 2), (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; (in 3), and in the presence of [AuMePPh3] also (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722; (in 4). The anion in 2 represents a predicted, yet heretofore missing pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral anion. 4 comprises a cluster analogous to (Ge4Bi14)4&#8722; and (Ga2Bi16)4&#8722;, and thus one of the most Sb&#8208;rich binary p&#8208;block anions. The unprecedented cluster topology in 3 can be viewed as a defect&#8208;version of the one in 4 upon following a &#8220;dead end&#8221; of cluster growth. The findings indicate that Ge and Sb atoms are at the border of a well&#8208;matching and a mismatch elemental combination. We discuss the syntheses, the geometric structures, and the electronic structures of the new compounds.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Macrocyclic Triangles into Helicity&#8208;Opposite Nanotwists by Competitive Planar over Point Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar chirality emerging from the restriction rotation of achiral edges in macrocyclic triangles containing chiral vertices has led to chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to solution systems, where chiroptical properties are exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerging planar chirality arising from intermolecular stacking controls the chiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
While helix has elegant biomimetic structures and functionalities, it still remains a big question how the nanoscale helicity evolved from the molecular chiral building blocks across length scales. Herein, macrocyclic triangles composed of achiral edges and chiral vertices were rationally designed, in which the planar chirality emerged due to the restriction of edge rotation by intermolecular stackings and led to a unique chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to the solution systems where the chiroptical property is exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerged planar chirality was found to control the chiral self&#8208;assembly, resulting the nanotwist with the handedness determined by the planar chirality. Our work unveiled the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of macrocyclic conformers for the first time and provided a deep understanding on the macrocyclic chirality evolution including the excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>Scaling Catalytic Contributions of Small Self&#8208;Cleaving Ribozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

General base knockout in nucleolytic ribozymes using deazaguanosine&#8208;modified mutants paves the way to scale the relative contributions of the four main strategies (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) applied in ribozyme general acid base catalysis.







Abstract
Nucleolytic ribozymes utilize general acid&#8208;base catalysis to perform phosphodiester cleavage. In most ribozyme classes, a conserved active site guanosine is positioned to act as general base, thereby activating the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group to attack the scissile phosphate (&#947;&#8208;catalysis). Here, we present an atomic mutagenesis study for the pistol ribozyme class. Strikingly, &#8220;general base knockout&#8221; by replacement of the guanine N1 atom by carbon results in only 2.7&#8208;fold decreased rate. Therefore, the common view that &#947;&#8208;catalysis critically depends on the N1 moiety becomes challenged. For pistol ribozymes we found that &#947;&#8208;catalysis is subordinate in overall catalysis, made up by two other catalytic factors (&#945; and &#948;). Our approach allows scaling of the different catalytic contributions (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) with unprecedented precision and paves the way for a thorough mechanistic understanding of nucleolytic ribozymes with active site guanines.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Tetracyclic Pyridinium Alkaloid epi&#8208;Tetradehydrohalicyclamine&#8197;B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conquest of a polycyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid was only made possible by the remarkable chemoselectivity profile of contemporary transition metal catalysts that operate in the presence of basic sites. Ni/Ir photoredox catalysis, Mo&#8208;alkylidynes for alkyne metathesis, and an Ir&#8208;catalyzed lactam&#8208;selective hydrosilylation stand out in this regard.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of a tetracyclic marine pyridinium alkaloid hinged on recent advances in chemoselectivity management: While many classical methods failed to afford the perceptively simple pyridine&#8208;containing core of the target, nickel/iridium photoredox dual catalysis allowed the critical C&#8722;C bond to be formed in good yield. Likewise, ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) worked well in the presence of the unhindered pyridine despite the innately Lewis acidic Mo(+6) center of the alkylidyne catalyst. Finally, an iridium catalyzed hydrosilylation was uniquely effective in reducing a tertiary amide without compromising an adjacent pyridine and the lateral double bonds; this transformation is largely without precedent. The second strained macrocycle enveloping the core was closed by intramolecular N&#8208;alkylation with formation of the pyridinium unit; the reaction proceeded site&#8208; and chemoselectively in the presence of an a priori more basic tertiary amine.

         <title>A 3D Peptide/[60]Fullerene Hybrid for Multivalent Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent ligand presentation is a powerful strategy for the development of specific binders and inhibitors. Peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids have now been synthesized that exploit the complete substitution of the fullerene scaffold to afford globular structures presenting twelve copies of a peptide ligand for the recognition of E&#8208;selectin.







Abstract
Fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts offer an excellent opportunity for multivalent protein recognition. In contrast to monofunctionalized fullerene hybrids, peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts display multiple copies of a peptide in close spatial proximity and in the three dimensions of space. High affinity peptide binders for almost any target can be currently identified by in vitro evolution techniques, often providing synthetically simpler alternatives to natural ligands. However, despite the potential of peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts, these promising conjugates have not been reported to date. Here we present a synthetic strategy for the construction of 3D multivalent hybrids that are able to bind with high affinity the E&#8208;selectin. The here synthesized fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids and their multivalent recognition of natural receptors constitute a proof of principle for their future application as functional biocompatible materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryldifluoromethylation of Aryl Halides with Aryldifluoromethyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes is shown to form diaryl difluoromethanes. A simple dialkyl(dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine ligand for palladium, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;interactions between palladium and the difluorobenzyl ligand during reductive elimination, and a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes enabled the reaction to form diverse products, including those possessing biological activities.







Abstract
Diaryl difluoromethanes are valuable targets for medicinal chemistry because they are bioisosteres of diaryl ethers and can function as replacements for diaryl methane, ketone, and sulfone groups. However, methods to prepare diaryl difluoromethanes are scarce, especially methods starting from abundant aryl halides. We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aryldifluoromethylation of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes (TMSCF2Ar). The reaction occurs when the catalyst contains a simple, but unusual, dialkylaryl phosphine ligand that promotes transmetallation of the silane. Computational studies show that reductive elimination following transmetallation occurs with a low barrier, despite the fluorine atoms on the &#945;&#8208;carbon, due to coordination of the difluorobenzyl &#960;&#8208;system to palladium. The co&#8208;development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes broadened the scope of the process including several applications to the synthesis biologically relevant diaryl difluoromethanes.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage derivatization was used to construct azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides through a radical azidation/heterocyclization cascade. This electrochemical oxidative strategy could be conducted under mild, efficient, and environmentally friendly conditions in buffer solution.







Abstract
As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. Herein, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing a Trp side chain through manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerance, high site selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87&#8201;%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing an azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives, such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.

         <title>Cooperative Surface Passivation and Hierarchical Structuring of Zeolite Beta Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) produces a zeolite with an epitaxially grown Si&#8208;rich shell on the exterior rim, which passivates the surface reactivity. It is also possible to enhance intracrystalline mesoporosity via secondary hydrothermal treatment by taking advantage of intrinsic silanol defects in *BEA.







Abstract
We report a method to prepare core&#8211;shell zeolite beta (*BEA) with an aluminous core and an epitaxial Si&#8208;rich shell. This method capitalizes on the inherent defects in *BEA crystals to simultaneously passivate acid sites on external surfaces and increase intracrystalline mesoporosity through facile post&#8208;hydrothermal synthesis modification in alkaline media. This process creates more hydrophobic materials by reducing silanol defects and enriching the shell in silica via a combination of dealumination and the relocation of silica from the core to the shell during intracrystalline mesopore formation. The catalytic consequences of *BEA core&#8211;shells relative to conventional analogues were tested using the biomass conversion of levulinic acid and n&#8208;butanol to n&#8208;butyl levulinate as a benchmark reaction. Our findings reveal that siliceous shells and intracrystalline mesopores synergistically enhance the performance of *BEA catalysts.

Chiral quinacridines react chemo&#8208; and regioselectively with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII/RhII catalysis, up to four times, achieving a stepwise late&#8208;stage multi&#8208;functionalization of the [4]helicene scaffold. Absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging are readily tuned. Density&#8208;functional theory elucidates the carbene insertion selectivity and clarifies the importance of conformations in the optical response.







Abstract
Chiral quinacridines react up to four times, step&#8208;by&#8208;step, with &#945;&#8208;diazomalonates under RuII and RhII catalysis. By selecting the catalyst, [CpRu(CH3CN)3][PF6] (Cp=cyclopentadienyl) or Rh2(oct)4, chemo and regioselective insertions of derived metal carbenes are achieved in favor of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalized malonate derivatives, respectively, (r.r.&gt;49&#8201;:&#8201;1, up to 77&#8201;% yield, 12 examples). This multi&#8208;introduction of malonate groups is particularly useful to tune optical and chemical properties such as absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging. Density&#8208;functional theory further elucidates the origin of the carbene insertion selectivity and also showcases the importance of conformations in the optical response.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Binding Sites in a Chemically Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

We developed a novel strategy by engineering abundant supramolecular binding sites into a chemically stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a) to achieve simultaneously high C2H2 storage and selectivity, breaking the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Developing porous materials to overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation remains a challenge. Herein, we report a stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a), featuring large cages decorated with high density of supramolecular binding sites to achieve both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. ZJU&#8208;50a exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage capacity (192&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and concurrently high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (12) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;50a crystal unveil that the incorporated supramolecular binding sites can selectively take up C2H2 molecule but not CO2 to result in both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, providing a high C2H2 recovery capacity of 84.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% purity. This study suggests a novel strategy of engineering supramolecular binding sites into MOFs to overcome the trade&#8208;off for this separation.

         <title>Dearomative Aminocarbonylation of Arenes via Bifunctional Coordination to Chromium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium has been firstly developed for amide construction, which expands the boundary of aminocarbonylations from conventional C=C bond substrates to arenes. Furthermore, a switchable 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of arene C&#8722;H bonds and concise synthesis of amide&#8208;type drug analogs were successfully achieved.







Abstract
Amides are ubiquitous in physical and life sciences. Given the significant abundance of arenes, dearomative aminocarbonylation of arenes would lead to a large and underexplored chemical space for amide discovery. However, such reactions are challenging due to the high degree of resonance stabilization and selectivity issues. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented dearomative trifluoromethylative aminocarbonylation of arenes via bifunctional coordination to chromium, providing a modular platform for the construction of amides possessing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups and three&#8208;dimensional rings. Its versatility further enabled a switchable difluoromethylation or trifluoromethylation aminocarbonylation of arene C&#8722;H bonds. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments. Finally, the synthetic utility was well demonstrated by diverse applications in the total synthesis of CF3&#8208;functionalized amide&#8208;type drugs, including praziquantel, nateglinide, maraviroc and alloyohimbane.

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for Concise Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Salinosporamide Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the total syntheses of salinosporamides and cinnabaramides via a strategy involving rapid construction of the highly decorated pyrrolidinone core of the natural products from the simple amino acid serine. The key to the success of this synthesis was to exploit the innate properties of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone as a stereochemical controller and unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Our first strategy for rapidly accessing pyrrolidinone cores of salinosporamides involved combined use of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution principles in aldol reactions of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone substrate, which was ultimately unsuccessful with respect to enantioselectivity. This failure led us to the revised strategy. The influence of the stereocenter in 5&#8208;oxazolidinone enabled selective installation of the C&#8208;2 stereocenter. The intramolecular aldol reaction of the C&#8208;2 stereodefined aldol substrate was successful. An unexpected hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was observed in hydrolyses of the bicyclic aldol products. This unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was utilized in preparing the pyrrolidinone core with excellent efficiency. Through this strategy, the concise total syntheses of salinosporamides A and B as well as cinnabaramides A, E, and F were achieved with high selectivity.

         <title>Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine Photoswitches: Conversion of Excitation Energy into Ring Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine (DBChD), exhibit distinct photo&#8208;switching characters with a high&#8208;energy E&#8208;configuration, especially for sulfur&#8208;bridged DBTD with an energy transduction efficiency of 21&#8201;% (&#951;) under 445&#8197;nm laser activation. Introducing oligothiophene &#960;&#8208;EDG on DBTD could further elevate the absorption &#955;max and coefficient &#1013;, reaching &#951;=29&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted, heteroaryl and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as three key strategies on morphology design of photoswitch to diversify controllability. Cyclic azobenzene is of particular utilization in photo&#8208;energy conversion due to rigid and ring&#8208;strain structure. Despite the well&#8208;recognized diazocine, the photo&#8208;switching properties of seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes (diazepines) have yet been exploited. Herein, we report a family of dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepines (DBChDs) and their T&#8208;type photo&#8208;switching nature with tunable relaxation rate. Based on experiments together with DFT calculations, we found that an unsymmetric 2&#8208;bithiophenyl&#8208;dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine exhibited an efficient response to 445&#8197;nm laser stimulation (quantum efficiency, &#934;Z&#8594;E=0.71) with millisecond relaxation half&#8208;life (t1/2=40&#8197;ms). Photo&#8208;energy transduction efficiency was also exceptionally high with 29.1&#8201;% converted into ring&#8208;strain energy mainly loaded on azo &#960;&#8208;bond.

Molecular doping improves the conductivity of flexible lead&#8208;free MA3Bi2I9 perovskite membranes by four times. Flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieves a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, a high mechanical robustness, which demonstrate potential in next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray detectors have broad applications in medicine and industry. Although flexible lead&#8208;free perovskite films are competitive because of their lightweight and low toxicity, they are less efficient due to low charge transport. Herein, we report low&#8208;toxicity, flexible X&#8208;ray detectors based on p&#8208;type doped MA3Bi2I9 (MA=methylammonium) perovskite&#8208;filled membranes (PFMs). Strong coordination between dopant 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4&#8208;TCNQ) and MA3Bi2I9 and the establishment of charge&#8208;transfer complex (CPX) improved the conductivity by four times. The flexible X&#8208;ray detector achieved a high sensitivity of 2065&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.71&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is among the highest values in all environmentally friendly flexible X&#8208;ray detectors. Importantly, the PFMs retained excellent charge transport under mechanical stress. All of those make flexible MA3Bi2I9 membranes more competitive as next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detection.

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Hydrogen Evolution and Zinc Ion Flux in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous Zn&#8208;COF@Zn anodes have been fabricated to synergistically manipulate the H2 evolution and Zn2+ flux, during which the closely related H2 qualification/inhibition and Zn dendrite&#8208;growth in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries have been studied.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical&#8208;capacity, safety, and low&#8208;cost, yet the H2&#8208;evolution, qualification or inhibition mechanism investigations that are closely related to the dendrite&#8208;growth are rare and challenging. Herein, a series of zincophilic metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (e.g., Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF, Zn&#8208;DAAQ&#8208;COF, and Zn&#8208;DAA&#8208;COF) have been explored as model&#8208;platforms to manipulate the H2&#8208;evolution and Zn2+ flux. Best of them, Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF based cell only produces 0.002&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;H2, which is &gt;2 orders of magnitude lower than bare Zn. Noteworthy, it affords high stability for 3000&#8197;cycles (overpotential, &lt;79.1&#8197;mV) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric&#8208;cell and enhanced cycling&#8208;stability up to 6000&#8197;cycles at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the assembled full&#8208;battery. Besides, mechanistic characterizations show that Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF can enhance the energy&#8208;barrier of H2&#8208;evolution and homogenize the ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed to achieve high performance.

         <title>Asymmetric Oxidative Lactonization of Enynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein the first oxidation of enynyl boronates for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, including spiro&#8208;, and fused&#8208;butanolides as well as butenolides that are prevalent in nature products and bioactive molecules. The asymmetric version of this oxidation was also achieved in the presence of chiral ketone and Oxone. This process successively involves the oxidation of C(sp)&#8722;B bond, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond, and the lactonization.







Abstract
Oxidation of C&#8722;B bonds is extensively used in organic synthesis, materials science, and chemically biology. However, these oxidations are usually limited to the oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;B and C(sp2)&#8722;B bonds. The C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation is rarely developed. Herein we present a novel strategy for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones via the oxidation of enynyl boronates. This process successively involves the C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond and the lactonization. This protocol provided various &#947;&#8208;lactones and unsaturated butenolides efficiently that are prevalent in numerous nature products and bioactive molecules. Most importantly, asymmetric oxidative lactonization of enynyl boronates was also achieved, providing chiral &#947;&#8208;lactones in high enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. The versatile transformations and ubiquity of &#947;&#8208;lactones shed light on the importance of this strategy in the construction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Single Au Atoms on Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction towards CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Au atoms in Au1&#8208;S2 low&#8208;coordination structure on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were prepared by a rational complex&#8208;exchange route. Endowed with much faster interfacial electron transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 photosensitizer and more appropriate binding strength with *CO intermediates, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms surpass Au nanoparticles counterpart in CO2 photoreduction, leading to CH4 product with both high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to hydrocarbon fuels such as CH4 is promising and sustainable for carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, lack of proper binding strengths with reaction intermediates makes it still a challenge for photocatalytic CO2 methanation with both high activity and selectivity. Here, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms (Au1&#8208;S2) on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets was synthesized by a complex&#8208;exchange route, enabling exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, Au1/ZnIn2S4 catalyst exhibits a CH4 yield of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity as high as 77&#8201;%. As revealed by detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations, Au1/ZnIn2S4 with Au1&#8208;S2 structure not only display fast carrier transfer to underpin its superior activity, but also greatly reduce the energy barrier for protonation of *CO and stabilize the *CH3 intermediate, thereby leading to the selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Nonsubstituted Quinoline&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidant&#8208;free locking of a dynamic imine bridge to construct the ultrastable nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is reported. This methodology features high efficiency, generality, retention of crystallinity and topology. The enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation facilitates photocatalytic organic transformations mediated by superoxide anion radicals.







Abstract
Exploring new routes to lock the dynamic C=N bonds in imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is highly desired for enhancing their stability and functionality. Herein, a novel C=N bridge locking strategy via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is developed to construct nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8208;COFs). The notable feature of this strategy includes high C=N conversion efficiency, oxidant&#8208;free, and generality for synthesis of a variety of NQ&#8208;COFs with high chemical stability. Particularly, after post&#8208;synthetic modification, the crystallinity, topology, and porosity of pristine imine&#8208;linked COFs are well retained. When used as photocatalysts, NQ&#8208;COFs display better visible light absorption and carriers&#8217; separation efficiency due to enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960; conjugation ability, as well as more facile generation of superoxide anion radicals than their counterparts, thus leading to efficient synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(aryl)pyridines, benzimidazole, and sulfoxide derivatives.

         <title>Open&#8208;Bandgap Graphene&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Using Oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine&#8208;functionalized oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) (OPE) was introduced as an interface on wafer&#8208;scale graphene in the form of self&#8208;assembled monolayers through anion&#8208;based reaction. The band gap was opened by electron transfer from OPE to graphene via covalent bonding. This property offers high efficiency for graphene&#8208;based transistor applications.







Abstract
Organic interfacial compounds (OICs) are required as linkers for the highly stable and efficient immobilization of bioprobes in nanobiosensors using 2D nanomaterials such as graphene. Herein, we first demonstrated the fabrication of a field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) via a microelectromechanical system process after covalent functionalization on large&#8208;scale graphene by introducing oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)amine (OPE). OPE was compared to various OICs by density functional theory simulations and was confirmed to have a higher binding energy with graphene and a lower band gap than other OICs. OPE can improve the immobilization efficiency of a bioprobe by forming a self&#8208;assembly monolayer via anion&#8208;based reaction. Using this technology, Magainin I&#8208;conjugated OGMFET (MOGMFET) showed a high sensitivity, high selectivity, with a limit of detection of 100&#8197;cfu&#8201;mL&#8722;1. These results indicate that the OPE OIC can be applied for stable and comfortable interfacing technology for biosensor fabrication.

         <title>Antineoplastic Enzyme as Drug Carrier with Activatable Catalytic Activity for Efficient Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Glucose oxidase (GOx) as drug carrier delivers anticancer drugs including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. These nanodrugs show acid&#8208;activatable enzyme activity of GOx, thus allowing relatively safe intravenous administration of GOx and effective combination of GOx&#8208;mediated cancer starvation&#8208;like therapy and chemotherapy/photothermal therapy/tumor ferroptosis against 4T1 breast tumors.







Abstract
The delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx) requires extra carriers, which suffers from early leakage and exposure of GOx. These issues will be of less concern if GOx itself acts as a drug carrier. However, the catalytic activity of GOx in the blood still needs to be inhibited. Herein, we found that GOx could self&#8208;assemble with hydrophobic molecules into uniform and stable nanoparticles (NPs), including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. The catalytic activity of GOx in NPs was significantly inhibited due to the binding of small molecules with its hydrophobic pockets. After dissociation in the tumor acidic microenvironment, the enzyme activity of GOx could be largely recovered. This acidity&#8208;triggered &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; process ensured safe intravenous administration of GOx&#8208;based NPs. In vivo experiments showed that the combined starvation therapy and ferroptosis/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy effectively inhibited 4T1 breast tumor growth.

By means of density functional theory calculations, ethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphinates (ETPs) were discovered as modular and cysteine&#8208;selective electrophiles for bioconjugation. Using CuI&#8208;click chemistry in aqueous buffers, this functional group can be easily introduced into azide&#8208;containing (bio&#8208;)molecules. These reagents can be used for proteome&#8208;wide cysteine profiling and to obtain functional peptide&#8208; and protein conjugates, as well as protein&#8211;protein conjugates .







Abstract
We report the density functional theory (DFT) guided discovery of ethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphinates (ETPs) as a new class of electrophilic warheads for cysteine selective bioconjugation. By using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) in aqueous buffer, we were able to access a variety of functional electrophilic building blocks, including proteins, from diethynyl&#8208;phosphinate. ETP&#8208;reagents were used to obtain fluorescent peptide&#8208;conjugates for receptor labelling on live cells and a stable and a biologically active antibody&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugate. Moreover, we were able to incorporate ETP&#8208;electrophiles into an azide&#8208;containing ubiquitin under native conditions and demonstrate their potential in protein&#8211;protein conjugation. Finally, we showcase the excellent cysteine&#8208;selectivity of this new class of electrophile in mass spectrometry based, proteome&#8208;wide cysteine profiling, underscoring the applicability in homogeneous bioconjugation strategies to connect two complex biomolecules.

The design and synthesis of a library of ion exchange resins that are selective for PFAS removal from real water enabled the evaluation of structure&#8211;property relationships of the chemically stable polymer networks with high PFAS affinity. The granular Ionic Fluorogel resin is a potent PFAS remediation sorbent and demonstrated excellent performance in translationally relevant flow&#8208;through packed bed columns using natural water.







Abstract
PFAS are known bioaccumulative and persistent chemicals which pollute natural waters globally. There exists a lack of granular sorbents to efficiently remove both legacy and emerging PFAS at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, we report a class of polymer networks with a synergistic combination of ionic and fluorous components that serve as granular materials for the removal of anionic PFAS from water. A library of Ionic Fluorogels (IFs) with systematic variation in charge density and polymer network architecture was synthesized from hydrolytically stable fluorous building blocks. The IFs were demonstrated as effective sorbents for the removal of 21 legacy and emerging PFAS from a natural water and were regenerable over multiple cycles of reuse. Comparison of one IF to a commercial ion exchange resin in mini&#8208;rapid small&#8208;scale column tests demonstrated superior performance for the removal of short&#8208;chain PFAS from natural water under operationally relevant conditions.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Chemokine Conjugates for In Vivo Targeting of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for selective targeting of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages in preclinical models of cancer. We demonstrate that this new chemical design is compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic payloads, opening avenues in the preparation of future theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Increased levels of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are indicators of poor prognosis in most cancers. Although antibodies and small molecules blocking the recruitment of macrophages to tumors are under evaluation as anticancer therapies, these strategies are not specific for macrophage subpopulations. Herein we report the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for effective targeting of defined macrophage subsets in live tumors. Our constructs exploit the high expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR2) and the activity of cysteine cathepsins in TAMs to target these cells selectively over other macrophages and immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, T cells, B cells). Furthermore, we demonstrate that cathepsin&#8208;activatable chemokines are compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic cargos, opening new avenues in the design of targeted theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

First explorations of binary Ge/Sb Zintl anions indicated a situation between a &#8220;matching&#8221; one and one that tends to element segregation owing to a mismatch in atom sizes. Extraction of the ternary solid K12Ge3.5Sb6 allowed access to the so far missing P4&#8208;like anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, as well as to species that show tendencies for spatial separation of Ge and Sb atoms, &#8220;incomplete&#8221; (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and &#8220;complete&#8221; (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, as confirmed by DFT calculations and described by Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202207232).

A self&#8208;assembled glucose oxidase (GOx) nanoparticle that falls into the sea and dissociates into several enzymes is depicted in the picture illustrating the Research Article by Peng Huang and co&#8208;workers (e202208583). After dissociation, GOx regains its catalytic activity and catalyzes the oxidization of glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2. It's like someone pressing the &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2&#8221; switch that crosses the sea surface.

         <dc:description>
A ball&#8208;milling approach allows the efficient activation of calcium metal and thus makes the direct generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents feasible without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. By using this operationally simple method, Koji Kubota, Hajime Ito, and co&#8208;workers developed a novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles in their Research Article (e202207118), which is typically difficult using conventional Grignard reagents.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to fibrous membrane materials owing to the complex healing mechanism and particular porous structure. In this Minireview self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes are introduced and described in detail in terms of design strategies and preparation methods. The current state of the art, existing challenges, and future outlook for this promising field are systematically summarized.







Abstract
Inspired by the self&#8208;healing function of living organisms, self&#8208;healing materials have been developed in recent decades to very high standards. As a new direction, self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes (SFMs) exhibit both the configuration of a porous structure and self&#8208;healing capability within one material. Different from nonporous self&#8208;healing materials, it is more challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to porous fibrous membrane materials owing to the more complex healing mechanism and microstructure of SFMs. This Minireview focuses on the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, design principles, and preparation strategies of SFMs. The characteristics of SFM self&#8208;healing performance are introduced in detail, and insights and perspectives of SFM preparation and healing mechanisms are put forward. Furthermore, remaining challenges and future developments of SFMs are presented, where the ultimate goal is the design of highly efficient self&#8208;healing and superstable fibrous membranes.

         <title>Physical and Chemical Cues at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface for Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunomodulation has made tremendous progress in fighting diseases. In the past decade, it was demonstrated that nanomaterials can directly induce immunomodulation. To summarize this emerging research field, we systematically discuss a series of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface in order to better understand nanomaterials&#8208;regulated immunosignaling pathways as well as the outcomes in disease control and treatment.







Abstract
Immunomodulation has made remarkable progress in fighting infectious disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relies on chemical/biochemical agents, which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off&#8208;target adverse effects. Recent insights into nano&#8211;bio interactions suggest that nanomaterials can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of physical and chemical cues at the nano&#8211;bio interface have been harnessed to regulate diverse immuno&#8208;signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview, we summarize recent studies on the physical and chemical cues enabled by intrinsic nanomaterials to trigger immunological signaling. First, we discuss physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge, and heat at the nano&#8211;bio interface for immunomodulation. Then, various nanomaterials enabled chemical cues, such as metal species and oxidative species are outlined. Finally, our perspectives on challenges and possible future directions are provided.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we focus on the quenching mechanisms, types, and biomedical applications of these quenchers.

For fluorogenic probes, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to realize the detection of biochemical activities. Dark quenchers relax from the excited state to the ground state non&#8208;radiatively, and are promising alternatives to fluorescent FRET acceptors. Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we summarize the relevant advances of small&#8208;molecule quenchers that are used in FRET&#8208;based probes. This Review is intended to provide suggestions regarding the rationale design and selection of appropriate fluorophore&#8211;quencher FRET pairs, which are fully compatible with challenging analytical applications in various biological systems. Finally, an outlook of the future biomedical applications and developments of this field is presented.

         <title>How Subtle Changes Can Make a Difference: Reproducibility in Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of complex systems often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and narrow windows of suitable conditions. In this Scientific Perspective, we report on unexpected observations made in our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. We draw attention to often overlooked details and aim to initiate an open discussion on reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The desire to construct complex molecular systems is driven by the need for technological (r)evolution and our intrinsic curiosity to comprehend the origin of life. Supramolecular chemists tackle this challenge by combining covalent and noncovalent reactions leading to multicomponent systems with emerging complexity. However, this synthetic strategy often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and a narrow window of suitable conditions. Here, we report on unsuspected observations of our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. Based on the effects of pathway complexity, minute amounts of water in organic solvents or small impurities in the supramolecular building block, we discuss potential pitfalls in the study of complex systems. This article is intended to draw attention to often overlooked details and to initiate an open discussion on the importance of reporting experimental details to increase reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring Bond Microenvironments and Reaction Pathways of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) in water electrolysis is critical to guide the future design, performance optimization, and broad applications of single&#8208;atom catalysts. This Review summarizes the most recent progress in tailoring the bond microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts on different supports and discusses the reaction pathways, mechanisms, and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) are commonly stabilized and influenced by neighboring atoms in the host; disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of SASs in water electrolysis is one of the grand challenges originating from the tremendous wealth of support materials with complex structures. Through a multidisciplinary view of the design principles, synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlations, this timely Review is dedicated to summarizing the most recent progress in tailoring bond microenvironments on different supports and discussing the reaction pathways and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis. The essence and mechanisms of how SAS structures influence electrocatalysis and the critical requirements for future developments are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are also provided to stimulate the practical, widespread utilization of SAS catalysts in water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers.

         <title>An Fe6C Core in All Nitrogenase Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Earlier spectroscopic and structural studies have shown that the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases contain a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide. Here, we used valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (VtC XES) to probe the presence of a carbide in the cofactor of iron nitrogenase. The presence of a K&#946;&#8242;&#8242; peak at 7100&#8197;eV reveals an interstitial carbon, showing that the cofactor of Fe nitrogenase contains an Fe6C core.







Abstract
The biological process of dinitrogen reduction to ammonium occurs at the cofactors of nitrogenases, the only enzymes that catalyze this challenging chemical reaction. Three types of nitrogenases have been described, named according to the heterometal in their cofactor: molybdenum, vanadium or iron nitrogenases. Spectroscopic and structural characterization allowed the unambiguous identification of the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases and revealed a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide in both of them. Although genetic studies suggested that the cofactor of the iron nitrogenase contains a similar Fe6C core, this has not been experimentally demonstrated. Here we report Valence&#8208;to&#8208;Core X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy providing experimental evidence that this cofactor contains a carbide, thereby making the Fe6C core a feature of all nitrogenase cofactors.

         <title>Ketenes in the Induction of the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

Operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy identifies ketene and methylketene intermediates in methyl acetate conversion over the HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. The surface acetyl to olefins mechanism proceeds via methylation and decarbonylation processes.







Abstract
Ketene (CH2=C=O) has been postulated as a key intermediate for the first olefin production in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed chemistry of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) and syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) processes. The reaction mechanism remains elusive, because the short&#8208;lived ethenone ketene and its derivatives are difficult to detect, which is further complicated by the low expected ketene concentration. We report on the experimental detection of methylketene (CH3&#8722;CH=C=O) formed by the methylation of ketene on HZSM&#8208;5 via operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy. Ketene is produced in situ from methyl acetate. The observation of methylketene as the ethylene precursor evidences a computationally predicted ketene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene route proceeding via a methylketene intermediate followed by decarbonylation.

         <title>Rapid Access to Diverse Multicomponent Hierarchical Nanostructures from Mixed&#8208;Graft Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were synthesized from three or four different types of macromonomers. The morphology of hierarchical nanostructures assembled from the prepared graft copolymers was readily diversified by varying the sequence, number, and molar ratio of the side chains.







Abstract
Multicomponent nanostructured materials assembled from molecular building blocks received wide attention due to their precisely integrated multifunctionalities. However, discovery of these materials with desirable composition and morphology was limited by their low synthetic scalability and narrow structural tuning window with given building blocks. Here, we report a scalable and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach to hierarchically structured nanomaterials based on a few readily accessible building blocks. Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were prepared through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of three or four types of macromonomers. Intramolecularly defined interfaces promoted the formation of ordered hierarchical structures with lattice sizes tunable across multiple length scales. The same set of macromonomers were arranged and combined in different ways, providing access to diverse morphologies in the resultant structures.

     alt="Rapid Access to Diverse Multicomponent Hierarchical Nanostructures from Mixed-Graft Block Copolymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed-graft block copolymers containing sequence-defined side chains were synthesized from three or four different types of macromonomers. The morphology of hierarchical nanostructures assembled from the prepared graft copolymers was readily diversified by varying the sequence, number, and molar ratio of the side chains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicomponent nanostructured materials assembled from molecular building blocks received wide attention due to their precisely integrated multifunctionalities. However, discovery of these materials with desirable composition and morphology was limited by their low synthetic scalability and narrow structural tuning window with given building blocks. Here, we report a scalable and diversity-oriented synthetic approach to hierarchically structured nanomaterials based on a few readily accessible building blocks. Mixed-graft block copolymers containing sequence-defined side chains were prepared through ring-opening metathesis copolymerization of three or four types of macromonomers. Intramolecularly defined interfaces promoted the formation of ordered hierarchical structures with lattice sizes tunable across multiple length scales. The same set of macromonomers were arranged and combined in different ways, providing access to diverse morphologies in the resultant structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Reagents for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring members of the thiopurine methyltransferase family have been found to accept synthetic methyl sulfates or methyl sulfonates as methyl donors for the stereoselective methylation of S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine to form S&#8208;adenosylmethionine. This activity can be used for co&#8208;substrate regeneration in methyltransferase biocatalysis.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage methylation is a key technology in the development of pharmaceutical compounds. Methyltransferase biocatalysis may provide powerful options to insert methyl groups into complex molecules with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. The challenge of a large&#8208;scale application of methyltransferases is their dependence on S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a stoichiometric, and thus exceedingly expensive co&#8208;substrate. As a solution to this problem, we and others have explored the use of methyl halides as reagents for the in situ regeneration of SAM. However, the need to handle volatile electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI), may also hamper applications at scale. As a more practical solution, we have now developed an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process for the regeneration of SAM with methyl toluene sulfonate. Herein, we describe enzymes from the thiopurine methyltransferase family that accept sulfate&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;based methyl donors to convert S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine into SAM with efficiencies that rival MeI&#8208;based reactions.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Directed Reversal of 13C NMR Chemical Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding behavior of carbonyl carbon in sulfur and selenium substituted H&#8208;bonded amides. Solution phase NMR spectroscopy corroborated with various computational studies explains the physical origin of such unusual behavior.







Abstract
The deshielding or downfield 13C NMR chemical shift of amide carbonyl carbon upon H&#8208;bonding is a widely observed phenomenon. This downfield shift is commonly used as a spectroscopic ruler for H&#8208;bonding. However, the very first observation of an upfield 13C NMR of thiocarbonyl carbon in thioamides upon H&#8208;bonding encouraged us to explore the physical origin of the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding. Careful NMR analysis shows that sulfur and selenium&#8208;centered H&#8208;bonds (S/SeCHBs) induce a shielding effect on the 13CC=S(Se) while changing from amides to thioamides or selenoamides. In addition, natural chemical shielding (NCS) analysis shows that the &#963;11 and &#963;22 components of the isotropic shielding tensor (&#963;) have a crucial role in this unusual shielding.

We generated bench&#8208;top stable fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes and their application to the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes via the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported. To demonstrate their synthetic utility, the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes were transformed to fluoroalkene derivatives and all&#8208;carbon substituted alkenes.







Abstract
Reported herein is the efficient synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes by the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction of ketones and aldehydes with bench&#8208;top stable halo&#8208;diborylmethanes. The substrate scope is broad and the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction proceeds from a diverse range of ketones and aldehydes including biologically relevant molecules with fluoro&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes, providing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes in good yields with high stereoselectivity. The utilities of the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes are highlighted by further modifications to afford fluoroalkene derivatives or all&#8208;carbon substituted alkene.

Complexes formed between aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) acceptors and arylamine donors showed through&#8208;space charge transfer as well as a &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interaction between the acceptor and the donor. Owing to these properties, the complexes served as far&#8208;red fluorescent nanoprobes with two&#8208;photon excitation. The probe was applied to in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.







Abstract
Much effort has been devoted to the generation of fluorescent probes by synthetic approaches. In this study, we developed a facile strategy to construct far&#8208;red fluorescent probes based on through&#8208;space charge transfer within complexes of acceptors and donors and their &#8220;twist+twist&#8221; interactions. Owing to their rare two&#8208;photon excitation property, the complexes could be used for in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebrovascular system.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Antimony&#8208;Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antitumor Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel soluble and water&#8208;stable giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) has been developed, which shows the largest Sb&#8722;Ln&#8722;W cluster and has the greatest number of Sb centers in a cluster yet found in POM chemistry. Importantly, the Sb&#8208;rich POM can exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor and anti&#8208;metastatic activities in vitro and in vivo without causing adverse effects, making it a promising candidate for a antitumor agent.







Abstract
Herein, a giant Sb&#8208;rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb21Tb7W56} is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb&#8208;rich POM has many interesting structural features and is a rare example of a soluble and water&#8208;stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb&#8208;rich POM exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53&#8208;dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb&#8208;rich POM was capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of a breast cancer in vivo.

     alt="A Water-Soluble Antimony-Rich Polyoxometalate with Broad-Spectrum Antitumor Activities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel soluble and water-stable giant Sb-rich polyoxometalate (POM) has been developed, which shows the largest Sb&#8722;Ln&#8722;W cluster and has the greatest number of Sb centers in a cluster yet found in POM chemistry. Importantly, the Sb-rich POM can exhibit broad-spectrum antitumor and anti-metastatic activities in vitro and in vivo without causing adverse effects, making it a promising candidate for a antitumor agent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a giant Sb-rich polyoxometalate (POM) {Sb&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;Tb&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;} is reported, which contains the largest number of Sb atoms in a POM so far. The Sb-rich POM has many interesting structural features and is a rare example of a soluble and water-stable giant POM. Biomedical studies indicate that the Sb-rich POM exhibits broad-spectrum antitumor activity against various cancer cell lines by reactivating the P53-dependent apoptotic processes and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. In addition, this Sb-rich POM was capable of suppressing the growth and metastasis of a breast cancer in vivo. This work demonstrates that Sb-rich POMs are promising candidates for the development of new anticancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials Based on Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole with an Efficient Narrowband Pure&#8208;Green Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the multiple&#8208;resonance ability of the indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit with boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons has led to compounds that show efficient green emission (CIE: 0.21, 0.71) and efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). OLEDs incorporating these multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials show a pure narrowband green emission (CIE: 0.22, 0.71) and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.2&#8201;%







Abstract
Herein, we report two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (VTCzBN and TCz&#8208;VTCzBN) based on indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole unit and boron&#8208;nitrogen skeletons, whose emissions peaking at 496 and 521&#8197;nm with full width at half maximum of 34 and 29&#8197;nm, respectively. Meanwhile, fast rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing of above 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 are obtained due to small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and large spin&#8208;orbital coupling values. Notably, planar molecular structures along the transition dipole moment direction endow them with high horizontal emitting dipole ratios of up to 94&#8201;%. Consequently, the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show the maximum external quantum efficiencies of 31.7&#8201;% and 32.2&#8201;%, respectively. Particularly, OLED with TCz&#8208;VTCzBN display ultra&#8208;pure green emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinates of (0.22, 0.71), consistent with the green display standard of the National Television System Committee.

         <title>Single Atom Ru Monolithic Electrode for Efficient Chlorine Evolution and Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>

We report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to synthesize monolithic single atom electrodes. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution and nitrate reduction performances. The scalability and bifunctionality of Ru single atom electrode highlight its great potential of electrochemical applications.







Abstract
Fabricating single&#8208;atom electrodes via atomic dispersion of active metal atoms into monolithic metal supports is of great significance to advancing the lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation of the electrochemical technologies. Here, we report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to fasten ligand&#8208;free isolated Ru atoms on the amorphous layer of monolithic Ti support by regulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution activity, three orders of magnitude higher mass activity than that of commercial dimensionally stable anode, and also selectively reduced nitrate to ammonia with an unprecedented ammonia yield rate of 22.2&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the Ru single atom monolithic electrode can be scaled up from 2&#215;2&#8197;cm to 25&#215;15&#8197;cm at least, thus demonstrating great potential for industrial electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Simultaneous and Spontaneous Oxidation and Reduction in Microdroplets by the Water Radical Cation/Anion Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous oxidation and reduction of phosphonate occur simultaneously in microdroplets. The key active species are the endogenous water radical cation and anion derived from water molecules and present at the droplet surface.







Abstract
Microdroplets show unique chemistry, especially in their intrinsic redox properties, and to this we here add a case of simultaneous and spontaneous oxidation and reduction. We report the concurrent conversions of several phosphonates to phosphonic acids by reduction (R&#8722;P &#8594; H&#8722;P) and to pentavalent phosphoric acids by oxidation. The experimental results suggest that the active reagent is the water radical cation/anion pair. The water radical cation is observed directly as the ionized water dimer while the water radical anion is only seen indirectly though the spontaneous reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. The coexistence of oxidative and reductive species in turn supports the proposal of a double&#8208;layer structure at the microdroplet surface, where the water radical cation and radical anion are separated and accumulated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Carboxylation of Organic Halides in the Presence of Catalytic Amounts of an Organomediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and metal&#8208;free method for the electroreductive carboxylation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds has been developed to obtain carboxylated compounds in the presence of catalytic amounts of naphthalene as a mediator. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, and is shown to be a powerful approach for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X=Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylations of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds via single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.

         <title>Static and Dynamic Gradient Based Directional Transportation of Neutral Molecules in Swollen Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral molecules are transported along a pre&#8208;defined pathway via static and dynamic chemical gradient respectively. A static hexyl to hydroxyl functionalized gradient could pull the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate towards hydroxyl&#8208;rich region. A dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) formed by a coupled reaction&#8208;diffusion process was utilized to drive the neutral non&#8208;polar molecule pyrene.







Abstract
Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Neutral molecules are transported along a pre-defined pathway via static and dynamic chemical gradient respectively. A static hexyl to hydroxyl functionalized gradient could pull the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate towards hydroxyl-rich region. A dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) formed by a coupled reaction-diffusion process was utilized to drive the neutral non-polar molecule pyrene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated. Using an &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60-fold within 4&#8197;hours.

As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogenation of Electron&#8208;Poor Alkenes and Dienes Enabled by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydride Addition/Protonolysis Mechanism

Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos in methanol catalyzes the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor dienes and related substrates at low metal loadings via a hydride addition/Rh&#8208;enolate protonation pathway.







Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes is a well&#8208;developed technology used on lab scale as well as on large scales in the chemical industry. Site&#8208; and chemoselective mono&#8208;hydrogenations of polarized conjugated dienes remain challenging. Instead, stoichiometric main&#8208;group hydrides are used rather than H2. As part of an effort to develop a scalable route to prepare geranylacetone, we discovered that Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos based catalysts enable the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes, enones, and other polyunsaturated substrates. D&#8208;labeling and DFT studies support a mechanism where a nucleophilic RhI&#8208;hydride selectively adds to electron&#8208;poor alkenes and the resulting Rh&#8208;enolate undergoes subsequent inner&#8208;sphere protonation by alcohol solvent. The finding that (Ln)Rh(H)(CO) type catalysts can enable selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes provides a valuable tool in the design of related chemoselective hydrogenation processes.

         <title>Atropopeptides are a Novel Family of Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally Modified Peptides with a Complex Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropopeptides are a family of ribosomally synthesized and postranslationally modified peptides with an unusual complex molecular shape. A single cytochrome P450 is sufficient for the atropospecific introduction of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. A two&#8208;step maturation process yields hexa&#8208; and pentapeptide products that act as signaling metabolites and show proliferative and pro&#8208;migratory properties in endothelial cell cultures.







Abstract
Biomacromolecules are known to feature complex three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are essential for their function. Among natural products, ambiguous molecular shapes are a rare phenomenon. The hexapeptide tryptorubin A can adopt one of two unusual atropisomeric configurations. Initially hypothesized to be a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide, we show that tryptorubin A is the first characterized member of a new family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that we named atropopeptides. The sole modifying enzyme encoded in the gene cluster, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is responsible for the atropospecific formation of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. The characterization of two additional atropopeptide biosynthetic pathways revealed a two&#8208;step maturation process. Atropopeptides promote pro&#8208;angiogenic cell functions as indicated by an increase in endothelial cell proliferation and undirected migration. Our study expands the biochemical space of RiPP&#8208;modifying enzymes and paves the way towards the chemoenzymatic utilization of atropopeptide&#8208;modifying P450s.

         <title>Fluorinated Copolypeptide&#8208;Stabilized Microbubbles with Maleimide&#8208;Decorated Surfaces as Long&#8208;Term Ultrasound Contrast Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic fluorinated copolypeptides are used to stabilize perfluorocarbon&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) with the formation of highly stable ultrasound (US) contrast agents. Moreover, the US signals can be remarkably enhanced by the in situ reaction of peripheral maleimide moieties with plasma proteins without compromising the stability of MBs, outperforming commercially available SonoVueTM MBs in in vivo US imaging applications.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;filled microbubbles (MBs) have been clinically used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, it remains a great challenge to resolve the dilemma of stability and contrast enhancement of MBs. Herein, amphiphilic copolypeptides bearing fluorinated blocks are synthesized to stabilize perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;filled MBs, exhibiting unique stability under both long&#8208;term storage and US imaging conditions. The fluorinated inner layer reduces the internal Laplace pressure and greatly improves the stability of MBs, which can be further reinforced by crosslinking of the dipropargyl&#8208;containing middle blocks. To overcome the suppressed nonlinear oscillation of polymer shells, maleimide groups are introduced onto the surface of MBs, enabling in situ reaction with plasma proteins to enhance second harmonic signals without compromising the stability of MBs, conferring better US imaging performance than that of SonoVueTM MBs.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented under mild conditions. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and acidic methylene with protons, are good precursors for three&#8208;membered ring formation, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered cyclic structures are widely existing in natural products and serve as enabling intermediates in organic synthesis. However, the efficient and straightforward access to such structures with diversity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a general and practical protocol to aziridines and cyclopropanes synthesis using free XH2 (X=C or N) with alkenes by thianthrenation is presented. This metal&#8208;free protocol features the direct aziridination and cyclopropanation with unprotected XH2. Free sulfonamides, amides, carbamates, amines, and methylene with acidic protons, are good precursors, providing an attractive alternative for straightforward synthesis of aziridines and cyclopropanes from easily available starting materials.

         <title>Less is More: A Shortcut for Anionocages Design Based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;Monourea Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergent hydrogen bonding motif of phosphotyrosine residues of proteins has inspired an advanced strategy for the design of a new type of anionocage based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, which features more simple synthesis and more potential of functionalization than the former strategy based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, providing a proof of the design concept &#8220;Less is More&#8221;.







Abstract
Anionocages have been developed as a unique family of hydrogen bonded cages. However, strategies for constructing anionocages are mainly limited to that based on (PO43&#8722;)&#8208;bisurea coordination, neither the ligands nor the anions lack the simplicity and diversity of the maturely developed analogues based on metal coordination (i.e. metallocage). We report herein a more simple strategy for anionocages design based on (RPO32&#8722;)&#8208;monourea coordination, utilizing monourea rather than bisurea as the hydrogen binding donor, and RPO32&#8722; rather than PO43&#8722; as the acceptor. Two fluorescent, quadruple helicate anionocages were constructed by a bis&#8208;monourea ligand, and dianions PhOPO32&#8722; (H1) or HOPO32&#8722; (H1A), respectively, which were capable of encapsulating a series of cation guests. As revealed by molecular modeling, H1 features remarkable guest&#8208;adaptive cavity breathing without change of the quadruple helicate topology, which allowed the encapsulation of different sized guests in an &#8220;induced fit&#8221; manner.

         <title>SpeedMixing: Rapid Tribochemical Synthesis and Discovery of Pharmaceutical Cocrystals without Milling or Grinding Media
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of SpeedMixing, a rapid blending technology, for rapid and scalable synthesis and discovery of pharmaceutical cocrystals without using either bulk solvents or milling media is reported. SpeedMixing permits selective synthesis of cocrystal polymorphs, stoichiomorphs and revealed the first solvate of the archetypal pharmaceutical cocrystal of carbamazepine and saccharin, that has remained unknown despite 20&#8197;years of research and screening.







Abstract
We present SpeedMixing, a rapid blending technology, as an approach for fast mechanosynthesis and discovery of model pharmaceutical cocrystals through rapid spinning in the absence of bulk solvents and milling/grinding media. Syntheses of pharmaceutical cocrystals based on the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) carbamazepine, dihydrocarbamazepine, and nicotinamide demonstrate SpeedMixing as a method for rapid, scalable, as well as controllable and selective synthesis of cocrystals, cocrystal polymorphs and stoichiomorphs, including the discovery of an unexpected methanol solvate of the archetypal cocrystal of carbamazepine and saccharin, which has eluded extensive screens over 20&#8197;years.

         <title>Synthesis of Square Planar Cu4 Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 41, October 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polynuclear reaction sites catalyze some of the most challenging transformations in chemistry. Programmatic assembly of atomically&#8208;precise cluster compounds is challenging. Here we describe the synthesis of supramolecular ligands designed to nucleate well&#8208;defined square planar tetranuclear copper clusters, establishing metal&#8208;metal interactions capable of delocalizing oxidation stress across the cluster.







Abstract
Template&#8208;assisted synthesis of well&#8208;defined polynuclear clusters remains a challenge for [M4] square planar topologies. Herein, we present a tetraamine scaffold RL(NH2)4, where L is a rigidified resorcin[4]arene, to direct the formation of C4&#8208;symmetric RL(NH)4Cu4 clusters with Cu&#8722;Cu distances around 2.7&#8197;&#197;, suggesting metal&#8208;metal direct interactions are operative since the sum of copper's van der Waals radii is 2.8&#8197;&#197;. DFT calculations display HOMO to HOMO&#8208;3 residing all within a 0.1&#8197;eV gap. These four orbitals display significant electron density contribution from the Cu centers suggesting a delocalized electronic structure. The one&#8208;electron oxidized [Cu4]+ species was probed by variable temperature X&#8208;band continuous wave&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance (CW&#8208;EPR), which displays a multiline spectrum at room temperature. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for [M4] clusters and a new platform to investigate activation of small molecules.

         <dc:description>The selective d&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8208;H acetoxylation of  N  &#8209;(SO  2  Py)&#8208;protected amino acid derivatives has been accomplished by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)  2  (PIDA) as both terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The distinct structural and electronic features of the SO  2  Py compared to more traditional carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups is essential to override the otherwise more favourable competitive intramolecular C&#8208;H amination. The d&#8208;site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5&#8208;membered cyclopalladation at competitive g&#8208;CH  2  . Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity</dc:description>

The d-site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5-membered cyclopalladation at competitive g-CH  2  . Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo- and regioselectivity&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Mechanisms of Fluorophores Employed in Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decoding cellular processes requires visualization of spatial distribution and dynamic interactions of biomolecules. It is therefore not surprising that innovations in imaging technologies have facilitated advances in biomedical research. The advent of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies has empowered biomedical researchers with the ability to answer long&#8208;standing questions about cellular processes at an entirely new level. Fluorescent probes greatly enhance the specificity and resolution of super&#8208;resolution imaging experiments. Here, we introduce key super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies, with a brief discussion on single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We evaluate the chemistry and photochemical mechanisms of fluorescent probes employed in SMLM. This review provides guidance on the identification and adoption of fluorescent probes in single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and inspire the designs for next&#8208;generation fluorescent probes amenable to single&#8208;molecule imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Peptide Multi&#8208;Macrocyclizations at the Surface of a Helical Foldamer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of different macrocycles can be implemented using Cys residues within a peptide and chloroacetamides at the surface of a foldamer helix by placing the latter at precise locations. Helix rigidity and faster formation of smaller macrocycles make the favored product largely predictable.







Abstract
Hybrid sequences comprising a peptide with several Cys residues and an aromatic foldamer helix with several chloroacetamide functions at its surface were synthesized. Such products may in principle form numerous macromulticyclic thioether products by intramolecularly combining all Cys residues and all chloroacetamide functions. However, we show that the reactive sites on the structurally defined helix can be placed at such locations that the peptide selectively stitches itself to form a series of different macrocycles within mostly one preferred product. Reactions were monitored by HPLC and products with two, three or four macrocycles were identified using LC&#8211;MS and NMR. The series of selective macrocyclizations define a sort of reaction trail where reaction sites otherwise identical are involved successively because of their precise positioning in space. The trails can be predicted to a large extent based on structural considerations and the assumption that smaller macrocycles form faster.

         <title>Regulating Surface Reaction Kinetics through Ligand Field Effects for Fast and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The boron acid additive can alleviate the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction by modulating the solvation sheath. The formed solvation structure with moderate ligand field strength enables fast and highly reversible Zn deposition.







Abstract
Designing water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath of Zn2+ by ligand substitution is a widely used strategy to protect Zn metal anode, yet the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the side hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a huge challenge. Herein, we find boric acid (BA) with moderate ligand field interaction can partially replace H2O molecules in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, forming a stable water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath. It enables fast Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and substantially suppressed HER. Crucially, by systematically comparing the ligand field strength and solvation energies between BA and the ever&#8208;reported electrolyte additives, we also find that the solvation energy has a strong correlation with Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and HER inhibition ability, displaying a classic volcano behavior. The modulation map could provide valuable insights for solvation sheath design of zinc batteries and beyond.

         <title>Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining Using Chemometric Methods: A Need for Chemists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining: Large and complex chemical data sets generated by modern analytical technologies have led to the so&#8208;called Big (Bio)Chemical Data era. These data sets can be produced using modern analytical instruments such as multi&#8208;dimensional chromatography, high&#8208;resolution and multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging and DNA/RNA microarrays. Chemometric methods have shown potential to analyze BBCD especially in omics sciences and chemical toxicology/drug discovery.







Abstract
This Review summarizes how big (bio)chemical data (BBCD) can be analyzed with multivariate chemometric methods and highlights some of the important challenges faced by modern analytical researches. Here, the potential of chemometric methods to solve BBCD problems that are being encountered in chromatographic, spectroscopic and hyperspectral imaging measurements will be discussed, with an emphasis on their applications to omics sciences. In addition, insights and perspectives on how to address the analysis of BBCD are provided along with a discussion of the procedures necessary to obtain more reliable qualitative and quantitative results. In this Review, the importance of &#8220;big data&#8221; and of their relevance to (bio)chemistry are first discussed. Thereafter, analytical tools which can produce BBCD are presented as well as the theoretical background of chemometric methods and their limitations when they are applied to BBCD. Finally, the importance of chemometric methods for the analysis of BBCD in different chemical disciplines is highlighted with some examples. In this work, we have tried to cover many of the current applications of big data analysis in the (bio)chemistry field.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Excited Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Silyl&#8208;Radical&#8208;Mediated Direct Activation of Carbamoyl Chlorides To Access (Hetero)aryl Carbamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcited nickel catalysis enabled silyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of carbamoyl chlorides. This process provides an operationally simple and widely applicable amidation reaction of a plethora of aryl and hetero(aryl) halides. Mechanistic understanding suggests that the reaction involves an energy&#8208;transfer mechanism for aryl bromide; while a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is operating for aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Amide bonds connect the amino acids in proteins and exist as a prevalent structural motif in biomolecules. Herein, we have exploited the concept of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling by merging the photo&#8208;redox and transition&#8208;metal catalysis to construct carbamides from superabundant (hetero)aryl halides along with commercially feasible carbamoyl chlorides. The success of this method relies on the prior formation of NiII&#8208;aryl halide intermediates, which involves in a photoexcited Ni&#8208;halide homolysis event by energy transfer from aryl bromide and single&#8208;electron transfer from aryl chloride to assist generation of the vital carbamoyl radical. The breadth of application of this technique is demonstrated both in inter&#8208; as well as intramolecular routes for the synthesis of a plethora of (hetero)aryl carbamides with diverse functionalities, and biologically important benzolactams.

Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxyhalogenation of unactivated internal alkynes is facilitated by a structurally tuned bidentate directing auxiliary, providing rapid access to tetrasubstitued alkenes that can be further diversified into valuable products.







Abstract
A catalytic 1,2&#8208;oxyhalogenation method that converts non&#8208;conjugated internal alkynes into tetrasubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is described. Mechanistically, the reaction involves a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle that begins with a directed oxypalladation step. The origin of regioselectivity is the preference for formation of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate, which is facilitated by an N,N&#8208;bidentate 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isopropyl (PIP) amide directing group. Selectivity for C(alkenyl)&#8722;X versus &#8722;N (X=halide) reductive elimination from the PdIV center depends on the identity of the halide anion; bromide and iodide engage in C(alkenyl)&#8722;X formation, while intramolecular C(alkenyl)&#8722;N reductive elimination occurs with chloride to furnish a lactam product. DFT calculations shed light on the origins of this phenomenon.

         <title>Boosting Bismuth(III) Complexation for Targeted &#945;&#8208;Therapy (TAT) Applications with the Mesocyclic Chelating Agent AAZTA

[Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; and derivatives have been comprehensively characterized. Fast formation, remarkable stability, strong accumulation in AR42J tumour make 213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; an outstanding candidate for TAT.







Abstract
Targeted &#945; therapy (TAT) is a promising tool in the therapy of cancer. The radionuclide 213BiIII shows favourable physical properties for this application, but the fast and stable chelation of this metal ion remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the mesocyclic chelator AAZTA quickly coordinates BiIII at room temperature, leading to a robust complex. A comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of [Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; is reported, along with bifunctional [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;COO&#8722;)]2&#8722; and the targeted agent [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;, which incorporates the SSR agonist Tyr3&#8208;octreotate. An unexpected increase in the stability and kinetic inertness of the metal chelate was observed for the bifunctional derivative and was maintained for the peptide conjugate. A cyclotron&#8208;produced 205/206Bi mixture was used as a model of 213Bi in labelling, stability, and biodistribution experiments, allowing the efficiency of [213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; to be estimated. High accumulation in AR42J tumours and reduced kidney uptake were observed with respect to the macrocyclic chelate [213Bi(DOTA&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Polymers via Coordination Post&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers was prepared using soluble and well&#8208;defined MOPs as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks. The introduction of MOPs constructs a coordination dynamic network that not only enhances mechanical properties but also realizes multifunctionality including self&#8208;healing, shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. CHMOPs provide a novel platform for expansion of the smart soft materials.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks with reversible and dynamic characteristics are gaining increasing interest in diverse application fields. Herein, we use a coordination crosslinking approach using metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks to post&#8208;assemble a class of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers. The introduction of 12&#8208;connected MOP nodes to the polymeric networks is critical to producing membranes that overcome the trade&#8208;off between mechanical properties and dynamic healing, and meanwhile possess multifunctionalities including shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. The CHMOPs can also be used for anticorrosion coating and achieve function couplings, e.g., shape memory&#8208;assisted self&#8208;healing (SMASH), which have not been achieved in the MOP&#8208;based hybrid materials yet. This work not only offers a feasible strategy to construct new multifunctional materials but also greatly expands the application scopes of MOPs.

         <title>Substrate Tumbling in a Chemisorbed Diastereomeric &#945;&#8208;Ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;Naphthyl)ethylamine Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
Guided by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and adsorption forces, an &#945;&#8208;ketoester tumbles between two prochiral states in a chemisorbed diastereomeric complex.







Abstract
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for &#945;&#8208;ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine complexes on Pt(111) reveal a tumbling motion that couples two neighboring binding states. The interconversion, resulting in prochiral inversion of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester, occurs in single complexes without breaking them apart. This is a surprising observation because the overall motion requires rotation of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester away from the surface without branching exclusively into diffusion away from the complex or desorption. The multi&#8208;step interconversion is rationalized in terms of sequences of bound states that combine transient H&#8208;bond interactions with the chiral molecule and weakened adsorption interactions with the metal. The observation of tumbling in single long&#8208;lived complexes is of relevance to self&#8208;assembly and directed molecular motion on surfaces, to ligand&#8208;controlled surface reactions, and most directly to stereocontrol in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Conservation of Nickel Ion Single&#8208;Active Site Character in a Bottom&#8208;Up Constructed &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecular Network</title>

The on&#8208;surface synthesis of covalent nickel tetraphenylporphyrin network on Au(111) is studied by a multitechnique approach combining local microscopic insights with space&#8208;averaging synchrotron radiation&#8208;based methods. Even though the porphyrin nanomesh is not perfectly ordered extending the &#960;&#8208;system results in the appearance of energy&#8208;dispersive electronic features while the Ni cores remain in the characteristic single&#8208;molecule configuration.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemistry holds the potential for ultimate miniaturization of functional devices. Porphyrins are promising building&#8208;blocks in exploring advanced nanoarchitecture concepts. More stable molecular materials of practical interest with improved charge transfer properties can be achieved by covalently interconnecting molecular units. On&#8208;surface synthesis allows to construct extended covalent nanostructures at interfaces not conventionally available. Here, we address the synthesis and properties of covalent molecular network composed of interconnected constituents derived from halogenated nickel tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(111). We report that the &#960;&#8208;extended two&#8208;dimensional material exhibits dispersive electronic features. Concomitantly, the functional Ni cores retain the same single&#8208;active site character of their single&#8208;molecule counterparts. This opens new pathways when exploiting the high robustness of transition metal cores provided by bottom&#8208;up constructed covalent nanomeshes.

         <title>Conferring BiVO4 Nanorods with Oxygen Vacancies to Realize Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoetching can confer BiVO4 with oxygen vacancies and enhance the catalytic performance of BiVO4. The photoetched BiVO4 can catalyze water splitting to generate oxygen and hydroxyl radicals under the mediation of ultrasound. The generated oxygen can relieve tumor hypoxia, thereby improving the sonodynamic cancer therapy performance of BiVO4.







Abstract
Owing to the high depth of tissue penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown broad application prospects for tumor treatment. However, the electron&#8208;hole separation inefficiency of sonosensitizers and the tumor hypoxia remain two major challenges limiting the effect of SDT. Here, ultrafine photoetched bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanorods modified with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 (PEBVO@PEG NRs) were fabricated to achieve in situ self&#8208;supply of oxygen (O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for hypoxic tumor therapy. The photoetching approach could enhance the charge separation by inducing enriched oxygen vacancies on the surface of BiVO4, thereby improving the generation efficiency of ROS and O2. The PEBVO@PEG overcome the main obstacles of traditional sonosensitizers in the SDT process and show promising sonodynamic therapeutic effects, thus providing new strategies for improving the performance of sonosensitizer and hypoxic tumor elimination.

         <title>Direct Acquisition of the Gap Height of Biological Tissue&#8208;Electronic Chemical Sensor Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of nanopores was integrated at the electrochemical sensor plane and used to measuring the ion conductance between them providing a versatile strategy to directly determine the gap height during exocytotic release from tissues. Direct cooperative measurement of the gap height and exocytotic release at the same sensor can be used to address the long&#8208;term question of the influence of diffusional filtering on the exocytotic spike.







Abstract
Interfacing biological tissues with electronic sensors offers the exciting opportunity to accurately investigate multiple biological processes. Accurate signal collection and application are the foundation of these measurements, but a long&#8208;term issue is the signal distortion resulting from the interface gap. The height of the gap is the key characteristic needed to evaluate or model the distortion, but it is difficult to measure. By integrating a pair of nanopores at the electronic sensor plane and measuring the ion conductance between them, we developed a versatile and straightforward strategy to realize the direct cooperative evaluation of the gap height during exocytotic release from adrenal gland tissues. The signaling distortion of this gap has been theoretically evaluated and shows almost no influence on the amperometric recording of exocytosis in a classic &#8220;semi&#8208;artificial synapse&#8221; configuration. This strategy should benefit research concerning various bio/chemical/machine interfaces.

         <title>Regioselective Access to Vicinal Diamines by Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitized Amidylimination of Alkenes with Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, photosensitized regioselective diamination of alkene is reported. The keys to this advance are: 1)&#8197;rational design of bifunctional diamination reagent, 2)&#8197;simultaneous generation of long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical with significantly differed reactivities, and 3)&#8197;involvement of photoinduced energy transfer reaction mode.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free photosensitized protocol for regioselective diamination of alkene feedstocks over a single step was developed based on the rationally designed bifunctional diamination reagent, thus affording a range of differentially protected 1,2&#8208;diamines in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction is initiated with a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone catalyst and diamination reagent, followed by fragmentation to simultaneously generate long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical. The excellent regioselectivity presumably stems from the large reactivity difference between two different N&#8208;centered radical species. This protocol is characterized by excellent regioselectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions, which would enrich the diversity and versatility of facilitate the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diamine&#8208;containing complex molecule scaffolds.

         <title>Ultrastable Anti&#8208;Acid &#8220;Shield&#8221; in Layered Silver Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid resistance (12&#8197;M HCl) was made possible for two isomorphic two&#8208;dimensional silver&#8208;based coordination polymers. Protection is provided by a hydrophobic organic shell and a dynamic proton buffer layer via a thiolate&#8208;thione tautomerism of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole ligands. Thus, these ligands are promising surface inhibitors, acting as a dual protective shield against metal corrosion.







Abstract
Surface passivation technology provides noble&#8208;metal materials with limited chemical stability, especially under highly acidic condition. To design effective strategy to enhance stability of noble&#8208;metal particles, an understanding of their surface anticorrosion mechanism at the atomic level is desirable by using two&#8208;dimensional (2D) noble&#8208;metal coordination polymer (CP) as an ideal model for their interfacial region. With the protection of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole (TBI), we isolated two Ag&#8208;based 2D CPs, {Ag14(TBI)12X2}n (S&#8722;X, where S denotes sheet and X=Cl or Br). These compounds exhibited excellent chemical stability upon immersion in various common solvents, boiling water, boiling ethanol, 10&#8201;% hydrogen peroxide, concentrated acid (12&#8197;M HCl), and concentrated alkali (19&#8197;M NaOH). Systematic characterization and DFT analyses demonstrate that the superior stability of S&#8722;X was attributed to the hydrophobic organic shell and dynamic proton buffer layer acting as a double protective &#8220;shield&#8221;.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Poly(Imine&#8208;Carbonate) Derived from Plastic Waste and Bio&#8208;based Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling of polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) with a bio&#8208;based vanillin derivative into novel dialdehyde monomer DVEC is shown. DVEC was further polymerized by using primary amines into high&#8208;performance poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s. These modular polymers are reprocessable and chemically recyclable under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions, thereby enabling a closed&#8208;loop recycling scheme.







Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers represents the key technology to convert plastic waste in a sustainable fashion. Efficient chemical recycling and upcycling strategies are thus highly sought&#8208;after to establish a circular plastic economy. Here, we present the selective chemical depolymerization of polycarbonate by employing a vanillin derivative as bio&#8208;based feedstock. The resulting di&#8208;vanillin carbonate monomer was used in combination with various amines to construct a library of reprocessable poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s, which show tailor&#8208;made thermal and mechanical properties. These novel poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s exhibit excellent recyclability under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions. This allows the recovery of monomers in high yields and purity for immediate reuse, even when mixed with various commodity plastics. This work provides exciting new insights in the design of bio&#8208;based circular polymers produced by upcycling of plastic waste with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>Orthogonal Charge Transfer by Precise Positioning of Silver Single Atoms and Clusters on Carbon Nitride for Efficient Piezocatalytic Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;C2N2 single&#8208;sites and Ag clusters are co&#8208;confined on carbon nitride (CN). The enhanced in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization by Ag single atoms and rapid out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transfer between Ag clusters and CN collectively contribute to the excellent piezocatalytic pure water splitting.







Abstract
Developing efficient piezocatalytic systems for two&#8208;electron water splitting (TEWS) with producing H2 and H2O2 shows great promise to meet the industrial demand. Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co&#8208;anchored on carbon nitride (AgSA+C&#8722;CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, AgSA+C&#8722;CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain. Consequently, a superior H2 and H2O2 evolution rate of 7.90&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 5.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 is delivered by AgSA+C&#8722;CN, respectively, far exceeding that of the previously reported piezocatalysts. This work not only presents the SAs decoration as an available polarization enhancement strategy, but also sheds light on the superiority of multi&#8208;sites engineering in piezocatalysis.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Material Based on Cross&#8208;Linking&#8208;Induced Emission: Applications in Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptable strategy toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior was developed. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.







Abstract
A versatile strategy for smart fluorescent materials is lacking due to their diverse responding mechanisms and incompatibility of responsive behaviors. Herein an adaptable strategy is presented toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior by blending linear polymers modified with different stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties and AIE cross&#8208;linker. Under stimuli, the linear polymer can cross&#8208;link with the cross&#8208;linker to form networks, which intrinsically restrict the intramolecular rotation of the AIE molecule to induce strong emission. A unified stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is involved in that various stimuli are transferred through the organized &#8220;stimulus&#8208;crosslink&#8208;emission&#8221; process. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.

         <title>Salting&#8208;Out Aldehyde from the Electrooxidation of Alcohols with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes has significant challenges, for example, it cannot realize the preparation of aldehydes selectively in alkaline aqueous solutions. By tuning the local microenvironment over the electrocatalyst, and thus selectively salting&#8208;out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface, the electrocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes was achieved in an efficient and green way.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehydes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to its higher reactivity than alcohol, the aldehyde is easily over&#8208;oxidized to acid in alkaline electrolytes. Herein we realize the selective electrooxidation of alcohol to aldehyde on NiO by tuning the local microenvironment to salt out the aldehyde from the reaction system. The origin of the high selectivity was found to be the inhibition of the hydration of aldehydes, which is the result of the decreased alkalinity and the increased cation and substrate concentration. This strategy could salt out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface from the electrooxidation of alcohol with 100&#8201;% selectivity and be easily extended to other selective oxidation reactions, such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxaldehyde (DFF) and amine to an imine.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxycarbonylation of Alkyl Bromides via a Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct alkoxycarbonylation pattern via an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; catalyst is reported. This low&#8208;valent iron catalyst activates alkyl halides via a two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, unlike previous reports where alkyl halides underwent a single electron transfer (SET). This reaction provides easy and efficient access to esters, and its mechanism will provide new ideas for the activation of alkyl halides in the field of carbonylation.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are some of the most widely used methods in organic synthesis. However, despite the obvious advantages of iron as an abundant and low toxicity transition metal catalyst, its practical application in carbonylation reaction remains largely unexplored. Here we report our recent study on Fe&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is catalyzed by an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; complex. This low&#8208;valent iron species activates alkyl bromides via a distinctive two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, whereas it proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) process for alkyl iodides which is consistent with literature.

         <title>sp2 to sp3 Hybridization Transformation in Ionic Crystals under Unprecedentedly Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation in ionic crystals, the realization of internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic groups to covalent groups is proposed. It is demonstrated in a crystal of LiBO2 which undergoes the transformation at unprecedentedly low pressure of only 2.85&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Under cold pressure sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation has been exclusively observed in covalent or molecular crystals overwhelmingly above &#8776;10&#8197;GPa, and the approaches to lower the transition pressure are limited on external heat&#8208;treatment and/or catalyzers. Herein we demonstrate that, by internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic to covalent groups, the transformation can be significantly prompted, as shown in a crystal of LiBO2 under 2.85&#8197;GPa for the first case in ionic crystals. This unprecedentedly low transformation pressure is ascribed to the enhanced localized stress on covalent B&#8722;O frames transferred from ionic Li&#8722;O bonds in LiBO2, and accordingly the corresponding structural feature is summarized. This work provides an internal structural regulation strategy for pressure&#8208;reduction of the s&#8208;p orbital hybridization transformation and extends the sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 transformation landscape from molecular and covalent compounds to ionic systems.

         <title>Rationally Designing Efficient Electrocatalysts for Direct Seawater Splitting: Challenges, Achievements, and Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides an overview of electrocatalysts designed for the direct splitting of seawater. The mechanism of seawater splitting is introduced before the primary principles for designing catalysts (noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free) for seawater splitting are analyzed in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The future development of electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen generation is also discussed.







Abstract
Directly splitting seawater to produce hydrogen provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. However, current seawater splitting faces many challenges because of the sluggish kinetics, the presence of impurities, membrane contamination, and the competitive chloride oxidation reaction at the anode, which makes it more difficult than freshwater splitting. This Review firstly introduces the basic mechanisms of the anode and cathode reactions during seawater splitting. We critically analyze the primary principles for designing catalysts for seawater splitting in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, including with noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free catalysts. Strategies to design effective catalysts, such as active site population, synergistic effect regulation, and surface engineering, are discussed. Furthermore, promises, perspectives, and challenges in developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Accessibility and Reproducibility of Worm&#8208;like Micelles by In Situ Crosslinking Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greatly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles (W) is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), leading to significantly improved reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles. The reliability of the methodology has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems with different formulations of monomers, macro RAFT agents, crosslinkers, solvents, and polymerization temperatures.







Abstract
Worm&#8208;like micelles have attracted great interest due to their anisotropic structures. However, the experimental conditions for obtaining worm&#8208;like micelles are very restricted, which usually causes seriously poor reproducibility. In this work, significantly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is greatly improved due to the significantly enlarged experimental windows of worm&#8208;like micelles in the morphology diagram. Moreover, the reliability of the methodology to enhance the accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems. The greatly enhanced accessibility and reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is undoubtedly cost&#8208;effective especially in scale&#8208;up production, which paves the way for further application of worm&#8208;like micelles with various compositions and functionalities.

         <title>Surface Diffusion Aided by a Chirality Change of Self&#8208;Assembled Oligomers under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new functional molecular system with a combination of several advanced features, including a self&#8208;assembled oligomer, surface chirality, chirality switching, and finally their motion on the surface. Our results suggest that nonchiral molecules may be designed to induce switchable enantiomeric surface assemblies, relevant for heterogeneous catalysts.







Abstract
Chirality switching of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures is of potential interest for designing functional materials but is restricted by the strong interaction between the embedded molecules. Here, we report on an unusual approach based on reversible chirality changes of self&#8208;assembled oligomers using variable&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations. Six functionalized diazomethanes each self&#8208;assemble into chiral wheel&#8208;shaped oligomers on Ag(111). At 130&#8197;K, a temperature far lower than expected, the oligomers change their chirality even though the molecules reside in an embedded self&#8208;assembled structure. Each chirality change is accompanied by a slight center&#8208;of&#8208;mass shift. We show how the identical activation energies of the two processes result from the interplay of the chirality change with surface diffusion, findings that open the possibility of implementing various functional materials from self&#8208;assembled supramolecular structures.

         <title>An Atypical Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Enables Efficient Biosynthesis of Extender Units for Engineering a Polyketide Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (ACS, UkaQ) with broad substrate specificity and an unusual catalytic mode was identified. Its stability and catalytic activity were remarkably improved by protein engineering, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs. In combination with permissive carboxylases, diverse extender units were synthesized and used to engineer the polyketide carbon scaffold of antimycin.







Abstract
Acyl&#8208;CoAs are key precursors of primary and secondary metabolism. Their efficient biosynthesis is often impeded by the limited substrate specificity and low in vivo activity of acyl&#8208;CoA synthetases (ACSs) due to regulatory acylation of the catalytically important lysine residue in motif A10 (Lys&#8208;A10). In this study, we identified an unusual ACS (UkaQ) from the UK&#8208;2A biosynthetic pathway that naturally lacks the Lys&#8208;A10 residue and exhibits extraordinarily broad substrate specificity. Protein engineering significantly improved its stability and catalytic activity, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs with highly robust activity. By combining it with permissive carboxylases, we produced a large array of polyketide extender units and obtained six novel halobenzyl&#8208;containing antimycin analogues through an engineered biosynthetic pathway. This study significantly expands the catalytic mode of ACSs and provides a potent tool for the biosynthesis of acyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived natural products.

         <title>Programmable Assembly of Multivalent DNA&#8208;Protein Superstructures for Tumor Imaging and Targeted Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multivalent DNA nanomaterials are designed through the biomimetic assembly of DNA with Food and Drug Administration&#8208;approved protamine, providing biocompatible and stable drug carriers with high avidity in a simpler method. This practical approach achieves sensitive tumor imaging and targeted cancer therapy, and offers new clinical translation opportunities.







Abstract
Programmable DNA materials hold great potential in biochemical and biomedical researches, yet the complicated synthesis, and the low stability and targeting efficacy in complex biological milieu limit their clinical translations. Here we show a one&#8208;pot assembly of DNA&#8208;protein superstructures as drug vehicles with specifically high affinity and stability for targeted therapy. This is achieved by biomimetic assembly of programmable polymer DNA wire into densely packed DNA nanosphere with an alkaline protein, protamine. Multivalent DNA nanostructures encoded with different types and densities of aptamers exhibit high affinity to targeted cells through polyvalent interaction. Our results show high cancer cell selectivity, reduced side effect, excellent therapeutic efficacy, and sensitive tumor imaging in both subcutaneous and orthotopic non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer murine models. This biomimetic assembly approach provides practical DNA nanomaterials for further clinical trials and may advance oligonucleotide drug delivery.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;heterolepticity in Low&#8208;Symmetry Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages are prized for their structural complexity and multi&#8208;functionality. Controlling integrative self&#8208;sorting processes necessary to achieve defined self&#8208;assembly of these supramolecular hosts is a significant design challenge. In this work, ligand&#8208;tethering strategies are described that allow access to metal&#8208;organic cages with highly anisotropic cavities described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand scaffolds.







Abstract
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages, formed through integrative self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, are highly attractive as reduced symmetry supramolecular hosts. Ensuring high&#8208;fidelity, non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly, however, presents a significant challenge in molecular engineering due to the inherent difficulty in predicting thermodynamic energy landscapes. In this work, two conceptual strategies are described that circumvent this issue, using ligand design strategies to access structurally sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts. Using these approaches, it was possible to realise cavity environments described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand frameworks, representing a significant step forward in the construction of highly anisotropic confined spaces.

         <title>Unraveling the Complex Chirality Evolution in DNA&#8208;Assembled High&#8208;Order, Hybrid Chiroplasmonic Superstructures from Multi&#8208;Scale Chirality Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;scale chirality evolution was observed from DNA&#8208;assembled hybrid chiroplasmonic superstructures comprised of metal nanoparticles and organic chromophores, as a result of distinct fundamental chiral interactions at different hierarchical levels. The findings present new challenges to current theoretical frameworks to describe chiral hybrid systems, thus will motivate the related computational and theoretical advances.







Abstract
Hierarchical, chiral hybrid superstructures of chromophores and nanoparticles are expected to give rise to intriguing unveiled chiroptical responses originating from the complex chiral interactions among the components. Herein, DNA origami cavity that could self&#8208;assemble into one&#8208;dimensional (1D) DNA tubes was employed as a scaffold to accurately organize metal nanoparticles and chromophores. The chiral interactions were studied at the level of individual hybrid particles and their 1D hybrid superstructures. Complex chirality mechanisms involving global structural chirality, plasmon&#8208;induced circular dichroism (PICD) and exciton&#8208;coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) were disentangled. The multiplexed CD spectrum superposition revealed the chirality evolution at different length scales. These results can offer a model for boosting the theoretical understanding of classical&#8208;quantum hybrid systems, and would inspire the future design of optically&#8208;active substances across length scales.

         <title>Pt Atoms/Clusters on Ni&#8208;phytate&#8208;sensitized Carbon Nitride for Enhanced NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven Overall Water Splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm</title>

         <dc:description>
A NIR light&#8208;driven photocatalyst for overall water splitting was constructed by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven overall water splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm remains a high&#8208;priority target yet great challenge. Here we report that efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons in a photosensitized system prepared by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The optimal catalyst presents simultaneous hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution with an H2 evolution amount of 1.4&#8197;&#956;mol at &#955;&gt;800&#8197;nm for 24&#8197;hours, which its activity was approximately 140&#8197;times higher than that of a system without Pt&#8208;SAC modification (PA&#8208;Ni1.1@PCN). This work represents the first NIR&#8208;light responsive photosensitized system for overall water splitting, and may open an avenue for precisely manipulating cocatalyst positions at the atomic level to improve NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting via photosensitization.

         <title>Double&#8208;pronged Antimicrobial Agents based on a Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Type Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel antibacterial agents are urgently needed to control the infections induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. Herein, we rationally designed and facilely synthesized a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type luminogen with strong red/near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission, great aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, and excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The newly developed molecule TTTh killed the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by triggering the ROS accumulation in bacteria and interrupting the membrane integrity. Moreover, TTTh specifically targeted the lysosomes and potentiated their maturation to accelerate the clearance of intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reduced bacterial burden and improved healing were observed in TTTh&#8208;treated wounds with negligible side effects. Our study expands the biological design and application of AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and provides new insights into discovering novel antibacterial targets and agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Charge Separation in Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) Imides with Semi&#8208;coherent Interfaces for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of heterojunctions is a promising manner to accelerate the separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface. Herein, a binary poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides (PHI/PTI) with semi&#8208;coherent interfaces was fabricated via a facile two&#8208;step salt&#8208;melt synthetic process. The built&#8208;in electric fields at the semi&#8208;coherent interface endow prompt exciton splitting and charge carrier separation. Hence, the optimized PHI/PTI&#8208;based copolymer presents a high apparent quantum yield (AQY=64%) for visible&#8208;light driven hydrogen production, by the aids of K  2  HPO  4  as charge transfer mediator. This study provides physical insights for the rational promotion of the photocatalytic performance from the viewpoint of interfacial engineering of photocatalytic junctions on crystalline carbon nitride based semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing luminescence lifetime sensor in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window is a great challenge due to the difficult structural construction. Here, we report a tumor redox responsive and easy synthesized material, amorphous manganese oxide (MnO  x  ) with indirect bandgap of 1.02 eV as energy acceptor to build a luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) toolbox for universally regulating NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide nanoparticles, in which energy transfer is based on matched energy gap instead of conventional overlapped spectra. We further utilize Yb  3+  doped YbNP@MnO  x  as NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime sensor to realize  in vitro  quantitative redox visualization with relative errors under 5% after mouse skin coverage. Furthermore, HepG2 cells and tumors with high redox state have been accurately distinguished by NIR&#8208;II luminescence lifetime imaging. The quantified intracellular and intratumoral glutathione (GSH) levels are highly consistent with the commercial kit results, illustrating the reliable redox visualization ability under bio&#8208;tissue.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear Axially Chiral Conjugated Polymers Exhibiting Ultralong Low&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence and Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), as two important branches in the field of organic optical functional materials have broad prospects. In this work, a pair of novel conjugated polymers with low&#8208;temperature UOP and intense CPL properties are constructed by incorporating rigid axially chiral chromophores into polymeric backbone. The twisted and rigid biphenyl skeleton not only effectively reduce the energy gap between the S  1  and T to greatly facilitate the intersystem crossing process, but also suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay from T  1  to S  0  . As a result, a strong and ultralong afterglow of up to 33 s is achieved in 2&#8208;MeTHF at 77K. Moreover, the repeating rigid biphenyl skeleton with helix&#8208;like form also promotes the chiroptical activity of the polymers, and the intense signals are shown in low&#8208;temperature CPL spectra with absolute  g  lum  values of 9.7&#215;10  &#8208;3  and 5.8&#215;10  &#8208;3  at the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission peak, respectively. This work represents the first low&#8208;temperature materials with UOP and CPL property, which provides a new guideline and perspective for the development of persistent luminescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Oligopeptides by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Radical Addition to Dehydroalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely overrides substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Controllable Nanoassemblies of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Abnormal Disassembly&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement for In Vivo Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been widely observed for luminophors but it causes emission decrease after disassembly. The construction of unique nanoassemblies with disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (DIEE) is demanded. Herein, by taking advantages of alterable siloxane bridge crosslinking states, we report a facile strategy to fabricate water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with abnormal DIEE. The fabricated AuNP nanoassemblies with dominate interparticle crosslinking showed a redshifted emission at ~1070 nm with quantum yields (QYs) of 1.8%. After disassembly, the nanoassemblies with increased intraparticle crosslinking exhibited a unique DIEE (&gt;6 folds, QYs, 12%) due to the enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition. Besides, the disassembly facilitated renal clearance of AuNPs to reduce nonspecific body retention, opening new possibilities for designing highly&#8208;emissive renal&#8208;clearable nanostructures toward more bioapplications.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Co&#8208;assembly Pathway Induced Chirality Inversion along with Morphology Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway induced chirality inversion along with morphology transition is of importance to understand the biological processes, but still remains a challenge to be realized in artificial systems. Herein, the helical nanofibers consisting of phenylalanine&#8208;based enantiomers (L/DPF) successfully transform into kinetically trapped architectures with opposite helicity via kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway. By contrast, the co&#8208;assemblies obtained via thermodynamic pathway exhibit non&#8208;helical structures. The formation sequence of non&#8208;covalent interactions plays a crucial role in structural chirality of co&#8208;assemblies. For the kinetic pathway, the hydrogen bonding between D/LPF and naphthylamide derivatives forms before &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking to facilitate the formation of helical structures with inverse handedness. This study may provide a methodology to explore chirality inversion accompanied with morphology transition by manipulating kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#160;Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of CO  2  &#160;by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers&#160;a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO  2  &#160;hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11 vol.%&#160;under 30 bar (CO  2  :H  2  &#160;= 1:3) at 170  o  C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water,&#160;the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1%, meanwhile the conversion of CO  2  &#160;underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO  2  /intermediates,&#160;facilitating&#160;the transformation of COOH* and CH  2  O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO  via  &#160;water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Distal Fe3+&#8208;sited Hetero&#8208;atomic Pairs Boosting Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous efforts regarding the hetero&#8208;atomic interaction have been investigated over the past decades, due to their heterogeneity, their individual roles among various atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, a facilely&#8208;synthesized electrocatalyst with distal Fe3+&#8208;sited hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined onto a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate is validated to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.1 s&#8208;1 at 300 mV under alkaline environment. Through systematically operando characterization, Lewis acidic Fe3+ at the distal site in Co&#8208;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pair is clarified to boost a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. Furthermore, significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer in pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance for Co&#8208;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pairs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational utilization of the rich light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay taking place in single&#8208;cell analysis is debuting and represents a new technological direction in the arena. Light&#8208;fueled operation is expected to achieve advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) single&#8208;cell analysis with unknown possibilities. Here a PEC nanoreactor capable of single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background Faradic detection of intracellular microRNA (miR) is devised by construction of a small reaction chamber accommodating the target&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction for binding the metallointercalator of [Ru(bpy)  2  (dppz)]  2+  as the signal reporter. Light stimulation of the dsDNA/metallointercalator adduct will induce the generation of photocurrents, underpinning a zero&#8208;biased and near zero&#8208;background PEC methodology toward Faradic detection of non&#8208;electrogenic miR at single&#8208;cell level, and lower miR concentration in the near nucleus region than that in the main cytosol was revealed by this nanotool.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerisation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Graft Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of branching on polymer self&#8208;assembly is investigated by conducting polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of sparsely grafted poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) in n&#8208;dodecane. Electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray scattering techniques are used to characterise the resulting materials.







Abstract
We report the polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) copolymers during reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) grafting from polymerisation in a backbone&#8208;selective solvent. Electron microscopy images suggest the phase separation of grafts to result in a network of spherical particles, due to the ability of the branched architecture to freeze chain entanglements and to bridge core domains. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering data suggest the architecture promotes the formation of multicore micelles, the core morphology of which transitions from spheres to worms, vesicles, and inverted micelles with increasing volume fraction of the grafts. A time&#8208;resolved SAXS study is presented to illustrate the formation of the inverted phase during a polymerisation. The grafted architecture gives access to unusual morphologies and provides exciting new handles for controlling the polymer structure and material properties.

         <title>Terminal and Super&#8208;Basic Parent Imides of Hafnium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear parent hafnium imido complex prepared by reduction of the bisazide precursor, afforded a terminally bonded parent imide. DFT calculations revealed: Formation of parent imide proceeds via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido unit with a computed pKBH+ of ca. &#8764;57, followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of nearby benzyl group across the anionic Hf&#8801;N bond. Reactivity studies of the anionic HfNH moiety are also presented.







Abstract
A dinuclear hafnium complex containing the parent imido ligand [(PN)(PNC)Hf=NH{&#956;2&#8208;K}]2 (2) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2; PNC2&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;CH2Me2C6H2), was prepared by reduction of the bisazide trans&#8208;[(PN)2Hf(N3)2] (1) with two equiv of KC8. Encapsulation of K+ in 2 with crown&#8208;ether or cryptand affords the first discrete salt [K(encap)][(PN)(PNC)Hf&#8801;NH] (encap=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6(THF)2, 3; 2,2,2&#8208;Kryptofix, 4), featuring a terminal parent imide and possessing some of the shortest Hf&#8722;N bond lengths known to date. DFT calculations revealed formation of 2 to proceed via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido, [(PN)2Hf&#8801;N]&#8722;(A), having a computed pKBH+ of &#8764;57 followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of a benzylic methyl group across the Hf&#8801;N triple bond in A. An electronic structure analysis reveals A to possess a covalent Hf&#8801;N triple bond and of super&#8208;basic character. We also showcase reactivity of the Hf&#8801;NH bond with various electrophiles.

         <title>Electronic Materials: An Antiaromatic Propeller Made from the Four&#8208;Fold Fusion of Tetraoxa[8]circulene and Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of an antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene annulated with four perylene diimides (PDI),&#160; giving a dynamic non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, is described. The molecule contains 32 aromatic rings surrounding one formally antiaromatic planarized cyclooctatetraene (COT). The intense absorption (&#949; = 3.35 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) and emission bands are assigned to internal charge&#8208;transfer transitions in the combined PDI&#8208;circulene &#960;&#8208;system. The spectroscopic data is supported by density functional theory calculations, and nuclear independent chemical shift calculation indicate that the antiaromatic COT has increased aromaticity in the reduced state. Electrochemical studies show that the compound can reversibly reach the tetra&#8208; and octaanionic states by reduction of the four PDI units, and the decaanionic state by reduction of the central COT ring. The material functions effectively in bulk hetero junction solar cells as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, reaching a power conversion efficiency of 6.4 %.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Systemic 64 Membered Heparan Sulfate Tetrasaccharide Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) has multifaceted biological activities. To date, no libraries of HS oligosaccharides bearing systemically varied sulfation structures are available yet due to the challenges in synthesizing a large number of HS oligosaccharides. To overcome the obstacles and expedite the synthesis, a divergent approach was designed, where 64 HS tetrasaccharides covering all the possible structures of 2&#8208;  O  , 6&#8208;  O  and  N  &#8208; sulfations with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone were successfully produced from a  single  strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This extensive library helped identify the structural requirements for HS sequences to have strong fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 binding but weak affinity with platelet factor&#8208;4. This can provide a strategy to separate out these two interactions to obtain new HS based potential therapeutics   without the dangerous adverse effect of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia  .</dc:description>

In the present work, a unique approach for the challenging electrophilic Au&#8208;catalyzed  &#945;&#8208;  C&#8208;H bond functionalization of tertiary amines is presented. Electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects exerted by the use of a malonate unit in the substrate were key to the success of this transformation. This new reactivity was applied to the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products which, under oxidative conditions, could be converted into valuable structural motifs found in bioactive alkaloid natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework@Metal Oxide Heterostructures Induced by Electron&#8208;Beam Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a distinct family of crystalline porous materials finding extensive applications. Their synthesis often requires elevated temperature and relatively long reaction time. We report here the first case of MOF synthesis activated by high&#8208;energy (1.5 MeV) electron beam radiation from a commercially available electron&#8208;accelerator. Using ZIF&#8208;8 as a representative for demonstration, this type of synthesis can be accomplished under ambient conditions within minutes, leading to energy consumption about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solvothermal condition. Interestingly, by controlling the absorbed dose in the synthesis, the electron beam not only activates the formation reaction of ZIF&#8208;8, but also partially etches the material during the synthesis affording a hierarchical pore architecture and highly crystalline ZnO nanoparticles on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8. This gives rise to a new strategy to obtain MOF@metal oxide heterostructures, finding applications in photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Quadruple Borylation of Terminal Alkynes to Access sp3&#8208;Tetra&#8208;Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed regioselective quadruple borylation of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a copper catalyst generated from CuI and dcpe (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane). A wide range of terminal alkynes undergo this multi&#8208;borylation reaction to afford the corresponding 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraborylalkanes in high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that this quadruple borylation reaction proceeds through copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential double 1,2diborylation of alkynes and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkene intermediates. This protocol represents the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approach to prepare  sp3&#8208;tetra&#8208;organometallic reagents from readily accessible alkynes with commercially available copper catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Heme Peroxo Oxidants in the Rational Mechanistic Modeling of Nitric Oxide Synthase: Characterization of Key Intermediates and Elucidation of the Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mediates the two&#8208;step O2  &#8208;dependent oxidative degradation of arginine, and has been linked to a medley of disease situations in humans. Nonetheless, its exact mechanism of action still remains unclear. This work presents the first NOS model system where biologically proposed heme superoxo and peroxo intermediates are assessed as active oxidants against oxime substrates. Markedly, heme peroxo intermediates engaged in a bioinspired oxime oxidation reaction pathway, converting oximes to ketones and nitroxyl anions (NO&#8211;). Detailed thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations all evince a rate&#8208;limiting step primarily driven by the nucleophilicity of the heme peroxo moiety. Coherent with other findings,  18O and  15N isotope substitution experiments herein suffice compelling evidence toward a detailed mechanism, which draw close parallels to one of the enzymatic proposals. Intriguingly, recent enzymatic studies also lend credence to these findings, and several relevant reaction intermediates have been observed during NOS turnover.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Cluster Nanospheres in Water&#8208;Deficient Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key intermediate phase of crystalline calcium carbonate biominerals, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) remains mysterious in its structures because of its long&#8208;range disorder and instability. We herein report the synthesis of ACC nanospheres in a water&#8208;deficient organic solvent system. The obtained ACC nanospheres are very stable under dry conditions. Cryo&#8208;TEM reveals that each nanospheres consists of smaller nanosized clusters. We further demonstrate that these clusters can precipitate on other substrates to form an ultrathin ACC coating, which should be an ACC cluster monolayer. The results demonstrate that the presence of small ACC clusters as the subunits of larger aggregates is inherent to ACC synthesized in water&#8208;alcohol system but not induced by polymer additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Copper&#8208;Zinc Alloy Layer Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode of Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable surface modification layer is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions of Zinc (Zn) metal anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. Herein, a multicomponent Cu&#8208;Zn alloy interlayer with superior Zn affinity, high toughness and effective inhibition effect on lattice distortion is constructed on Zn foil (Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn) to fabricate ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode. Owning to the advantages of high binding energy of Cu&#8208;Zn alloy layer with Zn atoms and less contact area between metallic Zn and electrolyte, the as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn electrode not only restricts the aggregation of Zn atoms, but also suppresses the pernicious hydrogen evolution and corrosion, leading to homogeneous Zn deposition and outstanding electrochemical performances. Accordingly, the symmetric battery with Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn electrode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 5496 h at 1 mA cm  &#8722;2  for 1&#8201;mAh&#8201;cm  &#8722;2  , and the Cu&#8208;Zn@Zn//V  2  O  5  pouch cell demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88% after 600 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of the Specific Activity of M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs and the Intrinsic Activity of Tetrapyrrolic Fe&#8208;N4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>M&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts are considered pivotal to replace expensive precious group metal&#8208;based materials in electrocatalytic conversions. However, their development is hampered by the limited availability of methods for the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of different active sites, like pyrrolic Fe&#8208;N  4  sites within Fe&#8208;N&#8208;Cs. Currently, new synthetic procedures based on active&#8208;site imprinting followed by an ion exchange reaction, e.g. Zn&#8208;to&#8208;Fe, are producing single&#8208;site M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs with outstanding activity. Based on the same replacement principle, we employed a conservative iron extraction to partially remove the Fe ions from the N  4  cavities in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;Cs. Having catalysts with the same morphological properties and Fe ligation that differ solely in Fe content allows for the facile determination of the reduced density of active site and their turn&#8208;over frequency.&#160;In this way, insight into the specific activity of M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs is obtained and for single&#8208;site catalysts the intrinsic activity of the site is accessible. This new approach surpasses limitations of methods that rely on probe molecules and, together with those techniques, offers a novel tool to unfold the complexity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst and M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cinereain and (&#8211;)&#8208;Janoxepin through a Fragment Coupling/Retro&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8211;)&#8208;janoxepin, two fungal cyclotripeptides featuring a complex heterocyclic core and interesting phytotoxic and antimalarial activities, have been achieved in a convergent manner. A key step in this synthesis is a one pot cascade initiated by the cyclocondensation of two fragments&#8212;a hindered 2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;acyl fluoride and an electron deficient cyclic amidine&#8212;to release a reactive spiro[2&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1,5'&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;4',6'&#8208;dione]. This intermediate underwent a spontaneous retro&#8208;Claisen rearrangement that was rationalized by DFT calculations. The cascade directly afforded a 2,5&#8208;dihydrooxepin&#8208;fused heterotricyclic product. In addition, the challenging oxepin ring was finally forged by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination of an allylic fluoride intermediate. Beyond the development of these original transformations, this work contributes to the first achievement of the asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;cinereain and (&#8211;)&#8208;janoxepin.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Engineering toward Gold Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise gold nanoclusters provide great opportunities to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of nanogold catalysts. A nanocluster consists of a metal core and a surface ligand shell, both the core and shell have significant effects on catalytic properties. Thanks to their precise structures, the active metal site of the clusters can be readily identified and the ligand effects in catalysis can be disclosed. In this Minireview, we summarize recent advances in catalytic research of gold nanoclusters, emphasizing four strategies for constructing open metal sites, including post&#8208;treatment, bulky ligands strategy, surface geometric mismatch method and heteroatom doping protocol. We also discuss the ligand effects on catalytic activity, selectivity and stability of gold cluster catalysts. Finally, we present the future challenges with regard to gold cluster catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>FRET Monitoring of a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Elongation Module Reveals Carrier Protein Shuttling Between Catalytic Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) employ multiple domains, specifically arranged in modules, for an assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis of a plethora of bioactive peptides. It is poorly understood how catalysis is correlated with the domain interplay and associated conformational changes. We developed FRET sensors of an elongation module to study in solution the intramodular interactions of the peptidyl&#8208;carrier&#8208;protein (PCP) with adenylation (A) and condensation (C) domains. Backed by a HDX&#8208;MS analysis, we discovered dynamic mixtures of conformations that undergo distinct population changes in favor of the PCP&#8208;A and PCP&#8208;C interactions upon completion of the adenylation and thiolation reactions, respectively. To probe this model we blocked PCP binding to the C domain by photocaging and triggered peptide bond formation with light. Changing intramodular domain affinities of the PCP appear to result in conformational shifts according to the logic of the templated assembly process.</dc:description>

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luciferin is one of Nature&#8217;s most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to firefly&#8217;s luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst &#8211; luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin&#8217;s electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in&#8208;situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Twisted Carbazole&#8208;Fused DABNA Derivative as an Orange&#8208;Red TADF Emitter for OLEDs with Nearly 40% EQE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is currently a research hotspot in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high color purity and high exciton utilization. However, there are only a handful of MR&#8208;TADF emitters with emissions beyond the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. The very limited emission colors for MR&#8208;TADF emitters are mainly caused by the fact that so far molecular modifications of MR&#8208;TADF do not offer much change in the emission colors. Here, we report a new approach to modifying a prototypical MR core of DABNA by fusing carbazoles to the MR framework. The carbazole&#8208;fused molecule (TCZ&#8208;F&#8208;DABNA) basically maintains the MR&#8208;dominated features of DABNA while red&#8208;shifting the emission. Its OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 39.2% with a peak at 588 nm, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for OLEDs with peaks beyond 560 nm. This work provides a new approach for significantly tunning emission colors of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;P bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful tool for the formation of both C&#8208;C and C&#8208;P bond. However, the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8208;P bond is still undeveloped. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective cleavage of C&#8208;P bond for the construction of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines and stereogenic axis. This protocol enables the quick synthesis of atropisomers bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center in high yields, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of up to 98% ee, &gt;25:1 dr. The product is able to serve as chiral catalyst in phosphine catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of allenoates to imines, showing the great potential of the present methodology.</dc:description>

Increasing the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers downshifted the band position in a new carbon nitride that promoted water oxidation kinetics while avoiding thermodynamic photoreduction of H2. The material showed competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% for overall H2O2 production under normoxic conditions and record high activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1) for high&#8208;performance hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Artificial photocatalysis offers a clean approach for producing H2O2. However, the poor selectivity and activity of H2O2 production hamper traditional industrial applications and emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we report a C5N2 photocatalyst with a conjugated C=N linkage for selective and efficient non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 production in both normoxic and hypoxic systems. The strengthened delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers in C5N2 downshifted the band position, thermodynamically eliminating side H2 evolution reaction and kinetically promoting water oxidation. As a result, C5N2 had a competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% in overall H2O2 production and exhibited by far the highest activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1). C5N2 was further applied to hypoxic PDT/CDT with outstanding performance in apparent cancer cell death and synchronous bioimaging. The study sheds light on the photosynthesis of H2O2 by carbon nitrides for health applications.

         <title>Super Light&#8208;Sensitive Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Improved Photodynamic Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super light&#8208;sensitive photosensitizer nanoparticles are fabricated by the self&#8208;assembly of Rose Bengal and hemoglobin conjugates. The nanoparticles can increase the production of singlet oxygen upon irradiation with an exceptional ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). They can be easily internalized by cancers in deep tissues and exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective method for superficial cancer treatment. However, the limited light intensity in tissues, tumor hypoxia, and the low accumulation efficiency of photosensitizers (PSs) in tumors are still major challenges. Herein, we introduce super light&#8208;sensitive PS nanoparticles (designated HR NPs) that can increase singlet oxygen (1O2) production and improve PS accumulation in tumors. HR NPs have the ability to produce a large amount of 1O2 under ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) irradiation. More significantly, HR NPs have a long circulating time in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and can accumulate in tumors with high efficiency. When irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength, the nanoparticles exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy. This work will make it possible to cure solid tumors by PDT by enhancing the therapeutic effects.

         <title>The Control of the Coordination Chemistry for the Genesis of Heterogeneous Catalytically Active Sites in Oxidation Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of coordination metal complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of fine chemicals is reviewed. Specific attention is paid to describing the phenomena leading to the genesis of the active sites, the clear characterization of the surface species, and their catalytic performance.







Abstract
This Review provides a summary of the use and the role of coordination complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation reactions of interest for fine chemical synthesis. Specific attention is paid to the comprehension of phenomena explaining the formation of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts. Different families of coordination precursors are considered. For each example, a brief critical description of the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance is reported. Special attention is paid to the chemical environment of the first coordination sphere of the active metal centre. The catalysts obtained by heterogenization, grafting, or anchoring of homogeneous catalysts can therefore exhibit enhanced catalytic performance by merging advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The deposition of coordination complexes over a preformed support is indeed a conceptually versatile strategy to design novel catalysts with tuned and controlled properties.

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Self&#8208;folding of Helical Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives in the Solid State Leading to Amplified Circular Dichroism and Circularly Polarized Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives self&#8208;fold in the solid state into a non&#8208;uniform structure with sharp turns connecting stretched segments where the turns exhibit remarkable optical anisotropy in the ground state and in excited states.







Abstract
An unprecedented non&#8208;uniform self&#8208;folding of artificial polymer chains composed of turn moieties and stretched segments is presented through the design of a set of optically active poly(fluorene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) (poly(fluorenevinylene)) derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group attached at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene backbone at various ratios. The folded structure is formed and stabilized through inter&#8208;chain interactions in the solid state, leading to remarkably enhanced chiroptical properties (chirality amplification) in terms of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized light (CPL) emission. This phenomenon is rationalized by experimental and theoretical CD and CPL spectral analyses. The polymer arrangements in the solid state were further assessed through transmission electron microscopic observations combined with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations in the solid state revealing the thin film organizations.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Edge Functionalized Top&#8208;Down Chiral Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral and fluorescent supramolecular assemblies of graphene quantum dots were built by means of amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The structural features of the resultant materials were studied by a range of analytical and spectroscopic techniques, namely FTIR, XPS, absorption and emission spectroscopy and TGA.







Abstract
Dedicated to Prof. Miguel A. Alario on the occasion of his 80th birthday
The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interactions of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.

A cavity compressing strategy is proposed to modulate the macrocyclic host&#8211;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions. The solid&#8208;state CT affinities of perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene toward various electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form.







Abstract
Modulating intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) interactions between specific donor and acceptor species in host&#8211;guest systems is a big challenge and full of research value in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, a strategy to modulate the supramolecular ICT interactions in the solid state is developed by compressing the binding cavity of a macrocyclic host named perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene (p&#8208;EtLP6). The solid&#8208;state ICT affinities of p&#8208;EtLP6 toward multi&#8208;types of electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form (m&#8208;EtLP6). X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses incorporating theoretical calculation demonstrate that the improved ICT affinities are mainly attributed to the superior host&#8211;guest size fit arising from the compressed binding cavity in m&#8208;EtLP6 as compared with p&#8208;EtLP6.

         <title>Morphology and Light&#8208;Dependent Spatial Distribution of Spin Defects in Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radicals in carbon nitride are invoked as photocatalytically competent species. However, their structure and localisation is ill&#8208;defined. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of speciation, electronic structure, long&#8208;range distributions and photo&#8208;response of such radicals, as a function of carbon nitride morphology. This work paves the way to the engineering of the defective structure of carbon nitride and related 2D materials.







Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN) is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that combines good structural properties and a broad scope. The photocatalytic efficiency of CN is associated with the presence of defective and radical species. An accurate description of defective states&#8212;both at a local and extended level&#8212;is key to develop a thorough mechanistic understanding of the photophysics of CN. In turn, this will maximise the generation and usage of photogenerated charge carriers and minimise wasteful charge recombination. Here the influence of morphology and light&#8208;excitation on the number and chemical nature of radical defects is assessed. By exploiting the magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole coupling, the spatial distribution of native radicals in CN is derived with high precision. From the analysis an average distance in the range 1.99&#8211;2.34&#8197;nm is determined, which corresponds to pairs of radicals located approximately four tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units apart.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Tubular Conjugated Polymer 2D Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with tubular channels were prepared by self&#8208;assembly followed by UV irraiation of amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes in aqueous solution. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling and colorimetric DNA sensing was demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets.







Abstract
Creation of new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures has attracted significant attention in the field of self&#8208;assembly for structural diversity and new functionalization. Although numerous 2D polymer nanosheets have been reported, 2D nanosheets with tubular channels have been unexplored. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the fabrication of stimulus&#8208;responsive conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with hollow cavities. Amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes self&#8208;assembled in an aqueous solution in a columnar manner to afford bilayered 2D nanosheets with intrinsically tubular nanochannels. UV&#8208;induced polymerization resulted in the generation of blue&#8208;colored tubular conjugated polydiacetylene 2D nanosheets. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling with FRET phenomenon and colorimetric DNA sensing were demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets. In addition, the free NH2 containing polymerized 2D nanosheet was utilized for conductivity behavior and grafting on graphene oxide (GO).

         <title>An Anticancer Rhenium Tricarbonyl Targets Fe&#8722;S Cluster Biogenesis in Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomic approach to inorganic drug discovery improves the prioritization of candidate drug targets and revealed the scaffold protein NUBP2 involved in Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis as a relevant target for the rhenium tricarbonyl TRIP. This approach efficiently deconvolutes the polypharmacology of metal&#8208;based drug candidates and may be generally applied.







Abstract
Target identification remains a critical challenge in inorganic drug discovery to deconvolute potential polypharmacology. Herein, we describe an improved approach to prioritize candidate protein targets based on a combination of dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomics and treatment effects in living cancer cells for the rhenium tricarbonyl compound TRIP. Chemoproteomics revealed 89 distinct dose&#8208;dependent targets with concentrations of competitive saturation between 0.1 and 32&#8197;&#956;M despite the broad proteotoxic effects of TRIP. Target&#8208;response networks revealed two highly probable targets of which the Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis factor NUBP2 was competitively saturated by free TRIP at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, TRIP treatment led to a down&#8208;regulation of Fe&#8722;S cluster containing proteins and upregulated ferritin. Fe&#8722;S cluster depletion was further verified by assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Consequently, TRIP emerges as a first&#8208;in&#8208;class modulator of the scaffold protein NUBP2, which disturbs Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis at sub&#8208;cytotoxic concentrations in ovarian cancer cells.

         <title>Unusual Quartet&#8208;Doublet Phosphorescence from the Phosphaethynyl Radical, CP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CP is generated by photolysis of phosphaethyne (HCP) isolated in solid argon. Phosphorescence of the radical, observed after the B2&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ photoexcitation, is assisted by an intersystem crossing from B2&#931;+ to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Intense, well&#8208;resolved vibronic progressions were traced for a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#1055;i emission systems. Phosphorescence lifetime is on the order of 0.1&#8197;s.







Abstract
We report the first detection of phosphorescence from the phosphaethynyl radical. This rare instance of quartet&#8208;doublet emission, studied here in solid argon, is presumably promoted by efficient intersystem crossing from the originally photoexcited doublet (B2&#931;+) to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Vibronic progressions were traced for the a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#1055;i systems from their origins up to (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=5) and (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=2) bands, respectively. The measured phosphorescence lifetime is 108 &#177; 3&#8197;ms.

         <title>Maximized Green Photoluminescence in Tb&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Pressure&#8208;Treated Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks are of interest in the development of photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their&#160;structural tunability and intrinsic features of lanthanide elements. However, there exists some limitations arising from poor matching&#160;with metal ions, thereby exhibiting a weak ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer (LMET) process. Here we demonstrate a pressure&#8208;treated strategy for achieving high PL performance in green&#8208;emitting Tb(BTC)(H2O)6. The photoluminescence quantum yield of pressure&#8208;treated sample increased from 50.6% to 90.4%. We found that the&#160;enhanced hydrogen bonds locked the conjugated configuration formed by two planes of carboxyl group and benzene ring, enabling the promoted intersystem crossing to effectively drive LMET. Moreover, the optimized singlet and triplet states also validated the facilitated LMET process. This work opens the opportunity of structure&#160;optimization to improve PL performance in MOFs by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Transient Chirality Transfer and Atroposelective C&#8208;H Functionalization to Access Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3 + 2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Donicity of Liquid electrolytes for Lithium Carbon Fluoride Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy powers have greatly incentivized the development of lithium carbon fluoride (Li || CF  x  ) cells. Five kinds of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes with various kinds of lithium salts (LiX, X = PF  6  &#8722;  , TFSI  &#8722;  , BF  4  &#8722;  , ClO  4  &#8722;  , and CF  3  SO  3  &#8722;  ) were comparatively studied. Intriguingly, the LiBF  4  &#8208;based electrolyte show relatively moderate ionic conductivities; yet, the corresponding Li || CF  x  cells deliver the highest discharge capacities among them. A combination of morphological and compositional analyses of the discharge CF  x  cathode suggest that the moderate donicity of BF  4  &#8722;  anion is accountable for favoring the breakdown of C&#8722;F bonds, and subsequently forming crystalline lithium fluoride as the main discharge products. This work brings not only fresh understanding on the role of salt anions for Li || CF  x  cells, but also inspire the electrolyte design for other conversion&#8208;type (sulfur and/or organosulfur) cathode materials desired for high&#8208;energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous N&#8208;rich Carbon with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms as a Multifunctional Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physicochemical confinement and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are crucial to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, a NH4Cl&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is developed to fabricate highly mesoporous N&#8208;rich carbon (designed as NC(p)) featuring thin outer shells and porous inner networks, on which single&#8208;Ni atoms are anchored to form an excellent sulfur host (designed as Ni&#8208;NC(p)) for Li&#8208;S batteries. During pyrolysis, the pyrolytic HCl from confined NH4Cl within ZIF&#8208;8 will in situ etch ZIF&#8208;8 to produce rich mesopores in the carbonized product NC(p). The mesoporous Ni&#8208;NC(p) enables favorable electron/ion transfer, high sulfur loading, and effective confinement of LiPSs, while the catalytic effect of single&#8208;Ni species enhances the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the Ni&#8208;NC(p) host delivers obviously improved Li&#8208;S battery performance with high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Multicomponent Synthesis of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Consecutive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  &#8208;Acyl glycosides are versatile intermediates to natural products and medicinally relevant entities. Conventional cross&#8208;coupling strategies to secure these molecules often relied on two&#8208;component manifolds in which a glycosyl precursor is coupled with an acyl donor (pre&#8208;synthesized or generated  in situ  ) under transition metal or dual catalysis to forge a C&#8208;C bond. Here, we disclose a three&#8208;component Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive regime that facilitates the chemoselective union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and commercially available isobutyl chloroformate as a CO surrogate. The method tolerates multiple functionalities and the resulting products are obtained in high diastereoselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide a mechanistic rationale for the unexpectedly high chemoselectivity of sequential cross&#8208;electrophile couplings. This approach enables the expeditious assembly of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize  C  &#8208;acyl glycosides, as well as late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of oligopeptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Support Modulates the Microenvironment of Pd Nanoparticles for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While exposed support facet of supported catalysts plays a crucial role in catalysis, this is usually ignored and related studies remain rare. Herein, a series of sandwich&#8208;structured ZIF&#8208;8x@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 composites (X represents the morphology of ZIF&#8208;8 core, including ZIF&#8208;8C  exposing (100) facet, ZIF&#8208;8RD  exposing (110) facet, and ZIF&#8208;8TRD  exposing mixed (100) and (110) facets), featuring small Pd nanoparticles deposited on the specific crystal facets of ZIF&#8208;8 core, are rationally fabricated for hydrogenation of  p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. Remarkably, the Pd electronic state is tailored by ZIF&#8208;8 core, where more electron&#8208;deficient Pd is found in ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 than that in ZIF&#8208;8RD@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8, leading to discriminative adsorption of &#8211;NO2  and &#8211;Cl group of  p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. As a result, the ZIF&#8208;8C@Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit excellent activity (97.6%) and selectivity (98.1%) to  p&#8208;chloroaniline, far superior to other counterparts. This work highlights crystal facet engineering of supports for modulating microenvironment and electronic state of supported metal nanoparticles, offering a promising avenue to enhanced catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, thiol&#8208;Michael exchange, Diels&#8208;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials. Finally, this review suggests how to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymer materials though both kinetic effects and modulating bond thermodynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Metal Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework MFM&#8208;300(Sc): Lewis Acid Catalysis Driven by Metal&#8208;Hemilabile Linker Bond Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncommon reversible guest&#8208;induced metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond dynamics in the MOF MFM&#8208;300(Sc) was unraveled to switch on/switch off catalytic open metal sites. The catalytic activity of this MOF with non&#8208;permanent open metal sites was demonstrated using a model Strecker hydrocyanation reaction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Conclusively, the catalytic activity was evidenced to be fully reversible, preserving the conversion performance and structure integrity of MFM&#8208;300(Sc) over multiple cycles. These experimental findings were corroborated by quantum&#8208;calculations that revealed a reaction mechanism driven by the Sc&#8208;open metal sites. This discovery paves the way towards the design of new effective and easily regenerable heterogeneous MOF catalysts integrating switchable metal sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles using Visible&#8208;Light Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that both undergo isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, allowing for control of the number of monomers involved in cyclo&#8208;oligomerization, which were investigated using 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/VIS spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic optimization of the elementary steps of water dissociation and hydrogen desorption for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is challenge but it is vital. Herein, the Ru cluster anchored on a trace P&#8208;doped defective TiO  2  substrate (Ru/P&#8208;TiO  2  ) was synthesized as an excellent electrocatalyst for the HER; it exhibited a commercial Pt/C&#8208;like geometric activity and an excellent mass activity of 9984.3 mA mg  Ru  &#8208;1  at &#8208;0.05 V vs. RHE, which is 34.3 and 18.7 times higher than that of Pt/C and Ru/TiO  2  , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies indicated that using a rutileTiO  2  &#8208;crystal&#8208;phase substrate enhanced the HER activity more than the anatase phase. Rich surface oxygen vacancies on rutileTiO  2  facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of water, while the partial substitution of Ti  4+  with P  5+  enhanced H  2  generation by facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Catalysis in Stereodivergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an important strategy for developing new reactions in stereodivergent synthesis. This strategy is also a simple and powerful approach for synthesizing all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters from the same set of starting materials. This Minireview summarizes recent progress and briefly gives perspectives for the future advancement of this field.







Abstract
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis, whereby all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters can be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this Minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Analysis of Anionic Coordination Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative&#8208;ion mode ESI mass spectrometry permits the direct observation of anionic polymers resulting from the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with CoCl2 and organolithium reagents.







Abstract
Anionic coordination polymerizations proceed via highly reactive intermediates, whose in situ analysis has remained difficult. Here, we show that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is a promising method to obtain detailed information on the polymerization process. Focusing on polymerization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes initiated by CoCl2/RLi (R=Me, nBu, tBu, Ph), we directly observe the growing polymer chains and characterize the active anionic cobalt centers by gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments. On the basis of these results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the ESI mass spectra permit the determination of molecular weight distributions, which are in good agreement with those derived from NMR&#8208;spectroscopic as well as MALDI mass&#8208;spectrometric measurements, and afford a wealth of kinetic data.

&lt;p&gt;Negative-ion mode ESI mass spectrometry permits the direct observation of anionic polymers resulting from the reaction of 1,3-dienes with CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and organolithium reagents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic coordination polymerizations proceed via highly reactive intermediates, whose in situ analysis has remained difficult. Here, we show that electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry is a promising method to obtain detailed information on the polymerization process. Focusing on polymerization reactions of 1,3-dienes initiated by CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/RLi (R=Me, nBu, tBu, Ph), we directly observe the growing polymer chains and characterize the active anionic cobalt centers by gas-phase fragmentation experiments. On the basis of these results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the ESI mass spectra permit the determination of molecular weight distributions, which are in good agreement with those derived from NMR-spectroscopic as well as MALDI mass-spectrometric measurements, and afford a wealth of kinetic data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustaining Fluorination of Active Methylene Compounds and High&#8208;Yielding Fluorination of Highly Basic Aryl and Alkenyl Lithium Species with a Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Fluorosulfonamide Reagent</title>

         <dc:description>
By developing a sterically hindered fluorinating agent, N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved an unprecedented high&#8208;yield fluorination of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species.







Abstract
Fluorination of carbanions is pivotal for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds, but the current N&#8208;F fluorinating agents have significant drawbacks due to many reactive locations that surround the reactive N&#8722;F site. By developing a sterically hindered N&#8208;fluorosulfonamide reagent, namely N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved the high&#8208;yielding fluorination of the hitherto difficult highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species. In the former, the mild and high yield fluorination of active methylene compounds exhibited wide functional group tolerance and its novel catalytic fluorination&#8208;deprotonation cycle mechanism was demonstrated by deuterium&#8208;tracing experiments. In the latter, NFBB reacted with a variety of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species to provide the desired fluoro (hetero)arenes and alkenes in unprecedented high or quantitative yields.

         <title>Colloidal Jamming by Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembled Polymers: A Robust Route for Ultrahigh Efficient Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic polymers block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids giving an efficient protein and peptide encapsulation. Profiting from the high mass fraction of therapeutics (58.3&#8197;wt%), the mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times lower than that with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones. One injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites held the blood glucose level within normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
The control of cargo phase&#8208;transfer is of interest for many applications in science and technology. Herein, we report a simple, versatile and robust method to block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids by interfacial self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic polymer molecules. After simply increasing the concentration of amphiphilic polymers, the orientation of interfacial polymer molecules changed from flat to upright, forming a thick three&#8208;dimensional polymer layer at the oil&#8208;water interface. Even under fierce external force, this thick interfacial layer robustly prevented the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids, resulting in an ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency (up to 97.1&#8201;%) for proteins and peptides. One single injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites (58.3&#8197;wt%) kept the blood glucose level within the normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days in type&#8197;1 diabetic rats. The mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times smaller than that of microcomposites prepared with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Perovskite Vertical Growth for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene nanosheets introduced to SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells maximize the interface matching between SnO2 and perovskite and induce vertically aligned crystal growth. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved by 15&#8201;%, reaching 23.07&#8201;%, and the short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, an unencapsulated device maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 500&#8197;h of storage in ambient air.







Abstract
Defects at the interfaces of perovskite (PVK) thin films are the main factors responsible for instability and low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVK solar cells (PSCs). Here, a SnO2&#8208;MXene composite electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PSCs to improve interfacial contact and passivate defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The introduced MXene regulates SnO2 dispersion and induces a vertical growth of PVK. The lattice matching of MXene and perovskite suppresses the concentration of interfacial stress, thereby obtaining a perovskite film with low defects. Compared with SnO2&#8208;based device, the PCE of SnO2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based device is improved by 15&#8201;% and its short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after 500&#8197;h of storage at 30&#8211;40&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.

         <dc:description>We report a general synthetic route toward freeform helical ladder polymers with&#160; varying &#160;spring constants, built with chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). Under tension and compression, these shape&#8208;persistent structures do not unfold, but rather stretch and compress akin classical Hookean springs. Our synthesis is adaptable to helices with different pitch and diameter, which allowed us to investigate how molecular flexibility in solution depends on the exact geometry of the ladder polymers. Specifically, we showed with molecular dynamic simulations and by measuring the longitudinal&#160;  1  H NMR relaxation times (  T  1  ) for our polymers at different Larmor frequencies, that increasing the helix diameter leads to increased flexibility. Our results present initial design rules for tuning the mechanical properties of intrinsically helical ladder polymers in solution, which will help inspire a new class of robust, spring&#8208;like molecular materials with&#160; varying mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Approach to Chemically Durable Nickel and Cobalt Lanthanum&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Based Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;nitride complexes have recently been proposed as an efficient noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst for ammonia synthesis utilizing a dual active site concept. However, their high sensitivity to air and moisture restricted potential applications. Here, we report that their chemical sensitivity can be improved by introducing Al into LaN lattice that form La&#8208;Al metallic bond (La&#8208;Al&#8208;N). The catalytic activity and mechanism of the resulting  TM  /La&#8208;Al&#8208;N (  TM  = Ni, Co) are comparable to the previously reported  TM  /LaN catalyst. Notably, the catalytic activity did not degrade after exposure to air and moisture. Kinetic analysis and isotopic experiment showed that La&#8208;Al&#8208;N is responsible for N  2  absorption and activation despite substantial Al being introduced into its lattice because the local coordination of lattice N remained largely unchanged. These findings show the effectiveness of metallic bond formation, allowing rare&#8208;earth&#8208;nitride to co&#8208;host chemical stability and catalytic functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network without Creep: Mission Impossible?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent polymer networks provide an interesting solution to the challenging recyclability of thermosets and elastomers. One of the remaining design constraints, however, is balancing thermal reprocessability in the form of material flow with dimensional stability during use. As a result, many chemistries are being investigated in order to improve bond reactivity control and material robustness. This perspective highlights a number of promising concepts, with a particular emphasis on disconnecting chemical reactivity in low and high temperature regimes to obtain creep resistant, yet highly dynamic polymer networks. In addition, we will highlight the impact of sharp reactivity changes when applying extrapolation&#8208;based approaches during rheological analysis. As a result, we are confident that abandoning the myth of 'permanent' reactivity will aid in the development of sustainable polymeric materials that can truly combine the benefits of thermoplastic and thermoset behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Gold&#8208;Gold Wettability for Programmable Plasmonic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the deposition and diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on the surface of a solid material is vital for engineering the shape and function of nanocrystals. Here, we report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms to synthesize highly tunable plasmonic nanostructures. We find that the oligo&#8208;A attachment transforms the nanocrystal growth mode from the classical Frank&#8208;van der Merwe to the Volmer&#8208;Weber island growth. Finely tuning the oligo&#8208;A density can continuously change the gold&#8208;gold contact angle (&#952;) from 35.1&#176; to 125.3&#176;. We further demonstrate the versatility of this strategy for engineering nanoparticles with different curvature and dimensions. With this unconventional growth mode, we synthesize a sub&#8208;nanometer plasmonic cavity with a geometrical singularity when &#952;&gt;90&#176;. Superfocusing of light in this nanocavity produces a near&#8208;infrared intraparticle plasmonic coupling, which paves the way to surface engineering of single&#8208;particle plasmonic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically require expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such transformation is relevant for industry as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine chemicals due to the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different set of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes avoiding the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last years paving the way for generating more sustainable protocols including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes utilizing more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>H+&#8208;H&#8208; Pairs in Partial Oxidized MAX Phases for Bifunctional Catalytic Conversion of Furfurals into Linear Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the less favorable C=O hydrogenation and weak concerted acid catalysis cause unsatisfactory catalytic performance in the upgrading biomass&#8208;derived furfurals (i.e., furfural, 5&#8208;methyl furfural, and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural) to ketones (i.e., cyclopentanone, 2,5&#8208;hexanedione, and 1&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;hexanedione). Herein, a series of  partial oxidized MAX phase  (i.e., Ti  3  AlC  2  , Ti  2  AlC, Ti  3  SiC  2  ) supported Pd catalysts were fabricated, which showed high catalytic activity, particularly the Pd/Ti  3  AlC  2  displayed high efficiency to the target ketones. Detailed studies of catalytic mechanism confirm that in situ hydrogen spillover generates Frustrated Lewis H  +  &#8208;H  &#8722;  pairs, which not only act as the hydrogenation sites for the selective C=O hydrogenation but also provide acid sites for the ring opening. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites largely promote the bifunctional catalytic reactions, substantially reducing the reported minimum reaction temperature of various furfurals by at least 30&#8211;60 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical assembly of a micro&#8208; and macroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic molecular framework with tailored single&#8208;crystal size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>:  Porous organic molecular materials represent an emergent field of research in Chemistry and Materials Science due to their unique combination of properties. To enhance their performance and expand the number of applications, the incorporation of hierarchical porosity is required, as exclusive microporosity entails several limitations. However, the integration of macropores in porous organic molecular materials is still an outstanding challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (  MM&#8208;TPY  )  with hierarchical skeletal morphology, containing stable micro&#8208; and macroporosity. The crystal size, from micro to centimetre scale, can be controlled in a single step without using additives or templates.  The mechanism of assembly during the crystal formation is compatible with a skeletal crystal growt  h. As proof of concept, we employed the hierarchical porosity as a platform for the dual, sequential and selective co&#8208;recognition of molecular species and microparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State Creutz&#8208;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excited&#8208;state version of the Creutz&#8208;Taube ion was prepared via visible light excitation of [(NH  3  )  5  Ru  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;pz)Ru  II  (NH  3  )  5  ]  4+  . The resulting excited state is a mixed valence {Ru  III&#8211;&#948;  (  &#956;  &#8208;pz  &#8226;&#8211;  )Ru  II+&#948;  } transient species, which was characterized using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with vis&#8208;NIR detection. Very intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfers were observed at 7500 cm  &#8208;1  , revealing an excited&#8208;state electronic coupling element H  DA  = 3750 cm  &#8208;1  . DFT calculations confirm a strongly delocalized excited state. A notable consequence of strong electron delocalization is the nanosecond excited state lifetime, which was exploited in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept intermolecular electron transfer. The excited&#8208;state Creutz&#8208;Taube ion is established as a reference, and demonstrates that electron delocalization in the excited state can be leveraged for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic schemes based on electron transfer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli responsive silylene: Electromerism induced reversible switching between mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromerism is a very well&#8208;known phenomenon in transition metal chemistry. In main group chemistry, this concept has only started getting attention recently. We report stimuli responsive low&#8208;valent silicon compounds exhibiting electromerism. A mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8208;silylene  1  , [  L  Si&#8208;Si(NDipp)  L  ] (  L  = PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ), was synthesized in a single step from amidinate&#8208;chlorosilylene. Compound  1  has two interconnected Si atoms in formally +I and +III oxidation states. Upon treatment with Lewis acidic Cu(I)X (X = Mesityl, Cl, Br, I), electron redistribution occurs resulting in the formation of [{  L  Si(NDipp)Si(  L  )}&#8208;CuX], in which both silicon atoms are in the +II formal oxidation state. Removal of the copper center from [{  L  Si(NDipp)Si(  L  )}&#8208;CuX] by using a Lewis basic carbene led to reformation of the precursor [  L  Si&#8208;Si(NDipp)  L  ]. Thus, the process is fully reversible. This showcases the first example of Lewis acid/base induced reversible electromerism in silicon chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a  de novo  designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH 7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH 3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between the redox&#8208;active  N&#8208;  trifluoroethoxyphthalimide and iodoarenes is documented. The protocol reproduces a formal arylation of trifluoroacetaldehyde under mild conditions in high yields (up to 88%) and with large functional group tolerance (30 examples). A combined computational and experimental investigation revealed a pivotal solvent assisted 1,2&#8208;HAT process to generate a nucleophilic a&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;a&#8208;trifluoromethyl C&#8208;centered radical for the Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  3  bond forming process.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3 Labeling Constitutes a Sensitive 19F NMR Probe for&#160;Characterization of Interactions in the Minor Groove of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated nucleotides are invaluable for  19F NMR studies of nucleic acid structure and function. Here, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  &#8208;thymidine (T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  ) and incorporated it into DNA by means of solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis. NMR studies showed that the 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  group exhibited a flexible orientation in the minor groove of DNA duplexes and was well accommodated by various higher order DNA structures. The three magnetically equivalent fluorine atoms in 4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  &#8208;DNA constitute an isolated spin system, offering high  19F NMR sensitivity and excellent resolution of the positioning of T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  within various secondary and tertiary DNA structures. The high structural adaptability and high sensitivity of T  4&#8242;&#8208;SCF3  make it a valuable  19F NMR probe for quantitatively distinguishing diverse DNA structures with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution and for monitoring the dynamics of interactions in the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light mediated carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;couplings follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that were reported to undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretic and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible&#8208;light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;couplings. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming Heavier Group 14 Imine Analogues: Accessing Tin Nitrogen [Sn=N] Double Bonds and their Cycloaddition/Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic study to access stable stannaimines is reported, by combining different heteroleptic stannylenes with a range of organic azides. The reactions of terphenyl&#8208;/hypersilyl&#8208;substituted stannylenes yield the putative tin nitrogen double bond, but is directly followed by 1,2&#8208;silyl migration to give Sn(II) systems featuring bulky silylamido ligands. By contrast, the transition from a two V donor ligand set to a mixed V&#8208;donor / S&#8208;donor scaffold allows access to three new stannaimines which can be handled at room temperature. The reactivity profile of these Sn=N bonded species is crucially dependent on the substituent at the nitrogen atom. As such, the Sn=NMes system is capable of activating a broad range of substrates under ambient conditions via 1,2&#8208;addition reactions, [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Most interestingly, very rare examples of main group multiple bond metathesis reactions are also found to be viable.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks by Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have shown great promise in electronics and optoelectronics. However, only a few reactions for V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs have been developed hitherto. Besides the kinetically low reversibility of C=C bond formation, another underlying issue facing the synthesis of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs is the attainment of high (  E  )&#8208;alkene selectivity to ensure the appropriate symmetry of 2D frameworks. Here, we tailor the  E/Z  selectivity of the Wittig reaction by employing a proper catalyst (i.e., Cs  2  CO  3  ) to obtain more stable intermediates and evaluate the temperature across the reaction barrier. Subsequently, the Wittig reaction is innovatively utilized for the synthesis of four crystalline V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs by combining aldehydes and ylides. Importantly, the efficient conjugation and decent crystallinity of the resultant V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs are demonstrated by their high charge carrier mobilities over 10 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , as revealed by non&#8208;contact terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>It is significant and challenging to use CO  2  to produce polymeric materials, especially with olefins. Here, a novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is designed and performed for the copolymerization of a CO  2  &#8208;and&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;derived valerolactone, 3&#8208;ethylidene&#8208;6&#8208;vinyltetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (EVL), with &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) to prepare polyesters. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting polyester P(CL&#8208;co&#8208;EVL) with tunable topology and composition. The non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break &gt; 600% is able to be used as an elastomer. The communication proposes a method to provide polyester elastomer from CO  2  and olefins for the first time, and expands the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.</dc:description>

This complex is a rare heavy analogue of the elusive pyramidane [C(&#951;4&#8208;C4H4)]. [1]2+ undergoes two reversible one&#8208;electron reductions which yield the radical cation [2] &#8226;+  and the neutral Ge(II) species 3. Both [2] &#8226;+  and 3 rearrange in solution forming the 2D aromatic and planar imidazolium&#8208;substituted digermolide [4]2+ and germole&#8208;diide 5, respectively. Both planar species can be oxidized back to [1]2+ using AgSbF6. These redox&#8208;isomerizations correspond to the fundamental transformation of a 3D aromatic cluster into a 2D aromatic ring compound upon reduction and vice versa. The mechanism of these reactions was elucidated using DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry experiments.</dc:description>

Abstract
Post&#8208;modification of robust guanine&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;linked 2,2&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;containing HOF&#8208;25 with Ni(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O followed by exfoliation using sonication method affords hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanosheets (NSs) of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni in the yield of 56&#8201;%. TEM and AFM technologies disclose the ultrathin nature of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni NSs with thickness of 4.4&#8197;nm. STM observation determines the presence of sql segments assembled from HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni building blocks at the heptanoic acid/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite interface, supporting the simulated 2D supramolecular framework. ICP&#8208;MS, XAS, and XPS data prove the successful immobilization of atomic nickel sites on the 20&#8201;% total 2,2&#8242;&#8208;pyridine moieties in crystalline HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni. With the aid of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and triisopropanolamine, 10&#8197;wt% HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Ni NSs dispersed on graphene oxide efficiently promotes visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction, showing a 96.3&#8201;% CO selectivity with a prominent conversion rate up to 24&#8201;323&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Simultaneous Photoactivation of cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway and Pyroptosis by Platinum (II) Triphenylamine Complexes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small molecule that can activate cGAS&#8208;STING in a photocontrollable way is reported. Upon irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 can damage mitochondrial DNA, the nuclear envelope and nuclear DNA sequentially, which effectively releases DNA into cytoplasm to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway is a potent anticancer immunotherapeutic strategy, and the induction of pyroptosis is a feasible way to stimulate the anticancer immune responses. Herein, two PtII complexes (Pt1 and Pt2) were designed as photoactivators of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In response to light irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 could damage mitochondrial/nuclear DNA and the nuclear envelope to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and concurrently induce pyroptosis in cancer cells, which evoked an intense anticancer immune response in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Overall, we present the first photoactivator of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, which may provide an innovative design strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>In Situ Imaging of Ion Motion in a Single Nanoparticle: Structural Transformations in Selenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle was achieved by dark&#8208;field microscopy and disclosed the transformation of amorphous SeNPs into polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2.







Abstract
Intraparticle ion motions are critical to the structure and properties of nanomaterials, but rarely disclosed. Herein, in situ visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle is presented by dark&#8208;field microscopy imaging, which shows HgCl2&#8208;induced structural transformation of amorphous selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with the main composition of Se8. Owing to the high binding affinity with selenium and coulomb interactions, Hg2+ ions can permeate into the interior of SeNPs, making the amorphous Se8 turn to polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2. As a proof of concept, SeNPs then serve as a highly effective scavenger for selective removal of Hg2+ ions from solution. This new finding offers visual proof for the photophysical process involving intraparticle ion motion, demonstrating that tracking the ion motions is a novel strategy to comprehend the formation mechanism with the purpose of developing new nanostructures like nanoalloys and nano metal compounds.

         <title>Ultrasmall Copper Nanoclusters in Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature synthetic strategy is reported for incorporation of ultrasmall Cu nanoclusters into a series of robust Zr&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The resultant core&#8211;shell composites mediate CO2 photoreduction selectively and outperform similar composites even with variable Cu spatial distribution.







Abstract
Encapsulating ultrasmall Cu nanoparticles inside Zr&#8208;MOFs to form core&#8211;shell architecture is very challenging but of interest for CO2 reduction. We report for the first time the incorporation of ultrasmall Cu NCs into a series of benchmark Zr&#8208;MOFs, without Cu NCs aggregation, via a scalable room temperature fabrication approach. The Cu NCs@MOFs core&#8211;shell composites show much enhanced reactivity in comparison to the Cu NCs confined in the pore of MOFs, regardless of their very similar intrinsic properties at the atomic level. Moreover, introducing polar groups on the MOF structure can further improve both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the CuI sites located at the interface between Cu NCs and support serve as the active sites and efficiently catalyze CO2 photoreduction. This synergetic effect may pave the way for the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient catalysts for CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;value chemical feedstock.

         <title>Regioselective Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8722;H Borylation: A Subject of Practical and Ongoing Interest in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in strategies for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation are summarized in this Review. Strategies developed to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic borylation, such as approaches controlled by electronic effects, auxiliaries, and steric factors, are also discussed. EDG=electron donating group, DG=directing group, TM=transition metal.







Abstract
Considerable advances have been made in the area of C&#8722;H functionalization in the last few decades. A number of approaches including both directed and nondirected strategies have been developed thus far. Among the various C&#8722;H functionalizations, C&#8722;H borylation is of special interest due to the wide applications of organoboron compounds. In this regard, various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regioselective strategies have been developed. However, the major concern regarding metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation procedures is the requirement of a precious metal as well as the contamination by metal precursors in the desired products, which limit the application of this process in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, recent trends have involved the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems. We summarize recent developments in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation. We believe that this Review will help to increase interest in this field and stimulate further progress.

         <title>Quantifying the Solution Structure of Metal Nanoclusters Using Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can directly quantify the overall structure parameters of nanoclusters in solution without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization. A series of silver and gold nanoclusters were studied with SANS demonstrating good agreement with crystallographic data in both the shape, size and the molecular weight information.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters are a unique class of synthetic material, as their crystal structures can be resolved using X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their chemical formula can be precisely determinated from mass spectroscopy. However, a complete structure characterization by these two techniques is often a challenging task. Here, we utilize small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) to directly quantify the key structure parameters of a series of silver and gold nanoclusters in solution. The results not only correlate well to their crystallographic structures, but also allow the quantification of the counterions layer surrounding charged nanoclusters in solution. Furthermore, when combining with X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to estimate the molecular weight of both the metal core and the ligand shell of nanoclusters. This work offers an alternative characterization tool for nanoclusters without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization.

         <title>Understanding the Nature and Strength of Noncovalent Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new series of fullerene&#8208;based molecular torsion balances and examined their folding equilibrium to understand the nature and strength of noncovalent face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8722;fullerene interactions. The contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions were experimentally quantified by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.







Abstract
Face&#8208;to&#8208;face noncovalent arene&#8722;fullerene interactions are important in several research fields such as synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and medicinal chemistry; however, their nature and strength are still poorly understood. In this study, we prepare a fullerene&#8208;based torsion balance containing thioanisole, phenol, naphthalene, azulene, and pyrene moieties as a unimolecular model system. Moreover, we compare the folding free energies between the folded and the unfolded conformers of a series of the molecular torsion balances to quantify noncovalent interactions between arenes and the fullerene surface. This work demonstrates that the contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions can be experimentally measured by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.

         <title>Modular Construction of a Tessellated Octahedron, its Hierarchical Spherical Aggregate Behavior, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a tessellated triangle T1 and the construction of a tessellated octahedron O1 containing metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels are demonstrated. O1 has a diameter on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and a molecular weight greater than 84&#8197;kDa. After hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has led to the formation of various aesthetical polyhedrons and compounds with advanced functions. Whereas two&#8208;dimensional supramolecules with complex and giant skeletons are plentiful, the constructions of polyhedrons are limited by using basic polygons as the panels. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tessellated triangle and tessellated octahedron with metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels and formed via template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These architectures have diameters on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and molecular weights greater than 84&#8197;kDa. Interestingly, fiber and spherical&#8208;like nanostructures could be formed from the tessellated triangles and octahedrons, respectively, through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. In addition, after hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.

         <title>Anticancer Approach Inspired by the Hepatotoxic Mechanism of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids with Glycosylated Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. We developed a therapeutic approach, in which a precursor is transformed into a synthetic DHP via 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization catalyzed by a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM). In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a glycosylated ArM suppressed cell growth of targeted cancer cells.







Abstract
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA&#8208;induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization using a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450. In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a cancer&#8208;targeting glycosylated gold&#8208;based ArM substantially suppressed cell growth of the targeted cancer cells without causing cytotoxicity to untargeted cells, highlighting the potential of the strategy to be used therapeutically in vivo.

         <title>Catalytic Applications of Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Oxide Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise of being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials with a small environmental footprint. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years, more complex oxides have emerged. This Review discusses different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials having a small environmental footprint and excellent performance, albeit inferior to that of noble metal counterparts. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years more complex oxides and added functionality have emerged with enhanced performance. We will discuss different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis. We pay special attention to discriminate between the role of free versus that of bound charges within the catalyst, which is crucial to disentangle the different contributions to the catalytic reaction for the benefit of the overall enhanced catalytic performance in e.g. wastewater treatment and ultimately water&#8208;splitting.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of Sulfonamides with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides/Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamidation of (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with excellent reaction scope by using oxalamides or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides as the ligands. For bromides, only 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% CuI and oxalamides were required. For chlorides, increasing catalytic loadings to 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu2O and ligands was needed. Direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs were achieved under these conditions.







Abstract
Direct N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides is a very attractive approach for preparing pharmaceutically important N&#8208;(hetero)aryl sulfonamides because it avoids the potential genotoxic problem resulting from the previous condensation method. Most known catalytic methods suffer from limited reaction scope and inconveniency on metal catalyst and ligand availability. Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper salts and oxalamides at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the catalysis of Cu2O and a 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>

A reversible and fast vapor&#8208;triggered mechanical response of an actuating composite film based on crystalline organic cages.







Abstract
The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (Oba&#8208;cage) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Morphological Anisotropy in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Micro/Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework micro/nanoparticles (MOF MNPs) are reviewed with a focus on their morphological anisotropy, which plays a unique role in producing innovative structures and regulating properties with enhanced performance.







Abstract
Anisotropy plays a unique role in the structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites, especially at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. However, there is a lack of a understanding of MOF micro/nanoparticles (MNPs) from the perspective of morphological anisotropy. In this Minireview, recent advances in anisotropic MOF MNPs are summarized, with a focus on how morphological anisotropy leads to innovative structures and modulates properties. First, anisotropic pristine MOF MNPs with diverse morphologies are introduced and classified by their morphology&#8208;dependent and morphology&#8208;independent anisotropy. Secondly, the anisotropy&#8208;enabled site&#8208;selective higher&#8208;order construction of MOF&#8208;based materials is highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for anisotropic MOFs are discussed, aiming to provide inspiration for further developments in this interesting research field.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Recognition of Dicyanoaurate(I) by a Bambusuril Macrocycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bambusuril macrocycle is utilized for selective stripping of [Au(CN)2]&#8722; anion from activated carbon&#8212;a process relevant to industrial gold production. The efficient stripping is due to the complex of the macrocycle and [Au(CN)2]&#8722; formed at micromolar concentration in aqueous media.







Abstract
Dicyanoaurate(I) anion, [Au(CN)2]&#8722;, plays a central role in the current industrial production of gold, as its extraction from crude ore samples represents the most money&#8208;consuming step. Herein, we present the strongest host&#8211;guest recognition of dicyanoaurate anion using the bambusuril receptor in water, a highly competitive solvent. The micromolar stability of such a complex facilitated the up to date most efficient supramolecular stripping of dicyanoaurate from activated carbon at ambient temperature. Thermodynamic characteristics of bambusuril binding with [Au(CN)2]&#8722; differing from binding of other inorganic chaotropic anions are rationalized, as well as the bambusuril selectivity for [Au(CN)2]&#8722; over [Ag(CN)2]&#8722;.

         <title>Introducing the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand into Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluorinated Cp* analogue [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; resisted all coordination attempts for more than 40&#8197;years. Now its first transition metal complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] is reported. The exceptionally weak binding character of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is proved by DFT calculations and substitution reactions with arenes, allowing to switch between ligand and weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
The reaction of AgBF4 and [Rh(COD)Cl]2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the fluorocarbon soluble complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] by salt metathesis. This complex represents the first example for a successful coordination of the weakly basic [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand, since its first synthesis in 1980. In addition to [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] also the byproduct [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)4H)] was isolated and fully characterized. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the interaction energy of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand towards the 12&#8208;electron fragment [Rh(COD)]+ is &#8776;70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in comparison to [C5(CH3)5]&#8722; due to reduced electrostatic interactions and weaker &#960;&#8208;donor properties of the ligand. The quantitative but reversible substitution of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand by toluene, converting it into a weakly coordinating anion, experimentally proved the extraordinary weak bonding interaction.

         <title>Diterpene Biosynthesis from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogues with Changed Reactivities Expands Skeletal Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two analogues of geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bond were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases. The double bond shift causes a change of reactivity that results in the formation of many diterpenes with novel skeletons. A total number of 28 new diterpenes is reported and their mechanism of formation is discussed.







Abstract
Two analogues of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bonds, named iso&#8208;GGPP I and iso&#8208;GGPP II, were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases from bacteria, fungi and protists. The changed reactivity in the substrate analogues resulted in the formation of 28 new diterpenes, many of which exhibit novel skeletons.
