         <title>Oxidation and Reduction Pathways in the Knowles Hydroamination via a Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic reaction path exploration revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles&#8217;s light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination. Bond formation/cleavage competes with single electron transfer (SET) between the catalyst and substrate. These processes are described by adiabatic processes through transition states in an electronic state and non&#8208;radiative transitions through the seam of crossings (SX) between different electronic states. This study determined the energetically favorable SET path by introducing a practical computational model representing SET as non&#8208;adiabatic transitions via SXs between substrate's potential energy surfaces for different charge states adjusted based on the catalyst's redox potential. Calculations showed that the reduction and proton shuttle process proceeded concertedly. Also, the relative importance of SET paths (giving the product and leading back to the reactant) varies depending on the catalyst's redox potential, affecting the yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Transfer Hydroiodination of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes is reported. Depending on the choice of ligand and substrate, either (  E  )&#8208; or (  Z  )&#8208;configured alkenyl iodides are obtained in high to exclusive isomeric purity. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance, employing easily accessible or commercially available aliphatic iodides as HI surrogates through a shuttle process. The synthesized vinyl iodides were applied in several C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with full retention of the stereoselectivity. The developed method could be used to significantly shorten the total synthesis of a marine  cis  &#8208;fatty acid. Additionally, initial deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and stoichiometric reactions shed some light on the potential reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;soluble Self&#8208;assembled {Pd84}Ac Polyoxopalladate Nano&#8208;wheel as a Supramolecular Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxopalladates (POPs) are a class of self&#8208;assembling palladium&#8208;oxide clusters that span a variety of sizes, shapes and compositions. The largest of this family, {Pd84}Ac, is constructed from 14 building units of {Pd6} and lined on the inner and outer torus by 28 acetate ligands. Due to its high water solubility, large hydrophobic cavity and distinct 1H NMR fingerprint {Pd84}Ac is an ideal molecule for exploring supramolecular behaviour with small organic molecules in aqueous media. Molecular modelling studies highlighted potential binding sites between {Pd84}Ac and these species. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques, including 1H NMR, 1H Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy (DOSY) and Nuclear Overhauser Spectroscopy (NOESY), were employed to study the supramolecular chemistry of this system. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that {Pd84}Ac forms a 1:7 host&#8208;guest complex with benzyl viologen (BV2+) in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Shuttle Hetero&#8208;difunctionalization Reactions: Electrochemical Transfer Halo&#8208;thiolation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization reaction, in which two chemically distinct functional groups are transferred between two molecules, has long been an unmet goal due to the daunting challenges in controlling the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. Herein, we disclose an electrochemistry enabled shuttle reaction (  e  &#8208;shuttle) to selectively transfer one RS  &#8210;  and one X  &#8210;  group between &#946;&#8208;halosulfide and unsaturated hydrocarbons via a consecutive paired electrolysis mechanism. The preferential anodic oxidation of one anion over the other, which is controlled by their distinct redox potentials, plays a pivotal role in controlling the high chemoselectivity of the process. This easily scalable methodology enables the construction of a myriad of densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;halo alkenyl sulfides in unprecedented chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity using benign surrogates, e.g., 2&#8208;bromoethyl sulfide, avoiding the handling of corrosive and oxidative RS&#8211;Br reagents. In a broader context, these results open up new strategies for selective shuttle difunctionalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Induces Symmetry Breaking in Layered Dipeptide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of symmetry breaking of materials provides large opportunities to regulate their properties and functions. Herein, we report breaking the symmetry of layered dipeptide crystals by utilizing CO2&#160;  to induce the adjacent monomolecular layers to stack from the opposite to the same direction. The role of CO2  is to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. Further, the dipeptide crystals exhibit far superior piezoelectricity after symmetry breaking and the piezoelectric voltage generated from the dipeptide&#8208;based generators becomes more than 500% higher than before. This work reveals a potential route to engineer structures and properties of layered materials and provides a deep insight into the control of non&#8208;covalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens for In Vivo Theranostics of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimized theranostic strategy for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) remains almost vacant from bench to clinic. Current probes and drugs attempting to prevent &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrosis encountered failures due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration challenge and blind intervention time window. Herein, we designed a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, via balanced hydrophobicity&#8208;hydrophilicity. DNTPH binds selectively to A&#946; fibrils with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In vivo imaging revealed its excellent BBB permeability and long&#8208;term tracking ability with high&#8208;performance AD diagnosis. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis and fibril disassembly thereby attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity. DNTPH treatment significantly reduced A&#946; plaques and rescued learning deficits in AD mice. Thus, DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for real&#8208;time NIR imaging of A&#946; plaques and AD therapy simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Electrochemical Peptide Modifications: Unlocking New Levels of Orthogonality for Side&#8208;Chain Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical transformations provide enticing opportunities for programmable, residue&#8208;specific peptide modifications. Herein, we harness the potential of amidic side&#8208;chains as underutilized handles for late&#8208;stage modification through the development of an electroauxiliary&#8208;assisted oxidation of glutamine residues within unprotected peptides. Glutamine building blocks bearing electroactive side&#8208;chain N,S&#8208;acetals are incorporated into peptides using standard Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. Anodic oxidation of the electroauxiliary in the presence of diverse alcohol nucleophiles enables the installation of high&#8208;value N,O&#8208;acetal functionalities.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical transformations provide enticing opportunities for programmable, residue-specific peptide modifications. Herein, we harness the potential of amidic side-chains as underutilized handles for late-stage modification through the development of an electroauxiliary-assisted oxidation of glutamine residues within unprotected peptides. Glutamine building blocks bearing electroactive side-chain N,S-acetals are incorporated into peptides using standard Fmoc-SPPS. Anodic oxidation of the electroauxiliary in the presence of diverse alcohol nucleophiles enables the installation of high-value N,O-acetal functionalities. Proof-of-principle for an electrochemical peptide stapling protocol, as well as the functionalization of dynorphin B, an endogenous opioid peptide, demonstrates the applicability of the method to intricate peptide systems. Finally, the site-selective and tunable electrochemical modification of a peptide bearing two discretely oxidizable sites is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Deep Eutectic Solvents with TEMPO&#8208;based Polymer Electrodes: Influence of Molar Ratio on Electrode Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For sustainable energy storage, all&#8208;organic batteries based on redox&#8208;active polymers promise to become an alternative to lithium ion batteries. Yet, polymers contribute to the goal of an all&#8208;organic cell as electrodes or as solid electrolytes. Here, we replace the electrolyte with a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of&#160;sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) and&#160;N&#8208;methylacetamide (NMA), while using&#160;poly(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;oxyl methacrylate) (PTMA) as cathode. The successful combination of a DES with a polymer electrode is reported here for the first time. The electrochemical stability of PTMA electrodes in the DES at the eutectic molar ratio of 1:6 is comparable to conventional battery electrolytes. More viscous electrolytes with higher salt concentration can hinder cycling at high rates. Lower salt concentration leads to decreasing capacities and faster decomposition. The eutectic mixture of 1:6 is best suited uniting high stability and moderate viscosity.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode with 96% Utilization Rate Enabled by Solvation Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZBs) show promises for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is generally low due to side reactions in the aqueous electrolyte caused by the active water molecules. Here, we design a novel solvation structure in the electrolyte by introduction of sulfolane (SL). Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and experimental tests show that SL remodels the primary solvation shell of Zn2+, which significantly reduces the side reactions of Zn anode and achieves high ZURs under large capacities. Specifically, the symmetric and asymmetric cells could achieve a maximum of 96% ZUR at an areal capacity of 24 mAh cm&#8208;2. In a ZUR of 67%, the developed Zn&#8208;V2O5 full cell can be stably cycled for 500 cycles with an energy density of 180 Wh kg&#8208;1 and Zn&#8208;AC capacitor is stable for 5000 cycles. This electrolyte structural engineering strategy provides new insight into achieving high ZURs of Zn anodes for high performance AZBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A De Novo&#8208;Designed Type 3 Copper Protein Tunes Catechol Substrate Recognition and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>De novo metalloprotein design is a remarkable approach to shape protein scaffolds toward specific functions. Here, we report the design and characterization of Due Rame 1 (DR1), a de novo designed protein housing a di&#8208;copper site and mimicking the Type 3 (T3) copper&#8208;containing polyphenol oxidases (PPOs).
To achieve this goal, we hierarchically designed the first and the second di&#8208;metal coordination spheres to engineer the di&#8208;copper site into a simple four&#8208;helix bundle scaffold. Spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and functional characterization revealed that DR1 recapitulates the T3 copper site, supporting different copper redox states, and being active in the O  2  &#8208;dependent oxidation of catechols to  o  &#8208;quinones. Careful design of the residues lining the substrate access site endows DR1 with substrate recognition, as revealed by Hammet analysis and computational studies on substituted catechols. This study represents a premier example in the construction of a functional T3 copper site into a designed four&#8208;helix bundle protein.</dc:description>

         <title>A Polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;Containing Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor&#160;Enables Self&#8208;Stratification in Organic&#160;Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elaborate control of the vertical phase distribution within an active layer is critical to ensuring the high performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), but is challenging. Herein, a self&#8208;stratification active layer is realised by adding a novel polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing non&#8208;fullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptor (NFSMA), EH&#8208;C8F17, as the guest into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. A favourable vertical morphology was obtained with an upper acceptor&#8208;enriched thin layer and a lower undisturbed bulk heterojunction layer. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency of 18.03% was achieved, higher than the efficiency of 17.40% for the device without EH&#8208;C8F17. Additionally, benefiting from the improved charge transport and collection realised by this self&#8208;stratification strategy, the OSC with a thickness of 350 nm had an impressive PCE of 16.89%. The results of the study indicate that polyfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing NFSMA&#8208;assisted self&#8208;stratification within the active layer is effective for realising an ideal morphology for high&#8208;performance OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Fluorinated Solvation Shell and Low Salt Concentration Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concentration of electrolyte has significant effects on performances of rechargeable batteries. Previous studies mainly focused on concentrated electrolytes. So far, only several recipes on low&#8208;concentration electrolytes were studied, performing enhanced performance in advanced rechargeable batteries. Here, based on common electrolyte components, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte composed of 0.2 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solvated in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) is employed for high&#8208;voltage Li metal battery. The synergistic working mechanisms of introducing fluorine&#8208;containing solvent in the solvated structure and low salt concentration effect are revealed, resulting in LiF&#8208;rich, uniform, and robust solid electrolyte interphase layer and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. As a result, this low&#8208;concentration electrolyte significantly enhances electrochemical performances of Li||Li symmetric cells and high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2||Li batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytically stable potassium single&#8208;atom solid superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid superbases can catalyze diverse reactions under mild conditions, while they suffer from aggregation of basic sites and poor stability during recycling. Here we report a new generation of solid superbases derived from K single atoms (SAs) prepared by a tandem redox strategy. The initial redox reaction takes place between base precursor KNO3 and graphene support, producing K2O at 400 oC. Further increasing the temperature to 800 oC, the graphene reduces K2O to K anchored by its vacancies, leading to the generation of K SAs (denoted as K1/G). The source of basicity in the K1/G is K SAs, and neighboring single atoms (NSAs) possess superbasicity, which is different from conventional basicity originated from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Due to the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of basic sites, the K1/G shows excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reaction, which is much superior to the reported catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Carbonylation&#8208;Cyclization of Enallenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With electricity as green oxidant, a catalytic amount of benzoquinone (BQ) was used as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) in palladium&#8208;based electrocatalysis to provide highly efficient access to &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones skeletons in an undivided cell. This represents the first successful example of an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of allenes.







Abstract
Herein, we report an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation&#8208;carbocyclization of enallenols to afford &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones, which proceeds with excellent chemoselectivity. Interestingly, electrocatalysis was found to have an accelerating effect on the rate of the tandem process, leading to a more efficient reaction than that under chemical redox conditions.

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiTFSI&#8208;TMP&#8208;H2O electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stable window of 3.7&#8197;V are rationally designed by controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry. Benefiting from reduced H2O activity and reinforced solid electrolyte interphase, the assembled water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cell with a limited P/N ratio of 1.14 can achieve a long cycling life with high coulombic efficiency.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3.0&#8197;V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000&#8197;times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.

         <title>Structural Engineering toward Gold Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally well&#8208;defined gold nanoclusters are promising catalysts, and their molecular nature facilitates the design and controlled synthesis of cluster catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the strategies for constructing active sites and the effects of the ligands on cluster catalysis. The challenges and key future issues regarding catalytic applications of gold nanoclusters are discussed.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters provide great opportunities to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of nanogold catalysts. A nanocluster consists of a metal core and a surface ligand shell, and both the core and shell have significant effects on the catalytic properties.

&lt;p&gt;Structurally well-defined gold nanoclusters are promising catalysts, and their molecular nature facilitates the design and controlled synthesis of cluster catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically precise gold nanoclusters provide great opportunities to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of nanogold catalysts. A nanocluster consists of a metal core and a surface ligand shell, and both the core and shell have significant effects on the catalytic properties. Thanks to their precise structures, the active metal site of the clusters can be readily identified and the effects of ligands on catalysis can be disclosed.

         <title>Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Responsive Polymeric Photocatalysts for Enhanced Control and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive photocatalytic materials have emerged that are not only able to efficiently catalyze reactions but can use external stimuli to modulate their physical properties. This technique has been used to control the reactivity of a photocatalytic material turning it on/off. Moreover, photocatalytic materials have been synthesized which can be easily recycled with the use of an external trigger.







Abstract
The emergence of heterogeneous photocatalysis has facilitated redox reactions with high efficiency, without compromising the recyclability of the photocatalyst. Recently, stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic materials have emerged as a powerful synthetic tool, with simple and rapid recovery, as well as an enhanced dynamic control over reactions. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are often inexpensive and easy to produce. They can be switched from an active &#8220;on&#8221; state to an inert &#8220;off&#8221; state in response to external stimuli, allowing the production of photocatalyst with adaptability, recyclability, and orthogonal control on different chemical reactions. Despite this versatility, the application of artificial smart material in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has not yet been maximized. In this Minireview, we will examine the recent developments of this emerging class of stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic systems. We will discuss the synthesis route of appending photoactive components into different triggerable systems and, in particular, the controlled activation and recovery of the materials.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Learning Framework for the Automated Recognition of Molecules in Scanning&#8208;Probe&#8208;Microscopy Images</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a deep&#8208;learning framework to automatically analyse scanning&#8208;probe&#8208;microscopy data, which requires only a small number of image samples to achieve high accuracy. This work provides a strategy to accelerate data mining and the discovery of new materials.







Abstract
Computer vision as a subcategory of deep learning tackles complex vision tasks by dealing with data of images. Molecular images with exceptionally high resolution have been achieved thanks to the development of techniques like scanning probe microscopy (SPM). However, extracting useful information from SPM image data requires careful analysis which heavily relies on human supervision. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework using an advanced computer vision algorithm, Mask R&#8208;CNN, to address the challenge of molecule detection, classification and instance segmentation in binary molecular nanostructures. We employ the framework to determine two triangular&#8208;shaped molecules of similar STM appearance. Our framework could accurately differentiate two molecules and label their positions. We foresee that the application of computer vision in SPM images will become an indispensable part in the field, accelerating data mining and the discovery of new materials.

         <title>Complexed Semiconductor Cores Activate Hexaniobate Ligands as Nucleophilic Sites for Solar&#8208;Light Reduction of CO2 by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkably rapid CO2 reduction by solar light and water is achieved using molecular analogs of metal&#8208;oxide intercalated niobate nanosheets.







Abstract
Although pure and functionalized solid&#8208;state polyniobates such as layered perovskites and niobate nanosheets are photocatalysts for renewable&#8208;energy processes, analogous reactions by molecular polyoxoniobate cluster&#8208;anions are nearly absent from the literature. We now report that under simulated solar light, hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anion encapsulated 30&#8208;NiII&#8208;ion &#8220;fragments&#8221; of surface&#8208;protonated cubic&#8208;phase&#8208;like NiO cores activate the hexaniobate ligands towards CO2 reduction by water. Photoexcitation of the NiO cores promotes charge&#8208;transfer reduction of NbV to NbIV, increasing electron density at bridging oxo atoms of Nb&#8208;&#956;&#8208;O&#8208;Nb linkages that bind and convert CO2 to CO. Photogenerated NiO &#8220;holes&#8221; simultaneously oxidize water to dioxygen. The findings point to molecular complexation of suitable semiconductor &#8220;fragments&#8221; as a general method for utilizing electron&#8208;dense polyoxoniobate anions as nucleophilic photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light driven activation and reduction of small molecules.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Outer&#8208;Shells for Sequentially Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, photocatalytic CO2&#8208;CO&#8208;CH4 conversion is realized by hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with hetero&#8208;shells. The enriched local CO concentration in inner shells and continuous protonation of CO on the outer&#8208;most shell enable the two&#8208;step tandem CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering hierarchical microreactors toward efficient tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Constructing delicate nano&#8208;/microreactors with tandem active sites in hierarchical architectures is a promising strategy for designing photocatalysts to realize the challenging but attractive CO2 reduction. Herein, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with spatial ordered hetero&#8208;shells are fabricated, which achieve two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction. The multiple inner CeO2 shells increase the number of active catalytic sites to ensure efficient first&#8208;step reaction for generating CO, along with enriching the local CO concentration. The second&#8208;step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction is consequently induced by amorphous TiO2 (A&#8208;TiO2) composites on the adjacent outer&#8208;most shell, thus realizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion capability using one CeO2@CeO2/A&#8208;TiO2 HoMS. In&#8208;depth explorations in the microreactors provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering HoMS&#8208;based microreactors with temporally&#8211;spatially ordered shells toward efficient tandem catalysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle (NP) level was investigated by ECL microscopy. The Au NPs were assembled into an ordered array, providing a high&#8208;throughput platform that can easily locate each NP in sequential characterizations. A strong dependence of ECL intensity on Au NP configurations was observed. We demonstrate for the first time that at the single&#8208;particle level, the ECL of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;TPrA was majorly quenched by small Au NPs (&lt; 40 nm), while enhanced by large Au ones (&gt; 80 nm) due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Notably, the ECL intensity was further increased by the coupling effect of neighboring Au NPs. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations conformed well with the experimental results. This plasmon enhanced ECL microscopy for arrayed single NPs provides a reliable tool for screening electrocatalytic activity at a single particle.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Mechanochemistry Unlocks The Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;Type Coupling of Aryl Sulfamates at Different Scales</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several mechanochemically heated processes have been published in recent years. However, precise control over the mechanochemical catalysed coupling reactions remained elusive. A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co&#8208;workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater manifold delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species. This methodology can be readily upscaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective Activation of Toll&#8208;Like Receptor&#160;7/8 Agonist Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Generates Safe Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Responses upon Systemic Administration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Agonists of innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs) prime adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immunity and hold promise for cancer immunotherapy. However, small&#8208;molecule TLR agonists cause immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) after systemic administration. Herein, we report&#160;a polymeric nano&#8208;immunomodulator&#160;(cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within the tumor. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ was obtained via&#160;self&#8208;assembly of a cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys)&#8208;modified amphiphilic copolymeric prodrug. Upon systemic administration,&#160;cN@SS&#8208;IMQ preferentially accumulated at tumor sites&#160;and&#160;responded to high intracellular glutathione levels&#160;to release native imidazoquinolines&#160;for dendritic cell maturation, thereby enhancing the infiltration of T lymphocytes. Collectively, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ tends to activate the immune system without irAEs, thus suggesting its promising potential for safe systemic targeting delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crosslinked Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Iodine and Iodide Remediation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine is widely used as an antimicrobial reagent for water disinfection in the wilderness and outer space, but residual iodine and iodide need to be removed for health reasons. Currently, it is challenging to remove low concentrations of iodine and iodide in water (~5 ppm). Furthermore, the remediation of iodine and iodide across a broad temperature range (up to 90 &#176;C) has not previously been investigated. In this work, we report a nitrate dimer&#8208;directed synthesis of a single&#8208;crystalline ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7). HCOF&#8208;7 removes iodine and iodide species in water efficiently through halogen bonding and anion exchange, reducing the total iodine concentration to 0.22 ppm at room temperature. Packed HCOF&#8208;7 columns were employed for iodine/iodide breakthrough experiments between 23 and 90 &#176;C, and large breakthrough volumes were recorded (&#8805;18.3 L/g). The high iodine/iodide removal benchmarks recorded under practical conditions make HCOF&#8208;7 a promising adsorbent for water treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Imine Directed Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8211;H Functionalization and Annulation with Amino Amides, Aldehydes, and Diazo&#160;Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multicomponent annulation that proceeds by imine directed Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8211;H functionalization is disclosed. The transformation affords piperazinones displaying a range of functionality and is the first example of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent N&#8211;H functionalization. A broad range of readily available &#945;&#8208;amino amides, including those derived from glycine, &#945;&#8208;substituted, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids, were effective inputs and enabled the incorporation of a variety of amino acid side chains with minimal racemization. Branched and unbranched alkyl aldehydes and various stabilized diazo compounds were also efficient reactants. The piperazinone products were further modified through efficient transformations. Mechanistic studies, including X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization of a catalytically competent five&#8208;membered rhodacycle with imine and amide nitrogen chelation, provide support for the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable White Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Based on Chiral Co&#8208;assembled Helix Nanofiber Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>White circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs)are of great significance in potential lighting sources and full&#8208;color 3D displays. However, High&#8208;performance white CP&#8208;EL sources are almost unexplored. We have constructed full&#8208;color CP&#8208;EL devices based on chiral co&#8208;assemblies by using three achiral conjugated pyrene&#8208;based dyes (BP, w&#8208;WPandc&#8208;WP)  doped with chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based enantiomers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M) as the EMLs through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 films exhibitregular helix nanofibers under annealing treatment and emit strong white CPL. Significantly, remarkable CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on(S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 were achieved with |gEL| values as high as 6.2 &#215; 10&#8208;2 and an excellent CRI of 98 at the CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). These are the highest gEL and CRI values of reported CP&#8208;WOLEDs to date. This is the first achievement of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on chiral co&#8208;assembled helix nanofiber emitters,and provides a valuable strategy with which to develop white CP&#8208;EL for future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Enzyme Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme immobilization is a widely reported manner to favor the applicability of enzyme by enhancing their stability and re&#8208;usability. Among the various existing solid&#8208;supports and immobilization strategies, the in&#8208;situ encapsulation of enzyme within crystalline porous matrices is a powerful tool to design biohybrid with a stable and protected catalytic activity. However, to date, only a few metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been reported. Excitingly, for the first time, Y. Chen and coworkers expanded the in&#8208;situ bio&#8208;encapsulation to a new class of crystalline porous material, namely covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The enzyme@COF materials not only exhibited high enzyme loading with minimal leaching, high catalytic activity and selectivity, chemical and long&#8208;term stability and recyclability but could also be scaled up to a few grams. Undoubtedly, this works opens striking new opportunities for enzymatic immobilization and will stimulate new research on COF based matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Double Hydrosilylation of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double hydrosilylation of alkynes represents a straightforward method to synthesize bis(silane)s, yet it is challenging if &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylsilanes act as the intermediates. Here, a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent double hydrosilylation of arylacetylenes is reported for the first time involving this challenge, accessing both vicinal and geminal bis(silane)s with exclusive regioselectivity. Various novel bis(silane)s containing Si&#8211;H bonds can be easily obtained. The gram&#8208;scale reactions could be performed smoothly. Preliminarily mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reactions were initiated by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of alkynes, followed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydrosilylation of the &#945;&#8208;vinylsilanes to deliver vicinal bis(silane)s, or hydride&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation to give geminal ones.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Double hydrosilylation of alkynes represents a straightforward method to synthesize bis(silane)s, yet it is challenging if &#945;-substituted vinylsilanes act as the intermediates. Here, a cobalt-catalyzed regiodivergent double hydrosilylation of arylacetylenes is reported for the first time involving this challenge, accessing both vicinal and geminal bis(silane)s with exclusive regioselectivity. Various novel bis(silane)s containing Si&#8211;H bonds can be easily obtained. The gram-scale reactions could be performed smoothly. Preliminarily mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reactions were initiated by cobalt-catalyzed &#945;-hydrosilylation of alkynes, followed by cobalt-catalyzed &#946;-hydrosilylation of the &#945;-vinylsilanes to deliver vicinal bis(silane)s, or hydride-catalyzed &#945;-hydrosilylation to give geminal ones. Notably, these bis(silane)s can be used for the synthesis of high-refractive-index polymers (nd up to 1.83), demonstrating great potential utility in optical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Directed Automated Mannoside Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Automated glycan assembly (AGA) on solid support has become invaluable in reconciling the biological importance of complex carbohydrates with the persistent challenges associated with reproducible synthesis. Whilst AGA platforms have transformed the construction of many natural sugars, validation in the construction of well&#8208;defined (Site&#8208;selectively modified) glycomimetics is in its infancy. Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, the biomedical prominence of 2&#8208;fluoro sugars and the remarkable selectivities observed in fluorine&#8208;directed glycosylation, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (FDAGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the fluorine atom for stereocontrolled glycosylation on solid support, thereby eliminating the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. The logical design of C2&#8208;fluorinated mannose building blocks, and their application in the fully (&#945;&#8208;)stereocontrolled automated assembly of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannosides, is disclosed. This operationally simple strategy can be integrated into existing AGA and post&#8208;AGA protocols to augment the scope of programmed carbohydrate synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Hybrid Functional Fluoropolymers Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;controlled polymerizations are attractive to tailor macromolecules of complex compositions with spatiotemporal regulation. In this work, with a convenient synthesis for trifluorovinyl boronic ester (TFVB), we report a light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed copolymerization of vinyl monomers and TFVB for the first time, which enabled the controlled synthesis of a variety of hybrid fluorine/boron polymers with low dispersities and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The good behaviors of &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch, chain&#8208;extension polymerizations and post&#8208;modifications further highlight the versatility and reliability of this copolymerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of fluorine and boron could furnish copolymer electrolytes of high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (up to 0.83), bringing new opportunities of engineering high&#8208;performance materials for energy storage purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Electrospinning Nanofiber Membranes with pH&#8208;regulated Ion Gating for Tunable Osmotic Power Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological ion channels existing in organisms are critical for many biological processes. Inspired by biological ion channels, the heterogeneous electrospinning nanofiber membranes (HENM) with functional ion channels are constructed by electrospinning technology. The HENM successfully realizes ion&#8208;gating effects, which can be used for tunable energy conversions. Introduction of pyridine and carboxylic acid groups into the HENM plays an important role in generating unique and stable ion transport behaviors, in which gates become alternative states of open and close, responding to symmetric/asymmetric pH stimulations. Then we used the HENM to convert osmotic energy into electric energy which reach a maximum value up to 12.34 W m&#8208;2 and the output power density of HENM&#8208;based system could be regulated by ion&#8208;gating effects. The properties of the HENM provide widespread potentials in application of smart nanofluidic devices, energy conversion, and water treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Multilayered Ceramic Membrane with Ion Conducting Thin Layer Induced by Interface Reaction for Stable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional methods for fabricating multilayered ceramic membranes with ion conducting dense thin layers are often cumbersome, costly, and limited by poor adhesion between layers. Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, here, we report an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2&#8208;&#948; (CGO) thin layers rooted in the parent multilayered ceramic membranes by only one firing step. The CGO dense layers are very thin, and adhered strongly to the parent support layer, ensuring low ionic transport resistance and structural integrity of the multilayered membranes. When using as an oxygen permeable membrane for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen, it shows very long durability in harsh conditions containing H2O, CH4, H2, CO2 and H2S. Furthermore, our approach is highly scalable and applicable to a wide variety of ion conducting thin layers, including Y0.08Zr0.92O2&#8208;&#948;, Ce0.9Sm0.1O2&#8208;&#948; and Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8208;&#948;.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Interfacial Layers Based on Mechanically Interlocked Networks Capable of Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has received considerable attention due to its vital role in stabilizing Li anode. However, native and many artificial SEIs often suffer from cracking and fragmentation under dendrite impact or long&#8208;term repeated volume variation, causing capacity decay. Herein, a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) was innovatively designed as interfacial layer to protect Li anode by incorporating the unique energy dissipation capability, which helps Li anode survive repeated volume variation during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, symmetric cell with MIN&#8208;coated Li anode (MIN@Li) exhibited prolonged cycling life of 1500 hours at 1 mA/cm2. The full cell using LFP cathode (13.5 mg/cm2) cycled stably for 500 cycles with capacity retention over 88% (1 C). Our results highlight a creative application of MIN in Li anode, and its unique energy dissipation capability promises future success in other battery fields suffering from repeated volume variations.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Density Overcomes Steric Hindrance of Ferrocene Surfactant in Switchable Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ferrocene surfactant can be switched between single and double head form (FcN+C12/Fc+N+C12) triggered by redox reactions. FcN+C12 can neither stabilize an O/W emulsion alone nor an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion in combination with alumina nanoparticles due to the steric hindrance of the ferrocene group. However, such steric hindrance can be overcome by increasing the charge density in Fc+N+C12, so that oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions can be co&#8208;stabilized by the Fc+N+C12 and alumina nanoparticles at very low concentrations (1&#215;10&#8208;7 M (~50 ppb) and 0.001 wt.%, respectively). Not only reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions could be achieved by redox reactions, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be obtained through reversing the charge of alumina particles by adjusting the pH. The results provide a new protocol for the design of surfactants for stabilization of smart oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternately &#960;&#8208;Stacked Systems Assisted by o&#8208;Carborane: Dual Excimer Emission and Color Modulation by Bcage&#8211;Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we report unique solid&#8208;state excimer emission of three types of acridine&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carboranes with variable degrees of methylation at the o&#8208;carborane unit. They all showed columnar packing structures based on a dimer formation, and two types of &#960;&#8208;overlapping motifs were alternately stacked. From the photoluminescence (PL) measurements with the crystalline samples, it was found that three types of luminescent bands can simultaneously appear; monomer emission, excimer emission from the moderately &#960;&#8208;stacked intra&#8208;dimer unit, and excimer emission from the widely &#960;&#8208;stacked inter&#8208;dimer unit. Consequently, the PL colors were drastically changed by the steric effect by methyl groups, showing a strong correlation between &#960;&#8208;overlapping fashion and excimer character. In addition, variable&#8208;temperature PL measurements revealed that these PL species should be in thermal equilibrium at room temperature, and the intensity ratios were sensitive toward temperature changes. Finally, we observed thermochromic luminescent properties from the crystalline samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Thionation of Epoxides for Enantioselective Synthesis of Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanding the enzymatic toolbox for green synthesis of valuable molecules is still of high interest in synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical industry. Chiral thiiranes are valuable sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, while relevant enantioselective synthetic methods are limited. Herein, we report a biocatalytic thionation strategy for enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes, which was developed based on the halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with thiocyanate and a subsequent nonenzymatic rearrangement process. A novel HHDH was identified and engineered for enantioselective bio&#8208;thionation of various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted epoxides at preparative scale, affording the corresponding thiiranes in up to 43% isolated yield and 98% enantiomeric excess (ee). The large&#8208;scale synthesis and useful transformations of chiral thiiranes were also performed to demonstrate the utility and scalability of the bio&#8208;thionation strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Effect to Promote Reaction Kinetics and Overall Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under External Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin polarization in CoSx loading on carbon nanofibers obtained by electrospinning method regulate LiPS conversion reaction. The external magnetic field induces electron spin polarization in CoSx, reducing electron repulsion, and enhancing the degree of 2p&#8211;3d orbital hybridization, thus accelerating the conversion ability of lithium polysulfides and enabling carbon nanofiber/CoSx/S cathodes with unprecedented performance and stability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are still limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the slow Li&#8722;S reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that when using cobalt sulfide as a catalytic additive, an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the LiPS adsorption ability and the Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics. More specifically, the results show both experimentally and theoretically how an electron spin polarization of Co ions reduces electron repulsion and enhances the degree of orbital hybridization, thus resulting in LSBs with unprecedented performance and stability. Under an external magnetic field, LSBs with 0.0084&#8201;% per cycle decay rate at 2&#8197;C during 8150&#8197;cycles are produced. Overall, this work not only demonstrates an effective strategy to promote LiPS adsorption and electrochemical conversion in LSBs at no additional energy cost but also enriches the application of the spin effect in the electrocatalysis fields.

         <title>Efficient Splitting of Alkane Isomers by a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Auxetic Reentrant Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy&#8208;efficient separation of alkane isomers for gasoline upgrading using Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with auxetic reentrant pore structures is reported by Dan Zhao et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211808). The honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows of the pore structure lead to a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and to high capacities for other isomers.

         <title>Edge&#8208;to&#8208;Center Propagation of Photochemical Reaction during Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Photomechanical Transformation of 2,5&#8208;Distyrylpyrazine Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomechanical molecular crystals are promising materials as photon&#8208;powered artificial actuators. To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photomechanical molecular crystals are promising materials as photon-powered artificial actuators. To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5-distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single-crystal-to-single-crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge-to-center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Broadband Photoresponses from Ultraviolet to Near&#8208;Infrared (II) Region through Light&#8208;induced Pyroelectric Effects in a Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadband photodetection has shown a great promise for diverse applications, while the realization of plateau photoresponse from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is very challenging. Herein, we exploit photoexcited pyroelectric effect in a chiral hybrid perovskite, (N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylcyclohexylammonium)PbBr3  (1), serving as a new pathway to drive broadband photoactivities. It is a room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric with large polarization of ~6.4 &#956;C cm&#8208;2  and high pyroelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits (F  V  =1.0&#215;10&#8208;2  cm2  &#956;C&#8208;1  and  F  D  =7.1&#215;10  &#8208;5  Pa&#8208;1/2  ). Strikingly, light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect arising from spontaneous polarization is observed in  1  , which cover UV (266 nm) to NIR&#8208;II (1950 nm) full spectral region. The broadband photoresponses actualized by pyroelectricity break the limit of optical bandgap. As the first demonstration of photo&#8208;pyroelectricity covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral region in hybrid perovskites, this work paves a pathway to assemble high&#8208;performance smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Observation of C&#8208;C Coupling and Step Poisoning during the Growth of Hydrocarbon Chains on Ni(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of high&#8208;value fuels and plastics starting from small hydrocarbon molecules plays a central role in the current transition towards renewable energy. However, the detailed mechanisms driving the growth of hydrocarbon chains remain to a large extent still unknown. Here we investigated the formation of hydrocarbon chains resulting from acetylene polymerization on a Ni(111) model catalyst surface. Exploiting X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy up to near&#8208;ambient pressures, the intermediate species and reaction products have been identified. Complementary  in&#8208;situ  scanning tunneling microscopy observations shed light onto the C&#8209;C coupling mechanism. While the step edges of the metal catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for the C&#8209;C coupling, we showed that the polymerization occurs instead on the flat terraces of the metallic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations and Implications for Catalysis of Quasi&#8208;d10 Configurations in Formal Gold(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several gold +I and +III complexes are investigated computationally and spectroscopically, focusing on the d&#8208;configuration and physical oxidation state of the metal center. Density functional theory calculations reveal the non&#8208;negligible electron&#8208;sharing covalent character of the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#963;&#8208;bonding framework. The bonding scenarios of gold(III) are shown to be isoelectronic to the formal copper(III) complex [Cu(CF3)4]1&#8208;, in which the metal center attempts to populate its formally unoccupied 3d&#173;x2&#8208;y2 orbital via &#963;&#8209;bonding, which has been used to support the idea of an inverted ligand field, resulting in a reduced d10 Cu(I) description. However, we use Au L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to show that excitation into the d&#8208;orbital manifold of the gold(III) complexes is still possible, demonstrating that a genuine d10 configuration is not achieved. We also find increased electron&#8208;sharing nature of the &#963;&#8209;bonds in the gold(I) species, relative to their silver(I) and copper(I) analogues, due to the low&#8208;lying 6s orbital. Based on the identified bonding motifs, we identify two distinct modes of action relevant to gold catalysis. We propose that these lead to gold +I and +III complexes forming similar bonds with substrates, owing primarily to either participation of the 5d&#173;x2&#8208;y2 or 6s orbital in bonding, respectively. This sheds light on why gold complexes in these two oxidation states often exhibit similar reactivity. We reflect on the implications of this analysis for the future of gold(III) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Waste plastics represent major environmental and economic burdens due to their ubiquity, slow breakdown rates, and inadequacy of current recycling routes. Polyethylenes are particularly problematic, because they lack robust recycling approaches despite being the most abundant plastics in use today. We report a novel chemical and biological approach for the rapid conversion of polyethylenes into structurally complex and pharmacologically active compounds. We present conditions for aerobic, catalytic digestion of polyethylenes collected from post&#8208;consumer and oceanic waste streams, creating carboxylic diacids that can then be used as a carbon source by the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. As a proof of principle, we have engineered strains of A. nidulans to synthesize the fungal secondary metabolites asperbenzaldehyde, citreoviridin, and mutilin when grown on these digestion products. This hybrid approach considerably expands the catalog of products to which polyethylenes can be upcycled.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Europium for Operando Catalyst Thermometry in an Exothermic Chemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Often the reactor or the reaction medium temperature is reported in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, even though it could vary significantly from the reactive catalyst temperature. The influence of the catalyst temperature on the catalytic performance and vice versa is therefore not always accurately known. We here apply EuOCl as both solid catalyst and thermometer, allowing for operando temperature determination. The interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics is studied. A maximum temperature difference between the catalyst and oven of +16 &#176;C was observed due to the exothermicity of the methane oxychlorination reaction. Heat dissipation by radiation appears dominating compared to convection in this set&#8208;up, explaining the observed uniform catalyst bed temperature. Application of operando catalyst thermometry could provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of catalyst performances and allow for safer process operation in chemical industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Charge Transport in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites The Key towards High&#8208;Anisotropy in Circularly&#8208;Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free chiral perovskites is introduced towards the detection of circularly polarized light (CPL). Although spin&#8208;polarized carriers are generated in the perovskites under the CPL, the absorption anisotropy remained low leading to mostly similar density of photogenerated carriers under the two CPLs. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic chirality in the perovskites, they exhibited chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) allowing the transport of only one type of spin&#8208;half states. A high anisotropy in photocurrent along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction has therefore appeared resulting in a spin&#8208;dependent photovoltaic effect in vertical heterojunction devices and making them suitable for CPL detection. While a self&#8208;powered CPL detector showed a limited (but one of the highest to date) anisotropy factor of 0.3 due to possible spin&#8208;flips during the transport process, the factor rose to 0.6 under bias prompting extension of the effective spin&#8208;diffusion length.</dc:description>

         <title>The Marriage of Sierpi&#324;ski Triangle and Platonic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fractal structures with self&#8208;similarity are of fundamental importance in the fields of aesthetic, chemistry and mathematics. Here, by taking advantages of constructs the rational geometry&#8208;directed precursor design, we report the construction of two fascinating Platonic solids, the Sierpi&#324;ski tetrahedron ST&#8208;T and the Sierpi&#324;ski octahedron ST&#8208;O, in which each possesses a fractal Sierpi&#324;ski triangle on their independent faces. These two discrete complexes are formed in near&#8208;quantitative yield from the multi&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly of truncated Sierpi&#324;ski triangular kernel L1 with tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;based hexatopic and anthracene&#8208;based tetratopic terpyridine ligands (L3 and L4) in the presence of metal ions, respectively. The enhanced stabilities of the 3D discrete structures were investigated by gradient tandem mass spectrometry (gMS2). This work provides new constructs for the imitation of complex virus assemblies and for the molecular encapsulation of giant guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Conversion of Microplastics to Methane with Ultrahigh Selectivity by Biotic&#8722;Abiotic Hybrid Photocatalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient conversion of microplastics into fuels provides a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and energy crisis. However, the conventional processes are challenged by low product selectivity and potential secondary pollution. Herein, a biotic&#8722;abiotic photocatalytic system is designed by assembling  Methanosarcina barkeri  (  M. b  ) and carbon dot&#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitrides (CDPCN), by which biodegradable microplastics &#8722; poly(lactic acid) after heat pretreatment can be converted into CH  4  for five successive 24&#8208;day cycles with nearly 100% CH  4  selectivity by the assistance of additional CO  2  . Mechanistic analyses showed that both photooxidation and photoreduction methanogenesis worked simultaneously via the fully utilizing photogenerated holes and electrons without chemical sacrificial quenchers. Further research validated the real&#8208;world applicability of  M. b  &#8208;CDPCN for non&#8208;biodegradable microplastic&#8208;to&#8208;CH  4  conversion, offering a new avenue for engineering the plastic reuse.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly: Fabrication and Visualization of Multiblock Microstructures
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent multiblock microcolumns are fabricated relying on the cooperation between the controllable host&#8208;guest complexation of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and AIEgen guest and the hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on CB[8], NaBr and AIEgen guest. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly to be visualized, understood, and regulated.







Abstract
Due to the fast dynamics and re&#8208;equilibration of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, bottom&#8208;up molecular strategies to fabricate well&#8208;defined and controllable multiblock structures are rare. Herein, we propose a new concept for fabrication of fluorescent multiblock microcolumns containing 1 to 7 blocks via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), NaBr and an AIEgen guest. Through the complexation between CB[8] and different numbers of AIEgen guests (2, 1, 0), the competitive displacement caused by the binding of the sodium cation to the CB[8] portal, and the reversible assembly of positively charged guests in salt solutions, one&#8208;pot hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is realized. The molecular structure of each block is analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly of multiblocks to be visualized, understood, and regulated.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Selective Amide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the selective activation of amides has flourished over the last decades. In the past four years, this area has become a rapidly developing domain. This Minireview aims to highlight the breakthroughs in amide activation achieved since 2018, with a focus on significant advances in electrophilic and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed amide activation, as well as other strategies on amide activation and functionalisation.







Abstract
In contrast to ketones and carboxylic esters, amides are classically seen as comparatively unreactive members of the carbonyl family, owing to their unique structural and electronic features. However, recent decades have seen the emergence of research programmes focused on the selective activation of amides under mild conditions. In the past four years, this area has continued to rapidly develop, with new advances coming in at a fast pace. Several novel activation strategies have been demonstrated as effective tools for selective amide activation, enabling transformations that are at once synthetically useful and mechanistically intriguing. This Minireview comprises recent advances in the field, highlighting new trends and breakthroughs in what could be called a new age of amide activation.

         <title>Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For dynamic polymer materials to respond to their environment and be tailored towards an application, the timescale of bond exchange must be tuned. Both chemical structural modifications and external factors such as temperature, catalyst, and matrix can be used to fine&#8208;tune the timescales of exchange. This Review focuses on the tools available to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymeric materials.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine&#8208;tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This Review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, Thiol&#8211;Michael exchange, Diels&#8211;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This Review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials. Finally, this Review proposes strategies for tailoring the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymer materials through both kinetic effects and modulating bond thermodynamics.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Crotylation of Alcohol Proelectrophiles via Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Auto&#8208;Transfer Mediated by Methylallene and Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS&#8208;catalysts affect anti&#8208;crotylation of primary alcohols mediated by methylallene or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to provide polyketide propionate motifs. These C&#8722;C bond formations are byproduct&#8208;free and can be conducted in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;bound ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS complexes catalyze the redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;C coupling of primary alcohols with methylallene (1,2&#8208;butadiene) or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to form products of anti&#8208;crotylation with good to excellent levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Distinct from other methods, direct crotylation of primary alcohols in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols is possible, enabling generation of spirastrellolide&#8197;B (C9&#8211;C15) and leucascandrolide&#8197;A (C9&#8211;C15) substructures in significantly fewer steps than previously possible.

         <title>Confinement of the Triplet States in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated BODIPY Dimers Linked with Ethynylene or Butadiynylene Bridges: A Different View on the Effect of Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet wave functions of BODIPY dimers with symmetrically structured ethynylene or butadienylene linker are highly localized on one BODIPY moiety, which differs from previous findings for meso&#8208;to&#8208;meso porphyrin oligomers. This study provides a new understanding of triplet state confinement and molecular symmetry.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of the excited state wavefunction confinement is crucial for the engineering of the photophysical properties and applications of organic chromophores. In the present contribution, the localization of the triplet state wavefunctions of some symmetric ethyne/butadiyne bridged BODIPY dimers and asymmetric BODIPY derivatives presenting extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation frameworks is studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations. Based on the Zero Field Splitting D parameters, we conclude that the triplet state wavefunctions are highly localized on one BODIPY unit in the symmetric dimers, which is consistent with the ab initio modelling that finds delocalized triplet state destabilized by 12&#8211;14&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to its localized counterpart. The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemisorbing a prototypical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to a dense packed layer of metalloporphyrins pulls out complete metalloporphyrins into the second layer. This dynamic and reversible phenomenon unravels by structural, spectroscopic, desorption and theoretical investigations. The molecular rearrangement of the metallorganic layer is paralleled to NHCs pulling out single metal atoms from surfaces due to strong adsorption.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analysed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganisation can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalisation of surfaces with carbenes.

         <title>Steering the Ultrafast Opening and Closure Dynamics of a Photochromic Coordination Cage by Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast photodynamics of a dithienylethene&#8208;based coordination cage have been shown to vary depending on the nature of the encapsulated guest molecules. The ring&#8208;closure of the cage ligand can be suppressed through steric effects, while the reverse reaction competes with a population of the 3MLCT state that is enhanced by appropriate guest molecules.







Abstract
Photochemical studies on supramolecular hosts that can encapsulate small guest molecules commonly focus on three aspects: photoswitching the cage to release or trap the guest, the effect of the confining environment on the guest, and light&#8208;induced exciton or charge transfer within the cage structure. Here, we exploit ultrafast spectroscopy to address how the guest alters the photoswitching characteristics of the cage. For this, the impacts of three disparate guest compounds on ring&#8208;opening or ring&#8208;closure of a dithienylethene (DTE) ligand in a photoswitchable DTE&#8208;based coordination cage are juxtaposed. The guest modulates both outcome and timescale of the cage's photodynamics, by an interplay of structural strain, heavy&#8208;atom effect, and enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer processes exercised by the guest on the photo&#8208;excited cage. The approach might prove beneficial for attuning the applicability of photoswitchable nanocontainers and desired guest compounds.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Formation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Simultaneous Regulating Solvation Structures for Advanced Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries suffers from notorious dendrite growth, serious Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution. Here, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anode. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also  in&#8208;situ  produces a dense N&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer on Zn foils. This layer protects Zn foils from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn. Hence, the asymmetrical cells with NMP in the electrolyte retain a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 1000 cycles. The symmetric cells survive ~200 h for 10 mAh cm&#8208;2  at a high Zn utilization of 85.6%. The full cells of Zn||MnO2  show an impressive cumulative capacity even with lean electrolyte (E/C ratio = 10 &#956;L mAh&#8208;1), limited Zn&#160;supply (N/P ratio = 2.3) and high areal capacity (5.0 mAh cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Accelerating insoluble Li2S2&#8208;Li2S reduction catalysis to mitigate the shuttle effect has emerged as an innovative paradigm for high&#8208;efficient lithium&#8208;sulfur battery cathodes, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts by offering high&#8208;density active sites to realize in&#8208;situ reaction with solid Li2S2. However, the profound origin of diverse single&#8208;atom species on solid&#8208;solid sulfur reduction catalysis and modulation principles remains ambiguous. Here we disclose the fundamental origin of Li2S2&#8208;Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic elements&#8208;based single&#8208;atom materials to be from their spin density and magnetic moments. The experimental and theoretical studies disclose that the Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;based cathodes exhibit the fastest deposition kinetics of Li2S (226 mAh g&#8208;1) and the lowest thermodynamic energy barriers (0.56 eV). We believe that the accelerated Li2S2&#8208;Li2S reduction catalysis enabled via spin polarization of ferromagnetic atoms provides practical opportunities towards long&#8208;life batteries.</dc:description>

Here we disclose the fundamental origin of Li2S2-Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic elements-based single-atom materials to be from their spin density and magnetic moments. The experimental and theoretical studies disclose that the Fe-N4-based cathodes exhibit the fastest deposition kinetics of Li2S (226 mAh g-1) and the lowest thermodynamic energy barriers (0.56 eV). We believe that the accelerated Li2S2-Li2S reduction catalysis enabled via spin polarization of ferromagnetic atoms provides practical opportunities towards long-life batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Pair Design Strategy for Optimizing the Synergistic Electron Effects of Catalytic Sites in NO Selective Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective adsorption and speedy surface reactions are vital requirements for efficient active sites in catalysis, but it remains challenging to maximize these two functions simultaneously. We present a solution to this issue by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair catalytic sites with tunable electronic interactions. As a case study, NO selective reduction occurring on V1&#8208;W1/TiO2 is chosen. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic electron effect present between the paired atoms enriches high&#8208;energy spin charge around the Fermi level, simultaneously rendering reactant (NH3 or O2) adsorption more effective and subsequent surface reactions speedier as compared with single V or W atom alone, and hence higher reaction rates. This strategy enables us to rationally design a high&#8208;performance V1&#8208;Mo1/TiO2 catalyst with optimized vanadium(IV)&#8208;molybdenum(V) electronic interactions, which has exceptional activity significantly higher than the commercial or reported catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Assembly of the Tricyclic Labdane Core Enables Synthesis of Diverse Forskolin&#8208;like Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new synthetic strategy for the flexible preparation of forskolin&#8208;like molecules. The approach is different from the previously published works and employs a convergent assembly of the tricyclic labdane&#8208;type core from pre&#8208;functionalized cyclic building blocks. Stereoselective Michael addition enabled the fragment coupling with excellent control over three newly created contiguous stereocenters, all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers included. Silyl enol ether&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening metathesis paired with ring closure were the other key steps enabling concise assembly of the tricyclic core. Late&#8208;stage functionalization sequences transformed the tricyclic intermediates into a set of different forskolin&#8208;like molecules. The modular nature of the synthetic scheme described herein has the potential to become a general platform for the preparation of analogs of forskolin and other complex tricyclic labdanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Microfluidic Production of Ultrasmall Glyco Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;small gold nanoparticles (UAuNPs) are extremely interesting for applications in nanomedicine thanks to their good stability, biocompatibility, long circulation time and efficient clearance pathways. UAuNPs engineered with glycans (Glyco&#8208;UAuNPs) emerged as excellent platforms for many applications since the multiple copies of glycans can mimic the multivalent effect of glycoside clusters. Herein, we unravel a straightforward photo&#8208;induced synthesis of Glyco&#8208;UAuNPs based on a reliable and robust microfluidic approach. The synthesis occurs at room temperature avoiding the use of any further chemical reductant, templating agents or co&#8208;solvents. Exploiting 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, we showed that the amount of thiol&#8208;ligand exposed on the UAuNPs is linearly correlated to the ligand concentration in the initial mixture. The results pave the way towards the development of a programmable synthetic approach, &#160;enabling an accurate design of the engineered UAuNPs or smart hybrid nano&#8208;systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with 4&#8208;c sql Topology for Enhanced Fluorescence Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively investigated due to their unique structure, porosity, and functionality. However, at the topological level, COFs remain as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) or three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures, while COFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) topology have not been systematically explored. In this work, we proposed a synthetic strategy for the construction of 1D&#8208;COFs based on non&#8208;linear edges and suitable high&#8208;symmetry vertices. Compared with their 2D&#8208;COFs counterparts, the 1D&#8208;COFs with AIEgens located at the vertex of the frame exhibited enhanced fluorescence. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the dimensional&#8208;induced rotation restriction (DIRR) effect could spontaneously introduce additional non&#8208;covalent interactions between the strip frames, which could substantially diminish non&#8208;radiative transitions. This work also provides protocols for the design of 1D&#8208;COFs and a guidance scheme for the synthesis of emitting COFs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report an oxygen vacancy (Vo)&#8208;rich metallic MoO2&#8208;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin with partially occupied band, which exhibits super CO2 (even directly from the air) photoreduction performance under UV, visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light illumination. The Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8208;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin displays a CH4 evolution rate of 12.2 and 5.8 &#956;mol gcatalyst&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under full spectrum and NIR light illumination in concentrated CO2, which is ca. 7&#8208; and 10&#8208;fold higher than the Vo&#8208;poor MoO2&#8208;x, respectively. More interestingly, the as&#8208;developed Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8208;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin can even reduce CO2 directly from the air with a CO evolution rate of 6.5 &#956;mol gcatalyst&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under NIR light illumination. Experiments together with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy in MoO2&#8208;x can facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation to generate *COOH as well as the subsequent protonation of *CO towards the formation of CH4 because of the formation of a highly stable Mo&#8211;C&#8211;O&#8211;Mo intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Superior Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation with Dimethyl Ether</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are demonstrated to be readily activated by treatment with the low surface tension, low boiling point solvent dimethyl ether (DME). The mildness of the method enables access to high surface areas by avoiding structural changes in the framework that often plague thermal activation methods. A distinction from previous methods is that DME activation succeeds for materials with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) and non&#8208;CUS MOFs as well. DME displaces solvent molecules occupying the pores of the MOF as well as those coordinated to metal centers; reducing evacuation temperature by using a coordinating, yet highly volatile guest enables low temperature activation with structural retention as demonstrated by surface area measurements that match or exceed existing activation protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Activation Enabled by a Single, Vinylogous Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of highly activated donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes bearing only a single, vinylogous acceptor is presented. These strained moieties readily undergo cycloadditions with aldehydes, ketones, thioketones, nitriles, naphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols and various other substrates to yield the corresponding carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Diastereocontrol can be achieved through the choice of catalyst (Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acid). The formation of tetrahydrofurans was shown to be highly enantiospecific when chiral cyclopropanes are employed. A series of mechanistic and kinetic experiments was conducted to elucidate a plausible catalytic cycle and to rationalize the stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral perhydroindoles are found in a number of natural products and biologically active compounds. Therefore, the development of new asymmetric methodology for rapid access to this core is of high importance. Herein, we reported a highly regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selective palladium/PC&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8208;Trost reactions of readily available amino tethered 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes with aryl and alkenyl halides, delivering various functionalized chiral hexahydroindoles in good yields with high enantioselectivity. The application of this reaction to the concise synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Lycorane was demonstrated. DFT computation results indicate that the difference in &#916;Edis of two migration insertion transition states determines the enantioselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangements of Naphthyl 1&#8208;Propargyl Ethers: para&#8208;Propargylation and Catalytic Asymmetric Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  para  &#8208;Claisen rearrangement of aryl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers involves two&#8208;step [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements and dearomatization process, which has high activation barriers and is of challenge. Here we discovered thermal  para  &#8208;Claisen rearrangement of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers, and it enabled the formation of formal  para  &#8208;C&#8208;H propargylation products upon rearomatization. Chirality transfer occurred if optically active propargyl ethers were employed, leading to the construction of aryl/propargyl&#8208;containing stereogenic centers. Moreover, catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers with different substitution at  para  &#8208;position gave access to benzocyclohexenones bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The reaction was accelerate&#160;by a chiral&#160;  N,N&#8242;  &#8208;dioxide/Co(OTf)  2  complex catalyst to achieve high yields (up to 98%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 93%  ee  ).

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Ketonization of Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acids are attractive building blocks for synthetic chemistry because they are chemically stable, abundant, and commercially available with substantial structural diversity. The process of combining two carboxylic acids to furnish a ketone is termed ketonization. This is a potentially valuable transformation that has been underutilized in organic synthesis due to the harsh reaction conditions generally required and the lack of selectivity obtained when coupling two distinct carboxylic acids. We report herein a metallaphotoredox strategy that selectively generates unsymmetrical ketones via cross&#8208;ketonization of two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids. Cross&#8208;selectivity is achieved by exploiting diverging reactivity of differentially substituted acids towards critical one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron processes in the proposed coupling mechanism. This method is broadly applicable to a variety of functionalized carboxylic acids. It can also be applied to acids of similar steric profile by exploiting differences in their relative rates of decarboxylation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered&#160;Synthetic Nanopore for Controlling Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling biological molecular processes with light is of high interest in biological research and biomedicine, as light allows precise and selective activation in a non&#8208;invasive and non&#8208;toxic manner. A molecular process benefitting from light control is the transport of cargo across biological membranes, which is conventionally achieved by membrane&#8208;puncturing barrel&#8208;shaped nanopores. Yet, there is considerable interest to construct more complex gated pores. Here, we pioneer a synthetic light&#8208;gated nanostructure which controls transport across membranes via a controllable lid. The light&#8208;triggered nanopore is self&#8208;assembled from six pore DNA strands and a lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene molecules. Exposure to light opens the pore to allow small&#8208;molecule transport across membranes. Our light&#8208;triggered pore advances biomimetic chemistry and DNA nanotechnology and may be used in biotechnology, biosensing, targeted drug release, or synthetic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Maximum Impact of Ionic Strength on Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Rates Induced by a Zeolite Microporous Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intracrystalline ionic environment in microporous zeolite can remarkably modify the excess chemical potential of adsorbed reactants and transition states, thereby influencing the catalytic turnover rates. However, a limit of the rate enhancement for aqueous&#8208;phase dehydration of alcohols appears to exist for zeolites with high ionic strength. The origin of such limitation has been hypothesized to be caused by the spatial constraints in the pores via, e.g., size exclusion effects. It is demonstrated here that the increase in turnover rate as well as the formation of a maximum and the rate drop are intrinsic consequences of the increasingly dense ionic environment in zeolite. The molecularly sized confines of zeolite create a unique ionic environment that monotonically favors the formation of alcohol&#8208;hydronium ion complexes in the micropores. The zeolite microporous environment determines the kinetics of catalytic steps and tailors the impact of ionic strength on catalytic rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structures of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Coordination Environment Engineering for Boosting CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have emerged as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction owing to the synergistic effect between the binary metal sites. However, rationally modulating the electronic structure of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the electronic structure modulation of three Ni2 DACs (namely, Ni2&#8208;N7, Ni2&#8208;N5C2 and Ni2&#8208;N3C4) by the regulation of the coordination environments around the dual&#8208;atom Ni2 centres. As a result, Ni2&#8208;N3C4 exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, not only better than the corresponding single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst (Ni&#8208;N2C2), but also higher than Ni2&#8208;N7 and Ni2&#8208;N5C2 DACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni2&#8208;N3C4 for CO2 reduction could be attributed to the electronic structure modulation to the Ni centre and the resulted proper binding energies to COOH* and CO* intermediates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative was prepared from C60 in 7 steps and 5.5% yield through the peroxide&#8208;mediate pathway. There are four carbonyl groups, an ether oxygen and a quinoxaline moiety on the rim of the orifice. Chloride anion could be inserted into its cavity by heating with hydrochloric acid at 60 oC for 4 h. Encapsulation of fluoride, bromide and iodide anions were also achieved at slightly more enforcing conditions, 90 oC and around 14 h. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the sodium salt of the chloride and the bromide encapsulated derivatives were obtained, which showed the halide anion in the center of the cavity and two sodium cations connecting two cages through coordinating to the oxygen atoms on the rim of the orifice. The halide encapsulation ratio is quantitative in the isolated products.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first method for highly enantioselective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed Heyns rearrangements. These reactions, catalyzed by a chiral spiro phosphoric acid, afforded synthetically valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoketones which cannot be obtained by means of previously reported Heyns rearrangement methods. This method features low catalyst loadings, high yields and high enantioselectivities, making these reactions highly practical. We used the method to efficiently synthesize various chiral amines, including some biologically active molecules. We experimentally proved that these acid&#8208;catalyzed Heyns rearrangements proceeded via a proton&#8208;transfer process involving an enol intermediate and the stereocontrol was realized during the proton&#8208;transfer step.</dc:description>

         <title>Amyloid Against Amyloid: Dimeric Amyloid Fragment Ameliorates Cognitive Impairments by Direct Clearance of Oligomers and Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in the form of neurotoxic aggregates is regarded as the main pathological initiator and key therapeutic target of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. However, anti&#8208;A&#946; drug development has been impeded by the lack of a target needed for structure&#8208;based drug design and low permeability of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). An attractive therapeutic strategy is the development of amyloid&#8208;based anti&#8208;A&#946; peptidomimetics that exploits the self&#8208;assembling nature of A&#946; and penetrates the BBB. Herein, we designed a dimeric peptide drug candidate based on the N&#8208;terminal fragment of A&#946;, DAB, found to cross the BBB and solubilize A&#946; oligomers and fibrils. Administration of DAB reduced amyloid burden in 5XFAD mice, and downregulated neuroinflammation and prevented memory impairment in the Y&#8208;maze test. Peptide mapping assays and molecular docking studies were utilized to elucidate DAB&#8208;A&#946; interaction. To further understand the active regions of DAB, we assessed the dissociative activity of DAB with sequence modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Organogold(III) Complexes Display Conditional Photoactivities: Evolving From Photodynamic into Photoactivated Chemotherapy in Response to O2 Consumption for Robust Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;reactivity for robust tumor therapy: A PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photo&#8208;reactivity with response to oxygen&#8208;consumption was found in cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes, leading to potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, strong anti&#8208;angiogenesis in zebrafish, and efficient suppression of mouse tumor xenografts.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a spatiotemporally controllable, powerful approach in combating cancers but suffers from low activity under hypoxia, whereas photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) operates in an O2&#8208;independent manner but compromises the ability to harness O2 for potent photosensitization. Herein we report that cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes display a PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photoactivity for efficient cancer treatment. On the one hand, the gold(III) complexes can act as dual photosensitizers and substrates, leading to conditional PDT activity in oxygenated condition that progresses to highly efficient PACT (&#981; up to 0.63) when O2 is depleted in solution and under cellular environment. On the other hand, the conditional PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT reactivity can be triggered by external photosensitizers in a similar manner in vitro and in vivo, giving additional tumor&#8208;selectivity and/or deep tissue penetration by red&#8208;light irradiation that leads to robust anticancer efficacy.

         <title>Realizing zT&gt;2 in Environment&#8208;Friendly Monoclinic Cu2S&#8212;Tetragonal Cu1.96S Nano&#8208;Phase Junctions for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;controlled phase junction nanocomposites are prepared by a novel surface ligand (decanethiol)&#8208;directed strategy. The conductivity is increased by modulation doping, and the phase boundary enhances phonon scattering, which helps to reduce lattice thermal conductivity. The combined effects yield a record&#8208;high zT=2.1 in metal sulfide thermoelectric materials.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites, made of nanograins with the same composition but different phases, offer a platform to optimize the physiochemical performance of materials. Herein, we demonstrate a straightforward strategy to synthesize Cu2&#8722;xS phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites by retaining surface 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands, in contrast to the traditional method that strips the ligands. As a result, phase junctions between a conventional monoclinic (m) phase and an unconventional metastable tetragonal (t) phase are obtained. The significantly improved power factor is obtained due to the doping of the t&#8208;phase. The phase&#8208;junction interfaces reduce thermal conductivity. Finally, surface regulation of phase junctions pushes the peak zT to 2.1 at 932&#8197;K, being the highest reported for environment&#8208;friendly metal sulfides. This work provides a paradigm to optimize thermoelectric performance by controlling phase junctions through surface&#8208;ligand tuning.

         <title>Co&#8208;compartmentalization of Enzymes and Cofactors within Pickering Emulsion Droplets for Continuous&#8208;Flow Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow biocatalytic system based on the co&#8208;compartmentalization of enzymes and cofactors within Pickering emulsion droplets has been developed. As exemplified by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed ketone enantioselective reduction and enantioselective transamination, this system features long&#8208;term operational stability, excellent catalytic efficiency and no need for exogenous cofactors.

Co&#8208;immobilization of enzymes and cofactors in a manner suitable for use in continuous flow catalysis remains a great challenge because of the difficulty in ensuring the free accessibility of immobilized enzymes and cofactors. Herein, we present a continuous flow catalysis system based on co&#8208;compartmentalization of enzymes and cofactors within Pickering emulsion droplets, enabling regeneration of cofactors within the droplets. As exemplified by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed ketone enantioselective reduction and enantioselective transamination, our systems exhibit long&#8208;term stability (300&#8211;400&#8197;h), outstanding total turnover number (TTN, 59204&#8197;mol mol&#8722;1) and several&#8208;fold enhancement in the enzyme catalytic efficiency (CEe) in comparison to conventional biphasic reactions. As well as giving insight into the co&#8208;compartmentalization effects, our system will provide the opportunity to significantly advance continuous&#8208;flow biocatalysis towards the level of practical applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Allylic C&#8722;H Amination of Vinylsilanes and Vinylboronates using Silicon or Boron as a Regioselectivity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination protocol allows simple vinylsilanes and vinylboronates to be selectively functionalized without competitive consumption of the reactive vinylmetalloid core structure, preserving its reactivity for future transformations such as cross&#8208;coupling or addition reactions. The silicon/boron group directs the regioselectivity of amination to the distal side of the C=C bond, allowing access to a complementary substitution pattern.







Abstract
Vinylsilanes and vinylboronates are common building blocks for organic synthesis, but direct functionalization of these species without the participation of either the C=C or C&#8722;Si/B bonds is rare. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination reaction of these vinylmetalloid species that installs a new C&#8722;N bond without competing transmetallation or alkene addition. In this transformation, the silicon or boron substituent inverts the usual regioselectivity, directing amination to the site distal to that group. Subsequent cross&#8208;coupling or demetallation allows access to complementary regioisomeric products. Density Functional Theory computations revealed that the observed regioselectivity is due to a subtle combination of electronic and counterintuitive steric factors that favor initial attack of selenium at the silicon&#8208;bearing carbon atom.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes with Amino&#8208;Functionalized Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts serve as a unique platform for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective formal [2+2] cycloaddition of a wide range of allenes with amino&#8208;functionalized alkenes via allene C(sp2)&#8722;H activation, affording a new family of cyclobutane and cyclobutene derivatives which were difficult to access previously.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes with alkenes is of much interest and importance as a straightforward route for the construction of four&#8208;membered carbocycles but has remained much underexplored to date. Herein we report for the first time the intermolecular regio&#8208; and diastereoselective formal [2+2] cycloaddition of a wide range of allenes with amino&#8208;functionalized alkenes by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts. The reaction proceeded through an allene C(sp2)&#8722;H activation mechanism initiated by the site&#8208;selective deprotonation of the allene unit by a rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl species followed by alkene insertion into the resulting metal&#8208;allenyl bond and the subsequent intramolecular cycloaddition to an allene C=C bond. This protocol offers a unique route for the synthesis of a new family of cyclobutane and cyclobutene derivatives which were difficult to access previously.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenation of Hexafluoroacetone Hydrate Enables Hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported, wherein the intrinsic aldehyde/ketone&#8208;gem&#8208;diol equilibrium and photocatalytic phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation play key roles. A range of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are compatible in this transformation, thus leading to structurally varied bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
An unprecedented photoredox&#8208;catalyzed phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation of hexafluoroacetone hydrate was established to accomplish the hydroxylpolyfluoroalkylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. A range of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols were facilely accessed by using readily available hexafluoroacetone hydrate, instead of toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. A range of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are tolerated, giving the corresponding hydro&#8208;hydroxylpolyfluoroalkylated products in moderate to high yields. Remarkable features of this synthetic strategy include operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, excellent regioselectivity, and broad functional group tolerance. The success of this strategy relies on the delicate utilization of aldehyde/ketone&#8208;gem&#8208;diol intrinsic equilibrium, which offers an innovated open&#8208;shell pathway for the assembly of synthetically challenging polyfluoroalkylated scaffolds.

         <title>Modulating the Rise and Decay Dynamics of Upconversion Luminescence through Controlling Excitations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to the extensively investigated steady&#8208;state upconversion luminescence (UCL), systematic studies on temporal UCL are carried out, which have enabled wide modulation of the rise and decay dynamics of the UCL, and consequently a record adjustment of 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, as well as reversibly definable Er3+ emission color by simply tuning the pulse width of the excitation laser.







Abstract
Different from organic dye/quantum dot possessing one luminescent center, upconversion luminescence (UCL) is actually a statistic of temporal behaviors of countless individual activators. Our experimental results have shown that the rise and decay dynamics of UCL is directly associated with the relative contribution of sensitizer&#8208;to&#8208;activator energy transfer and energy migration among sensitizers, which can be physically modulated by simply tuning the excitation laser. Therefore, dynamic UCL with record&#8208;wide 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, and reversibly definable emission color is easily realized by just modulating the excitation laser. Moreover, this generally applicable strategy only requires a simplest&#8208;possible UCL system whereas prevalent material engineering such as complicated composition design, sophisticated core&#8211;shell construction, or tedious chemical synthesis, is no longer needed.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution by Side&#8208;Group Engineered Benzodiimidazole Oligomers with Strong Built&#8208;in Electric Fields and Short&#8208;Range Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxyl&#8208;rich benzodiimidazole oligomers (BDO&#8208;HC) are obtained through a side&#8208;group assisted self&#8208;assembly. The carboxyl&#8208;based strong built&#8208;in electric field promotes charge separation, and the nano&#8208;range crystals provide short channels for charge transfer. The photocatalyst is capable of efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution.







Abstract
The insufficient charge separation and sluggish exciton transport severely limit the utilization of polymeric photocatalysts. To resolve the above issues, we incorporate bountiful carboxyl substituents within a novel benzodiimidazole oligomer and assemble it into a crystalline semiconductor. The photocatalyst is polar, hydrophilic, short&#8208;range crystalline, and capable of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The introduction of carboxyl side&#8208;groups adds asymmetry to the local structure and increases the built&#8208;in electric field. Further, accelerated carrier transfer is enabled via the short&#8208;range crystallinity. The superior hydrogen and oxygen production rates of 18.63 and 2.87&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 represent one of the best performances ever reported among dual&#8208;functional polymeric photocatalysts. Our work initiates studies on high&#8208;performance oligomer photocatalysts, opening a new frontier to produce solar fuel.

         <title>On&#8208;Site Non&#8208;enzymatic Orthogonal Activation of a Catalytic DNA Circuit for Self&#8208;Reinforced In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;enzymatically and orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit was prepared for on&#8208;site and efficient in vivo microRNA (miRNA) imaging without off&#8208;site signal leakage. The CCD circuit integrates the cell&#8208;specific endogenous stimulation of the auxiliary catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) with the orthogonal activation of the main entropy&#8208;driven DNA reaction (EDR) for sensitive target detection.







Abstract
The wide extracellular&#8208;intracellular distribution of microRNA requires the on&#8208;site, robust and efficient activation of catalytic DNA circuits inside live cells. Herein, we develop an efficient non&#8208;enzymatic circuitry activation strategy to realize the orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit for achieving high&#8208;fidelity in vivo microRNA imaging through multiply guaranteed molecular recognition and progressively accelerated signal amplification. For predictable on&#8208;site activation and useful catalytic efficiency, the dominating circuitry fuel strand was initially split into inactive fuel subunits that were grafted into an auxiliary catalytic circuit. There, the in&#8208;cell&#8208;specific mRNA triggered the orthogonal amplification of the active fuel strands for sensitive target detection through the chief entropy&#8208;driven catalytic DNA circuit. We believe that the on&#8208;site orthogonal circuitry activation method can contribute to clinical diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Ag22 Nanoclusters with Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Protected by Ag/Cyanurate/Phosphine Metallamacrocyclic Monolayers through In&#8208;Situ Ligand Transesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isostructural Ag22 nanoclusters protected by a metallamacrocyclic monolayer were synthesized in high yields by in&#8208;situ ligand formation strategy. The high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity triazine&#8208;based cyanurate ligands endow the clusters with unique core&#8208;shell interfacial bonding structure and donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structure, resulting in the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic.







Abstract
The composition of protection monolayer exerts great influence on the molecular and electronic structures of atomically precise monolayer protected metal nanoclusters. Four isostructural Ag/cyanurate/phosphine metallamacrocyclic monolayer protected Ag22 nanoclusters are synthesized by kinetically controlled in&#8208;situ ligand formation&#8208;driven strategy. These eight&#8208;electron superatomic silver nanoclusters feature an unprecedented interfacial bonding structure with diverse E&#8208;Ag (E=O/N/P/Ag) interactions between the Ag13 core and metallamacrocyclic monolayer, and displays thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), benefiting from their distinct donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structures. This work not only unmasks a new core&#8208;shell interface involving cyanurate ligand but also underlines the significance of high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity N&#8208;heterocyclic ligand in synthesizing TADF metal nanoclusters. This is the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with TADF characteristic.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Assisted Charge Transport through Positively Charged Dimer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimer single&#8208;molecule junction with positively charged units is constructed through host&#8211;guest interaction using graphene&#8208;based static molecular junctions. A transition mechanism from temperature&#8208;independent coherent tunneling to temperature&#8208;dependent incoherent transport is observed, which is caused by thermally&#8208;induced specific molecular vibration modes. The introduction of positive charge can improve the incoherent transport process.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport plays a vital role in the fields of electronics, as well as biochemical systems. Here, we design supramolecular dimer junctions and investigate the effects of charge state and energy level alignment on charge transport under nanoconfinement. Incoherent tunneling caused by thermally&#8208;induced vibrations is enhanced in positively charged systems. The transition between coherent and incoherent tunneling is associated with specific molecular vibration modes. Positively charged systems with smaller torsional barriers and vibrational frequencies result in lower transition temperatures. Multiple thermal effects have a great impact on the conductance in the off&#8208;resonant tunneling, while thermally&#8208;induced vibron&#8208;assisted tunneling contributes more to the transport in the resonant tunneling. These investigations offer a deep mechanism understanding of intermolecular charge transport and facilitate the development of practical functional molecular devices.

         <title>Exploring the Gas&#8208;Phase Formation and Chemical Reactivity of Highly Reduced M8L6 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination cages containing porphyrin subunits are reduced up to fourteen times in the gas phase. While the presence or absence of Nickel(II) coordinated in the porphyrin binding site does not affect the rate of reduction, the reactivity of the reduced species toward molecular O2 is significantly enhanced in the former case. Additionally, the presence of a C60 fullerene guest within the nickelated cage reduces its reactivity.







Abstract
Coordination cages with well&#8208;defined cavities show great promise in the field of catalysis on account of their unique combination of molecular confinement effects and transition&#8208;metal redox chemistry. Here, three coordination cages are reduced from their native 16+ oxidation state to the 2+ state in the gas phase without observable structural degradation. Using this method, the reaction rate constants for each reduction step were determined, with no noticeable differences arising following either the incorporation of a C60&#8208;fullerene guest or alteration of the cage chemical structure. The reactivity of highly reduced cage species toward molecular oxygen is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; after a threshold number of reduction steps, which is influenced by guest molecules and the structure of cage components. These new experimental approaches provide a unique window to explore the chemistry of highly&#8208;reduced cage species that can be modulated by altering their structures and encapsulated guest species.

         <title>Decarboxylative Selective Phosphorylation of Aliphatic Acids: A Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208; and Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Avenue to Dialkyl and Trialkyl Phosphine Oxides from White Phosphorus</title>

         <dc:description>
Functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters to synthesize dialkylphosphines and trialkylphosphines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions is presented. The oxidation products can be isolated in high yield via the air oxidation of alkylated phosphines.







Abstract
Developing practical and mild strategies for the direct functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) without chlorination is an appealing but formidable challenge. To this end, we report a breakthrough in the preparation of structurally diverse dialkylphosphines and trialkylphosphines that rely on the successive generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters and the controllable alkylation of the P4 molecule under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. To facilitate separation and prevent product losses during purification, the corresponding oxidation products dialkylphosphine oxides (DAPOs) and trialkylphosphine oxides (TAPOs) were isolated. This photoinduced phosphorylation reaction features one&#8208;pot operation, high product selectivity, and tolerates a broad range of alkyl NHPI esters, including derivatives of complex natural products and pharmaceuticals. Further diversified transformation of DAPOs to construct P&#8722;F, P&#8722;C, P&#8722;N, and P&#8722;O bonds was also demonstrated.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Chiral Carbene&#8208;CuI&#8208;Amide Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been constructed to exhibit aggregation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence with large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027. Inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent TADF properties strongly associated with ligand&#8208;ligand rotation of enantiomer molecules were also demonstrated.







Abstract
The field of luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes and chiroptical&#8208;active materials has been blossoming in recent years, although chiroptical&#8208;active CMA complexes have not been reported so far. For the first time, a pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been developed by using chiral phenyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes as acceptor ligands in the CMA motif. The CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027, the first reported for CMA complexes. This success originates from the limited ligand&#8208;ligand rotation freedom and asymmetrical packing pattern (helical structure) of the CMA enantiomers in the crystals. Moreover, these CuI enantiomers displayed inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. These findings bring new insights into the optical properties of chiral CMA complexes from the perspective of aggregation states.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Structural Motif in Lanthipeptide Synthetases for Substrate Binding and Interdomain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique structural motif for leader binding and interdomain interactions was identified in the crystal structure of the kinase domain of class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC responsible for the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. This motif consists of two N&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets, a central &#945;&#8208;helix, and three C&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets.







Abstract
Class III lanthipeptide synthetases catalyze the formation of lanthionine/methyllanthionine and labionin crosslinks. We present here the 2.40&#8197;&#197; resolution structure of the kinase domain of a class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC from the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. A unique structural subunit for leader binding, named leader recognition domain (LRD), was identified. The LRD of CurKC is responsible for the recognition of the leader peptide and for mediating interactions between the lyase and kinase domains. LRDs are highly conserved among the kinase domains of class III and class IV lanthipeptide synthetases. The discovery of LRDs provides insight into the substrate recognition and domain organization in multidomain lanthipeptide synthetases.

         <title>Enantiomeric NIR&#8208;II Emitting Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Doped Ag2Se Nanoparticles with Differentiated In Vivo Imaging Efficiencies</title>

Chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs by introducing RuCl[(p&#8208;cymene(BINAP)]Cl as ligands were synthesized. Nd3+, Yb3+ and Er3+ as sensitizers case a fluorescence red&#8208;shift to 1550&#8197;nm with an intensity increased by 145.7&#8208;fold compared with Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs. The fluorescence imaging efficiency of R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs was 2&#8208;fold higher than that of S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs.







Abstract
Here, chiral second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emitting rare&#8208;earth doped silver selenide nanoparticles (R&#8208; or S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs) were fabricated, exhibiting circular dichroism peak at 850&#8197;nm and fluorescence peak at 1550&#8197;nm, with 145.7&#8208;fold enhanced intensity compared to the reported Ag2Se NPs. Compared with S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs, imaging efficiency of R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs in living cells was significantly improved due to a higher cellular uptake rate and 927.7&#8208;fold higher affinity. Furthermore, R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs reached at the tumor 2&#8208;fold faster than S type of NPs in vivo. We discover that chirality leads to differences in the affinity between chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) onto the surface of murine mammary carcinoma cell to cause different in vivo imaging efficiency. These results reveal that chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs have high photoluminescence intensity and high in vivo imaging efficiency reflecting wide applications in biomedical diagnosis.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs by introducing RuCl[(p-cymene(BINAP)]Cl as ligands were synthesized. Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; as sensitizers case a fluorescence red-shift to 1550&#8197;nm with an intensity increased by 145.7-fold compared with Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs. The fluorescence imaging efficiency of R-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs was 2-fold higher than that of S-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, chiral second near-infrared (NIR-II) emitting rare-earth doped silver selenide nanoparticles (R- or S-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs) were fabricated, exhibiting circular dichroism peak at 850&#8197;nm and fluorescence peak at 1550&#8197;nm, with 145.7-fold enhanced intensity compared to the reported Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se NPs. Compared with S-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs, imaging efficiency of R-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs in living cells was significantly improved due to a higher cellular uptake rate and 927.7-fold higher affinity. Furthermore, R-Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs reached at the tumor 2-fold faster than S type of NPs in vivo. We discover that chirality leads to differences in the affinity between chiral Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) onto the surface of murine mammary carcinoma cell to cause different in vivo imaging efficiency. These results reveal that chiral Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs have high photoluminescence intensity and high in vivo imaging efficiency reflecting wide applications in biomedical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pt Atoms/Clusters on Ni&#8208;phytate&#8208;sensitized Carbon Nitride for Enhanced NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven Overall Water Splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm</title>

A NIR light&#8208;driven photocatalyst for overall water splitting was constructed by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven overall water splitting beyond 800&#8197;nm remains a high&#8208;priority target yet great challenge. Here we report that efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons in a photosensitized system prepared by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The optimal catalyst presents simultaneous hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution with an H2 evolution amount of 1.4&#8197;&#956;mol at &#955;&gt;800&#8197;nm for 24&#8197;hours, which its activity was approximately 140&#8197;times higher than that of a system without Pt&#8208;SAC modification (PA&#8208;Ni1.1@PCN). This work represents the first NIR&#8208;light responsive photosensitized system for overall water splitting, and may open an avenue for precisely manipulating cocatalyst positions at the atomic level to improve NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting via photosensitization.

         <title>Integrating a Far&#8208;Red Fluorescent Probe with a Microfluidic Platform for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Erythrocyte Membrane Dynamics
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red fluorescent probe with blinking and lasting emission is developed to meet the contradictory requirements of super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule tracking. A microfluidic device is fabricated to trap red blood cells (RBCs) and to enable the manipulation of the microenvironment. The integration of the probe and device has uncovered nanoscale dynamics of living RBC membranes, providing a means to advance diagnostics to the molecular level.







Abstract
Living erythrocyte (red blood cell, RBC) membranes present rich ultrastructural and dynamic details, which require synchronous super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule tracking to be revealed. Yet, it poses a serious challenge to achieve these dual functions in a single probe, due to the rigid and conflicting photophysical demands of the different techniques. Herein, we rationally developed a far&#8208;red boron dipyrromethene membrane probe with blinking capability and persistent single&#8208;molecule emission, and constructed a microfluidic platform for noninvasive trapping and long&#8208;term imaging of RBCs. By combining them, multi&#8208;dimensional super&#8208;resolution reconstructions and single&#8208;molecule tracking were achieved at the molecular scale on living human RBC membranes in a high&#8208;throughput manner. Our integrated system defines a quantitative method for analyzing RBC membranes under physiological and pathological conditions, improving precision and revealing new perspectives for future disease diagnostics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography: A New Paradigm for Versatility in Simultaneous Multicomponent Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid separation technique, referred to as Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), enabling simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range is introduced. DGUC lays the foundation for the next generation of hybrid chromatographic techniques with the deployment of universal elution profiles obtained via multi&#8208;eluent blending beyond traditional separation modes.







Abstract
Generality in analytical chemistry can be manifested in impactful platforms that can streamline modern organic synthesis and biopharmaceutical processes. We herein introduce a hybrid separation technique named Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), which is built upon an automated dynamic modulation of CO2, organic modifier, and water blends with various buffers. This concept enables simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range in single experimental runs. After a careful investigation of its fundamental aspects, a DGUC&#8208;DAD&#8208;MS screening workflow that combines multiple orthogonal column and mobile phase choices across a far&#8208;reaching universal elution profile is also reported. The power of this framework is demonstrated with new analytical applications guiding academic and industrial laboratories in the development of new (bio)pharmaceutical targets (e.g. synthetic intermediates, nucleosides, cyclic and linear peptides, proteins, antibody drug conjugates).

         <title>Linker Redox Mediated Control of Morphology and Properties in Semiconducting Iron&#8208;Semiquinoid Coordination Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D semiconducting coordination polymer Fe5(C6O6)3 is reported with high conductivity, broad electronic transitions and interesting thermoelectric/magnetic properties. The unique structure and properties of this material illustrate that controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting metal&#8208;organic materials can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies, properties, and functionalities.







Abstract
The emergence of conductive 2D and less commonly 3D coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promises novel applications in many fields. However, the synthetic parameters for these electronically complex materials are not thoroughly understood. Here we report a new 3D semiconducting CP Fe5(C6O6)3, which is a fusion of 2D Fe&#8208;semiquinoid materials and 3D cubic Fex(C6O6)y materials, by using a different initial redox&#8208;state of the C6O6 linker. The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (S2&#963;=7.0&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature. This material illustrates how controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting CPs/MOFs can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies and properties in contrast to more commonly encountered post&#8208;synthetic modifications.

         <title>Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Complexes Empowered by London Dispersion: The C&#8722;H Functionalization Nexus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The encounter of a donor/acceptor diazo derivative with a hydrocarbon inside the chiral binding pocket crafted by London dispersion about a heterobimetallic [BiRh] paddlewheel complex entails highly effective asymmetric C&#8722;H insertion; the resulting products formally correspond to the outcome of classical ester alkylation, allylation, benzylation, or aldol reactions.







Abstract
Heterobimetallic [BiRh] tetracarboxylate catalysts endowed with 1,3&#8208;disilylated phenylglycine paddlewheels benefit from interligand London dispersion. They were originally designed for asymmetric cyclopropanation but are now shown to perform very well in asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions too. Because of the confined ligand sphere about the derived donor/acceptor carbenes, insertions into unhindered methyl groups are kinetically favored, although methylene units also react with excellent levels of asymmetric induction; even gaseous ethane is a suitable substrate. Moreover, many functional groups in both partners are tolerated. The resulting products are synthetically equivalent to the outcome of traditional asymmetric ester alkylation, allylation, benzylation, propargylation and aldol reactions and therefore constitute a valuable nexus to more conventional chemical logic.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Enhanced Oncolytic Virus&#8208;Like Nanoparticle for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy is proposed to enhance T cell&#8208;mediated tumor immunotherapy by synthesizing an ion&#8208;enhanced nanoplatform PolyIC@ZIF&#8208;8. This nanoplatform not only mimics an oncolytic virus&#8208;like function by inducing cell apoptosis to recruit T cells in a tumor antigen&#8208;dependent manner but also releases Zn2+ to enhance T cell recruitment and activation in a tumor antigen&#8208;independent manner.







Abstract
T lymphocytes (T cells) are essential for tumor immunotherapy. However, the insufficient number of activated T cells greatly limits the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we proposed an oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy to enhance T cell recruitment and activation for tumor treatment. We constructed an oncolytic virus&#8208;like nanoplatform (PolyIC@ZIF&#8208;8) that was degraded in the acidic tumor environment to release PolyIC and Zn2+. The released PolyIC exhibited an oncolytic virus&#8208;like function that induced tumor cell apoptosis and promoted T cell recruitment and activation through a tumor antigen&#8208;dependent manner. More importantly, the released Zn2+ not only enhanced T cell recruitment by inducing CXCL9/10/11 expression but also promoted T cell activation to increase interferon&#8208;&#947; (INF&#8208;&#947;) expression by inducing the phosphorylation of ZAP&#8208;70 via a tumor antigen&#8208;independent manner. This Zn2+&#8208;enhanced oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy provides a new approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Sactipeptide Engineering by Probing the Substrate Tolerance of a Thioether&#8208;Bond&#8208;Forming Sactisynthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sactipeptides are a class of microbial peptides possessing thioether crosslinks. We demonstrate sactipeptide engineering without compromising their post&#8208;translational modification introduced by sactisynthases. A variety of natural and hybrid sactipeptide constructs were generated and analyzed for the presence of thioether crosslinks, demonstrating the possibility to design variants with novel functionalities.







Abstract
Sactipeptides are ribosomally synthesized peptides containing a unique sulfur to &#945;&#8208;carbon crosslink. Catalyzed by sactisynthases, this thioether pattern endows sactipeptides with enhanced structural, thermal, and proteolytic stability, which makes them attractive scaffolds for the development of novel biotherapeutics. Herein, we report the in&#8208;depth study on the substrate tolerance of the sactisynthase AlbA to catalyze the formation of thioether bridges in sactipeptides. We identified a possible modification site within the sactipeptide subtilosin A allowing for peptide engineering without compromising formation of thioether bridges. A panel of natural and hybrid sactipeptides was produced to study the AlbA&#8208;mediated formation of thioether bridges, which were identified mass&#8208;spectrometrically. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we re&#8208;engineered subtilosin A to a thioether&#8208;bridged, specific streptavidin targeting peptide, opening the door for the functional engineering of sactipeptides.

         <title>Dearomative (3+2) Cycloadditions between Indoles and Vinyldiazo Species Enabled by a Red&#8208;Shifted Chromium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst based on Earth&#8208;abundant chromium is described. The catalyst enables a dearomative (3+2) cycloaddition between indoles and vinyldiazo reagents. Densely functionalized indoline compounds are readily accessed in high yields and exclusive regioselectivity.







Abstract
A direct dearomative photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition between indoles and vinyldiazo reagents is described. The transformation is enabled by the development of a novel oxidizing CrIII photocatalyst, its specific reactivity attributed to increased absorptive properties over earlier Cr analogs and greater stability than Ru counterparts. A variety of fused indoline compounds are synthesized using this method, including densely functionalized ring systems that are feasible due to base&#8208;free conditions. Experimental insights corroborate a cycloaddition initiated by nucleophilic attack at C3 of the indole radical cation by the vinyldiazo species.

         <title>Diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Sites for Complete N&#8801;N Bond Formation in Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction strategy is taken to synthesize diatomic Pd&#8722;Cu catalysts on 2D phosphorene. Owing to the strength of the unique synergistic effect of PdCuP4 coordination, the adsorption of NO3&#8722;, the transfer of intermediates, and the formation of N&#8801;N bond are all enhanced, leading to a high NO3&#8722; removal rate and N2 selectivity.







Abstract
The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high&#8208;density PdCu dual&#8208;atom to form a unique PdCuP4 coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3&#8201;% NO3&#8722; removal rate and 95.2&#8201;% N2 selectivity. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual&#8208;atom form covalent&#8208;like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual&#8208;atom promotes the breaking of N&#8722;O bond, and the short bond length of &#8776;3&#8197;&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO2&#8722;, and eventually the two Pd&#8722;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N2.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the transfer of intermediates, and the formation of N&#8801;N bond are all enhanced, leading to a high NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; removal rate and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high-performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high-density PdCu dual-atom to form a unique PdCuP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3&#8201;% NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; removal rate and 95.2&#8201;% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual-atom form covalent-like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual-atom promotes the breaking of N&#8722;O bond, and the short bond length of &#8776;3&#8197;&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and eventually the two Pd&#8722;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Origin of Favorable Substituent Effects in Excellent Cu Cyclam Based HNO Sensors</title>

         <dc:description>
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties and Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A computational study reproduced their various experimental reactivities and revealed subtle and sometimes unexpected interwoven effects of steric and electronic factors, which offer the first mechanistic understanding of substituent effects for excellent HNO sensors to facilitate future development.







Abstract
HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties. Metal complexes and derivatives are widely used to make excellent HNO sensors. However, their favorable mechanistic origins are largely unknown. Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A quantum chemical study of Cu cyclams with various substitutions was performed, which reproduced diverse experimental reactivities. Structural, electronic, and energetic profiles along reaction pathways show the importance of HNO binding and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism for HNO reaction. Results reveal that steric effect is primary and electronic factor is secondary (if the redox potential is sufficient), but their interwoven effects can lead to unexpected reactivity, which looks mysterious experimentally but can be explained computationally. This work suggests rational substituent design ideas and recommends a theoretical study of a new design to save time and cost due to its subtle effect.

         <title>Redesign of Rifamycin Antibiotics to Overcome ADP&#8208;Ribosylation&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first antibiotics with low nanomolar activity against the multidrug&#8208;resistant Mycobacterium abscessus are achieved by rational redesign of rifamycins. Structure&#8208;based modification on the rifamycin ansa&#8208;chain, together with microbiological, biochemical, biophysical and in vivo characterizations, provides novel candidates that are 300&#8208;fold more active than rifampicin, completely bypass the resistance, and possess promising pharmacokinetic profiles.







Abstract
Rifamycin antibiotics are a valuable class of antimicrobials for treating infections by mycobacteria and other persistent bacteria owing to their potent bactericidal activity against replicating and non&#8208;replicating pathogens. However, the clinical utility of rifamycins against Mycobacterium abscessus is seriously compromised by a novel resistance mechanism, namely, rifamycin inactivation by ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a structure&#8208;based approach, we rationally redesign rifamycins through strategic modification of the ansa&#8208;chain to block ADP&#8208;ribosylation while preserving on&#8208;target activity. Validated by a combination of biochemical, structural, and microbiological studies, the most potent analogs overcome ADP&#8208;ribosylation, restored their intrinsic low nanomolar activity and demonstrated significant in vivo antibacterial efficacy. Further optimization by tuning drug disposition properties afforded a preclinical candidate with remarkable potency and an outstanding pharmacokinetic profile.

         <title>Microbial Fermentation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Plastic Waste for the Production of Chemicals or Electricity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with Ideonella sakaiensis releases the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Here, a fermentative metabolic pathway in Ideonella sakaiensis was uncovered facilitating PET degradation while producing valuable feedstock chemicals or electricity in a microbial fuel cell with Geobacter sulfurreducens. This &#8216;plastic fermentation&#8217; process provides opportunities for future bioenergy technologies while combating plastic pollution.







Abstract
Ideonella sakaiensis (I.&#8197;sakaiensis) can grow on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the major carbon and energy source. Previous work has shown that PET conversion in the presence of oxygen released carbon dioxide and water while yielding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This study demonstrates that I.&#8197;sakaiensis is a facultative anaerobe that ferments PET to the feedstock chemicals acetate and ethanol in the absence of oxygen. In addition to PET, the pure monomer ethylene glycol (EG), the intermediate product ethanol, and the carbohydrate fermentation test substance maltose can also serve as fermenting substrates. Co&#8208;culturing of I.&#8197;sakaiensis with the electrogenic and acetate&#8208;consuming Geobacter sulfurreducens produced electricity from PET or EG. This newly identified plastic fermentation process by I.&#8197;sakaiensis provides thus a novel biosynthetic route to produce high&#8208;value chemicals or electricity from plastic waste streams.

         <title>Cascade Cyclopolymerization of 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;Nonadiyne Derivatives to Synthesize Low Band Gap Conjugated Polyacetylenes Containing a Fused Bicyclic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade cyclopolymerization is developed to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The regioselectivity is controlled by altering the structure of the catalyst, affording polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings. The resulting polymers show narrow band gaps due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.







Abstract
Cyclopolymerization is a powerful method for synthesizing polyacetylenes containing four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered rings. However, the structure of the repeat unit only consists of mono&#8208;cycloalkene due to the single cyclization of diyne monomers. Herein, we demonstrate a novel cascade cyclopolymerization to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings from triyne monomers containing bulky dendrons via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. These dendrons provided solubility and stability to the rigid bicyclic polyacetylene backbone. In addition, we controlled the regioselectivity of the catalyst approach by altering its structure and synthesized polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings with high molecular weights of up to 120&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Interestingly, the resulting polymers showed narrower band gaps (down to 1.6&#8197;eV) than polymers with mono&#8208;cycloalkene repeat units due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.

Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes has significant challenges, for example, it cannot realize the preparation of aldehydes selectively in alkaline aqueous solutions. By tuning the local microenvironment over the electrocatalyst, and thus selectively salting&#8208;out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface, the electrocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes was achieved in an efficient and green way.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehydes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to its higher reactivity than alcohol, the aldehyde is easily over&#8208;oxidized to acid in alkaline electrolytes. Herein we realize the selective electrooxidation of alcohol to aldehyde on NiO by tuning the local microenvironment to salt out the aldehyde from the reaction system. The origin of the high selectivity was found to be the inhibition of the hydration of aldehydes, which is the result of the decreased alkalinity and the increased cation and substrate concentration. This strategy could salt out the aldehyde at the gas|electrolyte interface from the electrooxidation of alcohol with 100&#8201;% selectivity and be easily extended to other selective oxidation reactions, such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxaldehyde (DFF) and amine to an imine.

         <title>Exceeding 30&#8201;% External Quantum Efficiency in Non&#8208;doped OLEDs Utilizing Solution Processable TADF Emitters with High Horizontal Dipole Orientation via Anchoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchoring strategy was firstly proposed to generate solution processable TADF emitters from isotropic orientation to horizontal one by attaching bipolar 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] subunits as anchoring groups onto TADF emitting core via flexible chains. With outstanding characteristics in pristine films, unprecedented EQEmaxs of 30.6&#8201;% and 25.6&#8201;% were achieved for solution processable non&#8208;doped OLEDs and TSF OLEDs, respectively.







Abstract
Strategies to enhance the ratio of the molecular horizontal emitting dipole orientation (&#920;&#8741;) for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have unlocked the full potential of efficiencies for the evaporated devices, which, however, remain elusive for the solution&#8208;processed ones. Here, a strategic molecular design for solution processable TADF emitters featuring high &#920;&#8741;s is proposed by attaching flexible chains ended with bipolar 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] subunits as anchoring groups onto TADF emitting core. It's unveiled that the anchoring groups not only enhance the horizontal orientation via enlarging molecular planarity, but also benefit the high photoluminescence in pristine films. The corresponding non&#8208;doped solution processable OLEDs substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax)&gt;30&#8201;%. Meanwhile, combining these compounds as TADF sensitizers, and multiple resonance final emitter, solution&#8208;processed OLEDs achieve an EQEmax of 25.6&#8201;% with a narrow full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of an Aryl&#8208;Alkene Axis by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of axially chiral acyclic aryl&#8208;alkene skeletons via classic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction has been challenging compared to the biaryls. Rational optimization established an enabling 3,3&#8242;&#8208;triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted phosphite ligand for asymmetric coupling of hindered aryl halides and vinyl boronates under mild conditions, affording the acyclic aryl&#8208;alkenes in good yield, atroposelectivity and E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
The application of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction to forge the atropisomeric biaryls has seen remarkable progress but exploration of this chemistry to directly forge chiral C(aryl)&#8208;C(alkene) axis is underdeveloped. The replacement of arene substrates by alkenes intensifies the challenges in terms of reactivity, configurational atropostability of product and selectivity control. By meticulous ligand design and fine&#8208;tuning of reaction parameters, we identified a highly active 3,3&#8242;&#8208;triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted phosphite ligand to realize arene&#8208;alkene Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of hindered aryl halides and vinyl boronates under very mild conditions. The axially chiral acyclic aryl&#8208;alkenes were generated in commendable efficiency, enantioselectivity and E/Z selectivity.

         <title>Target&#8208;Triggered Formation of Artificial Enzymes on Filamentous Phage for Ultrasensitive Direct Detection of Circulating miRNA Biomarkers in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
As triggered by the target, an artificial enzyme was site&#8208;specifically formed at the tip of filamentous M13 phage, generating a novel catalytic nanomaterial for miRNA analysis. miRNAs in human plasma samples, tumor cells, and tissues were detected with high sensitivity comparable to qRT&#8208;PCR, showing a great possibility of clinical applications.







Abstract
Integrating artificial enzymes onto nanostructures target&#8208; and site&#8208;specifically is still a challenge. Here we show that target miRNAs trigger the formation of DNAzyme site&#8208;specifically at the tip of filamentous phage for detecting miRNA biomarkers. Through an antibody&#8208;modified oligonucleotide, the tip of the phage with magnetic nanoparticles on the sidewall captures a target miRNA, inducing the formation of DNAzyme that extends from the phage tip through a hybridization chain reaction. After magnetic separation, the resultant complex catalyzes a colorimetric reaction with the signal correlated to target concentrations, leading to the quantification of miRNAs with a detection limit of 5.0&#8197;fM, about 103 folds lower than the phage&#8208;free approach. Our approach can differentiate miRNA mutants and quantify miRNA in human plasma, tumor cells, and tissues with high sensitivity, suggesting that the target&#8208;triggered integration of enzymes and phages holds promise for searching for new catalysts.

         <title>Human Cyclophilin B Nuclease Activity Revealed via Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs electrochemical DNA&#8208;based sensors to investigate the hydrolytic activity of a previously unknown nuclease, cyclophilin B. The protein is secreted by pancreatic cancer cells and could be a biomarker for early&#8208;stage cancer diagnoses. However, the demonstrated nuclease activity will limit bioassay development based on natural nucleic acid aptamers. Instead, we propose DNA stereoisomers (l&#8208;DNA) to overcome this challenge.







Abstract
Human cyclophilin B (CypB) is oversecreted by pancreatic cancer cells, making it a potential biomarker for early&#8208;stage disease diagnosis. Our group is motivated to develop aptamer&#8208;based assays to measure CypB levels in biofluids. However, human cyclophilins have been postulated to have collateral nuclease activity, which could impede the use of aptamers for CypB detection. To establish if CypB can hydrolyze electrode&#8208;bound nucleic acids, we used ultrasensitive electrochemical sensors to measure CypB's hydrolytic activity. Our sensors use ssDNA and dsDNA in the biologically predominant d&#8208;DNA form, and in the nuclease resistant l&#8208;DNA form. Challenging such sensors with CypB and control proteins, we unequivocally demonstrate that CypB can cleave nucleic acids. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use electrochemical biosensors to reveal the hydrolytic activity of a protein that is not known to be a nuclease. Future development of CypB bioassays will require the use of nuclease&#8208;resistant aptamer sequences.

         <title>Simultaneous Photo&#8208;Induced Magnetic and Dielectric Switching in an Iron(II)&#8208;Based Spin&#8208;Crossover Hofmann&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>

A new 3D Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {Fe(bpt)[Pt(CN)4]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5anth (1, bpt=2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiophen; anth=anthracene) is prepared. It displays thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;switchable magnetic and dielectric properties accompanied by structural phase transitions between different space groups.







Abstract
Molecular materials possessing photo&#8208;tunable polarization switching is promising for optical switches, smart sensors, and data storage devices. However, it is challenging to devise a molecular material featuring simultaneous switchable magnetic and dielectric properties with regard to non&#8208;invasive and convenient light stimulus. Herein, we report a new Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {Fe(bpt)[Pt(CN)4]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5anth (1, bpt=2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiophen; anth=anthracene), which displays thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;switchable magnetic and dielectric properties. Photo&#8208;monitored structural analyses revealed that it was the photo&#8208;induced deformation of FeII coordination sphere and relative movement of guest anthracene that resulted in the variation of the local electric dipoles. These findings provide a new strategy to realize polarization switching through the light&#8208;induced spin crossover, and would be of fundamental significance for future photo&#8208;switchable and multifunctional materials.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Packing by Terminal tert&#8208;Butylation for Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Emission and Efficacious Charge Transport in an Anthracene&#8208;Based Molecular Crystal</title>

An anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal with a unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif has been developed by delicate crystal engineering through terminal tert&#8208;butylation. Appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling/electron&#8208;phonon coupling originating from the unique crystal packing induces a remarkably strong solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum efficiency, &#934;F=74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1).







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with combinative high carrier mobility and efficient solid&#8208;state emission are full of challenges but urgently pursued for developing new emerging optoelectronics. Herein, by delicately regulating the crystal packing of an anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal via terminal tert&#8208;butylation, we developed a superior high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;di(6&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnaphthyl)anthracene (TBU&#8208;DNA). The unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif of TBU&#8208;DNA enables its appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling and electron&#8208;phonon coupling, thus resulting in remarkably high solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;F&#8776;74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, OLETs based on TBU&#8208;DNA show an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest EQE values for single component OLETs reported till now. This work presents a crystal engineering strategy via exquisite molecular design to realize high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.

         <title>Bacterial Avenalumic Acid Biosynthesis Includes Substitution of an Aromatic Amino Group for Hydride by Nitrous Acid Dependent Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diazo group is highly reactive and provides biological activity to natural products. By genome mining of the diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes, an avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77. This pathway includes two enzymes, AvaA6 and AvaA7, catalyzing the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively.







Abstract
The diazo group is an important functional group that can confer biological activity to natural products owing to its high reactivity. Recent studies have revealed that diazo groups are synthesized from amino groups using nitrous acid in secondary metabolites of actinomycetes. However, genome database analysis indicated that there are still many diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes for unknown biosynthetic pathways. Here, we discovered an avenalumic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77 by genome mining of enzymes involved in diazo group formation. Through heterologous expression, the gene cluster was revealed to direct avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthesis via 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;AAA). In vitro enzyme assays showed that AvaA6 and AvaA7 catalyzed the diazotization of 3&#8208;AAA using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively. This study revealed an unprecedented pathway for amino group removal via diazotization.

         <title>Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) Tags for Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation, On&#8208;Resin Protein&#8208;Protein Coupling, and Purification of Protein Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry tags (ABC&#8208;tags) based on 2&#8208;pyridyltetrazines serve a dual role by enabling protein purification through metal chelation and still maintaining their rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging is successful for proteins tagged at the C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions, is successful in complex mixtures including cell lysate, and can be carried out on&#8208;resin to generate multidomain proteins.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of proteins has broad application in chemical biology, but can be limited when mixtures result from incomplete conversion or the formation of protein containing side products. It is shown here that when proteins are covalently tagged with pyridyl&#8208;tetrazines, the nickel&#8208;iminodiacetate (Ni&#8208;IDA) resins commonly used for His&#8208;tags can be directly used for protein affinity purification. These Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) tags serve a dual role by enabling affinity&#8208;based protein purification while maintaining rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging works with a range of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods with proteins tagged at the C&#8208;terminus, N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions. ABC&#8208;tagged proteins can also be purified from complex mixtures including cell lysate. The combination of site&#8208;selective conjugation and clean&#8208;up with ABC&#8208;tagged proteins also allows for facile on&#8208;resin reactions to provide protein&#8208;protein conjugates.

Although aryl thioamides are often used to assess the pharmacological effects of H2S, their reactivity is extremely sluggish and their release of H2S is highly inefficient. Herein, we report that H2S liberation from this donor class can be augmented with intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. We envision this new chemistry serving as a general design strategy for accessing efficient donors that selectively respond to various biological stimuli.







Abstract
Arylthioamides have been frequently employed to assess the chemical biology and pharmacology of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). From this class of donors, however, extremely low H2S releasing efficiencies have been reported and proper mechanistic studies have been omitted. Consequently, millimolar concentrations of arylthioamides are required to liberate just trace amounts of H2S, and via an unidentified mechanistic pathway, which obfuscates the interpretation of any biological activity that stems from their use. Herein, we report that H2S release from this valuable class of donors can be markedly enhanced through intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. Specifically, we demonstrate that both disulfide&#8208; and diselenide&#8208;linked thioamides are responsive to biologically relevant concentrations of glutathione and release two molar equivalents of H2S via an intramolecular cyclization that significantly augments their rate and efficiency of sulfide delivery in both buffer and live human cells.

         <title>A Library of Rare Earth Oxide Ultrathin Nanowires with Polymer&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile colloidal method to synthesize ultrathin nanowires at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) is developed. The mechanism of nanocrystal growth along different dimensions is discussed. Fifteen kinds of RE&#8208;Mo&#8208;O (RE=Y, La&#8208;Nd, and Sm&#8208;Lu) ultrathin nanowires could be synthesized using this method. All of them exhibited polymer&#8208;like behavior.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanowires (NWs) have always attracted the attention of researchers due to their unique properties, but their facile synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein we developed a general method for the synthesis of rare earth (RE) oxide ultrathin NWs at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C). The formation mechanism of ultrathin NWs lies in two aspects: thermodynamic advantage of one dimensional (1D) growth at low temperature, and supplement of effective monomers. As an extension, fifteen kinds of RE oxide ultrathin NWs were synthesized through this strategy, and they all exhibited polymer&#8208;like behaviors. Meanwhile, the high viscosity, organic gel, wet&#8208; and electro&#8208;spinning of Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O NWs were studied in detail, demonstrating the similarity of ultrathin inorganic NWs to polymers. In addition, the Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O ultrathin NWs were used as photocatalysts for toluene oxidation and showed excellent performance with toluene conversion ratio of 83.8&#8201;%, suggesting their potential application in organic photocatalysis.

         <title>Quantum Interference in Mixed&#8208;Valence Complexes: Tuning Electronic Coupling Through Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of ground state electronic interaction in the mixed&#8208;valence complex [{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H4)]+ can be tuned through the introduction of an OMe substituent to the bridging ligand. These effects are sensitive to the position of the substituent, and follow the same patterns as those predicted by quantum circuit rules for weakly coupled molecules in molecular junctions.







Abstract
Whilst 2&#8208; or 5&#8208;OMe groups on the bridging phenylene ring in [{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H4)]+ have little influence on the electronic structure of this weakly coupled mixed&#8208;valence complex, a 4&#8208;OMe substituent enhances ground state electron delocalization, and increases the intensity of the IVCT transition. Vibrational frequency and TDDFT calculations (LH20t&#8208;D3(BJ), def2&#8208;SVP, COSMO (CH2Cl2)) on ([{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H3&#8208;n&#8208;OMe)]+ (n=2, 4, 5) models are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The stronger ground state coupling is attributed to the change in composition of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO brought about by the 4&#8208;OMe group, which is ortho or para to each of the metal fragments. The intensity of the IVCT transition increases with the greater overlap of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO, whilst the relative phases of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO in the 4&#8208;OMe substituted complex are consistent with predictions of constructive quantum interference from molecular circuit rules.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Phase Separation Behavior and Pathway&#8208;Directed Information Exchange in all&#8208;DNA Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage mechanism is discovered in the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation pathways of ssDNA to form all&#8208;DNA coacervates. Distinct ion&#8208;specific pathways allow the generation of new coacervate structures by mixing multiple coacervate systems, leading to pathway&#8208;controlled coacervate&#8208;protocell communication and information exchange.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation provides a versatile approach to fabricating cell&#8208;mimicking coacervates. Recently, it was discovered that phase separation of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows for forming protocells and microgels in multicomponent systems. However, the mechanism of the ssDNA phase separation is not comprehensively understood. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation of ssDNA and leverage this understanding for a straightforward formation of all&#8208;DNA droplets. Two phase separation temperatures are found that correspond to the formation of primary nuclei and a growth process. Ca2+ allows for irreversible, whereas Mg2+ leads to reversible phase separation. Capitalizing on these differences makes it possible to control the information transfer of one&#8208;component DNA droplets and two&#8208;component core&#8211;shell protocells. This study introduces new kinetic traps of phase separating ssDNA that lead to new phenomena in cell&#8208;mimicking systems.

         <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Michaelis&#8211;Menten Kinetic Rates and Its Application to the Analysis of CRISPR&#8208;Based Diagnostics</title>

The estimation of Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetic parameters is highly sensitive to small experimental errors, even though the quantification of such parameters is critical. Monte Carlo simulations show that the kinetic efficiency, which governs limit of detection of assays that require low background, is the most precise kinetic parameter.







Abstract
Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics is an essential model to rationalize enzyme reactions. The quantification of Michaelis&#8211;Menten parameters can be very challenging as it is sensitive to even small experimental errors. We here present a quantification of the uncertainty inherent to the experimental determination of kinetic rate parameters for enzymatic reactions. We study the influence of several sources of uncertainty and bias, including the inner filter effect, pipetting errors, number of points in the Michaelis&#8211;Menten curve, and flat&#8208;field correction. Using Monte Carlo simulations and analyses of experimental data, we compute typical uncertainties of 
, 
, and catalytic efficiency 
. As a salient example, we analyze the extraction of such parameters for CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems. CRISPR diagnostics have recently attracted much interest and yet reports of these enzymatic kinetic rates have been highly unreliable and inconsistent.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;enzymatic circuitry activation strategy can realize an orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit through multiple molecular recognition events and progressively accelerated signal amplification, as reported by Fuan Wang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202206529). The on&#8208;site activated CCD circuitry system has considerable potential for high&#8208;precision in&#8197;vivo imaging of low&#8208;abundance microRNA.

An anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal with a unique "slipped herringbone" packing motif was developed by crystal engineering through terminal tert&#8208;butylation. Appropriate exciton&#8211;exciton coupling/electron&#8211;phonon coupling originating from the unique crystal packing induces a remarkably strong solid&#8208;state emission and efficient charge transport, as reported by Wenping Hu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202206825).

         <dc:description>
A proton conductive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a C3&#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid derivative with an 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether component. Despite the flexibility of the macrocycle, H&#8208;bonding modules allow the derivative to yield a hexagonally networked framework with permanent porosity. As reported by Takayoshi Nakamura, Ichiro Hisaki, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202211686), the HOF possesses 1D channels with a bottleneck composed of the macrocycles and shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through the Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of ultrathin nanowires has thermodynamic advantages at low temperature. However, at low temperatures the monomers for nanocrystal growth are difficult to generate through precursor decomposition. In their Research Article (e202212251), Di Qiu, Yaping Du, and co&#8208;workers report an efficient growth process based on adding polyoxometalate clusters to the monomers. Fifteen types of rare earth oxide ultrathin nanowires were synthesized, all exhibiting polymer&#8208;like behavior due to the extremely high aspect ratio.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Plant&#8208;Produced Toxin Strychnine Elucidated</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strychnine is a notorious neurotoxic plant alkaloid that has been studied for centuries. A recent report from the O'Connor group has successfully elucidated the biosynthesis of strychnine for the first time using modern transcriptomics and protein expression methods, laying a foundation for future studies to engineer production or modifications of this important natural product.







Abstract
While natural products isolated from plants have historically been an important source of bioactive molecules, elucidating their biosynthetic pathways has remained a challenging process. Strychnine is the one such compound known for its neurotoxicity and use as a rodent pesticide. Considerable interest has been shown in the synthesis of strychnine for many decades, yet little was known about its biosynthesis. A recent report from the O'Connor lab has solved this long&#8208;standing puzzle using modern transcriptomics and transient expression approaches to uncover each enzyme responsible for the production of strychnine along with an unexpected final non&#8208;enzymatic step.

         <title>Bimetallic Catalysis in Stereodivergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an important strategy for developing new reactions in stereodivergent synthesis. This strategy is also a simple and powerful approach for synthesizing all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters from the same set of starting materials. This Minireview summarizes recent progress and briefly gives perspectives for the future advancement of this field.







Abstract
Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis, whereby all the possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters can be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this Minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.

         <title>The Control of the Coordination Chemistry for the Genesis of Heterogeneous Catalytically Active Sites in Oxidation Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of coordination metal complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of fine chemicals is reviewed. Specific attention is paid to describing the phenomena leading to the genesis of the active sites, the clear characterization of the surface species, and their catalytic performance.







Abstract
This Review provides a summary of the use and the role of coordination complexes as precursors for the generation of heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation reactions of interest for fine chemical synthesis. Specific attention is paid to the comprehension of phenomena explaining the formation of active sites in heterogeneous catalysts. Different families of coordination precursors are considered. For each example, a brief critical description of the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance is reported. Special attention is paid to the chemical environment of the first coordination sphere of the active metal centre. The catalysts obtained by heterogenization, grafting, or anchoring of homogeneous catalysts can therefore exhibit enhanced catalytic performance by merging advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The deposition of coordination complexes over a preformed support is indeed a conceptually versatile strategy to design novel catalysts with tuned and controlled properties.

         <title>Rationally Designing Efficient Electrocatalysts for Direct Seawater Splitting: Challenges, Achievements, and Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides an overview of electrocatalysts designed for the direct splitting of seawater. The mechanism of seawater splitting is introduced before the primary principles for designing catalysts (noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free) for seawater splitting are analyzed in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The future development of electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen generation is also discussed.







Abstract
Directly splitting seawater to produce hydrogen provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. However, current seawater splitting faces many challenges because of the sluggish kinetics, the presence of impurities, membrane contamination, and the competitive chloride oxidation reaction at the anode, which makes it more difficult than freshwater splitting. This Review firstly introduces the basic mechanisms of the anode and cathode reactions during seawater splitting. We critically analyze the primary principles for designing catalysts for seawater splitting in terms of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, including with noble metal, noble metal free, and metal&#8208;free catalysts. Strategies to design effective catalysts, such as active site population, synergistic effect regulation, and surface engineering, are discussed. Furthermore, promises, perspectives, and challenges in developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized.

         <title>Antibiotic&#8208;Derived Radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography: Nuclear or &#8220;Unclear&#8221; Infection Imaging?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides summary and critical evaluation, including the challenges and pitfalls, of antibiotic&#8208;derived positron emission tomographic radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging either considered for radiotracer development for infection imaging or radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization.







Abstract
The excellent features of non&#8208;invasive molecular imaging, its progressive technology (real&#8208;time, whole&#8208;body imaging and quantification), and global impact by a growing infrastructure for positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are encouraging prospects to investigate new concepts, which could transform clinical care of complex infectious diseases. Researchers are aiming towards the extension beyond the routinely available radiopharmaceuticals and are looking for more effective tools that interact directly with causative pathogens. We reviewed and critically evaluated (challenges or pitfalls) antibiotic&#8208;derived PET radiopharmaceutical development efforts aimed at infection imaging. We considered both radiotracer development for infection imaging and radio&#8208;antibiotic PET imaging supplementing other tools for pharmacologic drug characterization; overall, a total of 20 original PET radiotracers derived from eleven approved antibiotics.

         <title>In Situ Inhibitor Synthesis and Screening by Fluorescence Polarization: An Efficient Approach for Accelerating Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>

In situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS) links high&#8208;throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening tor target binding by fluorescence, as exemplified by the efficient identification of in vivo orally active inhibitors of PHD2, a target for anemia treatment.







Abstract
Target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry has emerged as a useful tool for hit identification, but has not been widely used, in part due to challenges associated with analyses involving complex mixtures. We describe an operationally simple alternative: in situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS), which links high&#8208;throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening for target binding by fluorescence. We exemplify the ISISS method by showing how coupling screening for target binding by fluorescence polarization with the reaction of acyl&#8208;hydrazides and aldehydes led to the efficient discovery of a potent and novel acylhydrazone&#8208;based inhibitor of human prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a target for anemia treatment, with equivalent in vivo potency to an approved medicine.

     alt="In Situ Inhibitor Synthesis and Screening by Fluorescence Polarization: An Efficient Approach for Accelerating Drug Discovery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS) links high-throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening tor target binding by fluorescence, as exemplified by the efficient identification of in vivo orally active inhibitors of PHD2, a target for anemia treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry has emerged as a useful tool for hit identification, but has not been widely used, in part due to challenges associated with analyses involving complex mixtures. We describe an operationally simple alternative: in situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS), which links high-throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening for target binding by fluorescence. We exemplify the ISISS method by showing how coupling screening for target binding by fluorescence polarization with the reaction of acyl-hydrazides and aldehydes led to the efficient discovery of a potent and novel acylhydrazone-based inhibitor of human prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a target for anemia treatment, with equivalent in vivo potency to an approved medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage Carboranes for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage carbazole&#8208;modified carboranes emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL). The |gPL| factors of (R/S)&#8208;Cb1 and (R/S)&#8208;Cb2 enantiomers in films reached 7.38&#215;10&#8722;3. Significant solvation effect was observed in the fluorescence and CPL of Cb1, while Cb2 showed remarkable AIECL effect with excellent ECL stability and dopamine detection ability.







Abstract
Herein, we report the structures of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage carborane derivatives bearing carbazole chromophores that emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL). By adjusting the substituent positions on the carborane derivatives, two chiral luminescent molecules, Cb1 and Cb2, with different properties were obtained. The photoluminescence dissymmetry factors |gPL| of both (R/S)&#8208;Cb1 and (R/S)&#8208;Cb2 enantiomers in neat films were as high as 6.24&#215;10&#8722;3 and 7.38&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. Cb1 showed a deep blue emission peak at 434&#8197;nm in n&#8208;pentane. Interestingly, distinct fluorescence and CPL spectra were observed in solvents of different polarities due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect, suggesting its potential use in solvent recognition. Meanwhile, Cb2 exhibited good AIECL property, excellent ECL stability and could be used for determining dopamine concentrations, suggesting its potential applications in biology and diagnosis.

         <title>Isoxazole Nucleosides as Building Blocks for a Plausible Proto&#8208;RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotically plausible isoxazole nucleosides are shown to be excellent candidates for proto&#8208;nucleosides and proto&#8208;RNAs. The proto&#8208;nucleoside forms 2 instructive H&#8208;bonds with guanosine and can directly rearrange in RNA to give cytidine. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction is controlled by already present canonical seed&#8208;nucleosides.







Abstract
The question of how RNA, as the principal carrier of genetic information evolved is fundamentally important for our understanding of the origin of life. The RNA molecule is far too complex to have formed in one evolutionary step, suggesting that ancestral proto&#8208;RNAs (first ancestor of RNA) may have existed, which evolved over time into the RNA of today. Here we show that isoxazole nucleosides, which are quickly formed from hydroxylamine, cyanoacetylene, urea and ribose, are plausible precursors for RNA. The isoxazole nucleoside can rearrange within an RNA&#8208;strand to give cytidine, which leads to an increase of pairing stability. If the proto&#8208;RNA contains a canonical seed&#8208;nucleoside with defined stereochemistry, the seed&#8208;nucleoside can control the configuration of the anomeric center that forms during the in&#8208;RNA transformation. The results demonstrate that RNA could have emerged from evolutionarily primitive precursor isoxazole ribosides after strand formation.

         <title>Quantifying the Influence of Covalent Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding on Differing Reactivity of Trivalent Uranium and Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report experimental and computational studies that quantify the measured effect of variations in metal&#8208;ligand covalency on the reactivity of phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent uranium and similarly sized lanthanides.







Abstract
Qualitative differences in the reactivity of trivalent lanthanide and actinide complexes have long been attributed to differences in covalent metal&#8208;ligand bonding, but there are few examples where thermodynamic aspects of this relationship have been quantified, especially with U3+ and in the absence of competing variables. Here we report a series of dimeric phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent f&#8208;metals that show how shorter&#8208;than&#8208;expected U&#8722;B distances indicative of increased covalency give rise to measurable differences in solution deoligomerization reactivity when compared to isostructural complexes with similarly sized lanthanides. These results, which are in excellent agreement with supporting DFT and QTAIM calculations, afford rare experimental evidence concerning the measured effect of variations in metal&#8208;ligand covalency on the reactivity of trivalent uranium and lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Conformational Effects on the Threading Kinetics of Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped Guests into the Cavity of Oxatub[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex kinetic behavior was observed in a two&#8208;component system containing a viologen&#8208;based guest and oxatub[4]arene through the involvement of the three conformers of the host. In addition, an unprecedented threading mechanism involving the tilted conformation of the guests was revealed to be responsible for the very fast kinetics and for the threading of guests with very large stoppers.







Abstract
Unprecedented threading kinetics were revealed between viologen&#8208;based guests and conformationally adaptive oxatub[4]arene. Three representative conformations of oxatub[4]arene are involved in the kinetic and thermodynamic products which follow the opposite orders in their rankings. Consequently, error correction was involved and a complex kinetic process was observed in a simple two&#8208;component system. Moreover, it was found that some viologen&#8208;based guests have much faster threading kinetics than those of DABCO&#8208;based with the same stoppers. This was enabled by an unprecedented threading mechanism in which a tilted conformation of the guests is adopted by involving one linear alkyl group on the 3,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzyl stoppers, the viologen core, and the methylene spacers in the transition states. This new mechanism even allows the viologen&#8208;based guests with the 3,5&#8208;dicetyloxybenzyl stoppers to form a pseudorotaxane with oxatub[4]arene.

The complex was structurally characterized by Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses, such as MEPS, show the W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond is primarily an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a smaller degree of covalent character.







Abstract
The coordination complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4, was synthesized in CFCl3 solvent by reaction of the weak fluoride&#8208;ion donor and strong oxidative fluorinating agent, XeF4, with the moderate&#8208;strength fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor, WOF4. The compound is the only transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of XeIV and was characterized at low temperatures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4 coordinate trans to the W=O bond through a W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond. The XeF3 moiety of F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4 acquires a degree of [XeF3]+ character upon coordination that is reflected by its Xe&#8722;F stretching frequencies which are intermediate with respect to those of XeF4 and [XeF3]+. Calculations show W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb is predominantly an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a significant orbital contribution that accounts for the bent Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W angle. The calculations show F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 (M=Cr, Mo) are less stable than their W analogue, consistent with failed attempts to synthesize F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MoOF4.

         <title>Engineering Support and Distribution of Palladium and Tin on MXene with Modulation of the d&#8208;Band Center for CO&#8208;resilient Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosted electron interaction of metal nano&#8208;alloy with Se&#8208;doped MXene and optimized distribution of Pd&#8722;Sn sites on PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 can modulate the d band center, decrease adsorption energies of CO* at Pd site and enhance OH* generation at Sn site, thus removing CO poisonous intermediates, and thereby significantly enhancing methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) efficiency and durability of the anodic catalyst for a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).







Abstract
The efficiency of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is largely determined by the activity and durability of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalysts. Herein, we present a CO&#8208;resilient MOR catalyst of palladium&#8208;tin nano&#8208;alloy anchored on Se&#8208;doped MXene (PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2) via a progressive one&#8208;step electrochemical deposition strategy. MOR mass activity resulting from Pd/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 catalyst (1046.2&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1) is over 2&#8208;fold larger than that of Pd/Ti3C2, suggesting that the introduction of Se atoms on MXene might accelerate the reaction kinetics. PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 with Se&#8208;doping progress of MXene and the cooperated Pd&#8722;Sn sites has a superior MOR mass activity (4762.8&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1), outperforming many other reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Both experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal that boosted electron interaction of metal crystals with Se&#8208;doped MXene and optimized distribution of Pd&#8722;Sn sites can modulate the d band center, reduce adsorption energies of CO* at Pd site and enhance OH* generation at Sn site, resulting in highly efficient removal of CO intermediates by reaction with neighboring OH species on adjacent Sn sites.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Exposed Single&#8208;Ni Atoms with Potential&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behaviors for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced electrocatalyst has been developed by decorating single&#8208;Ni atoms on hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS) for the oxygen evolution reaction. Thanks to the abundantly surface&#8208;exposed single&#8208;Ni atoms, hollow S/N&#8208;codoped carbon matrix, as well as their strong synergistic interactions, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Trapping the active sites on the exterior surface of hollow supports can reduce mass transfer resistance and enhance atomic utilization. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize single&#8208;Ni atoms decorated hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS). Specifically, the CdS@3&#8208;aminophenol/formaldehyde is carbonized into S/N&#8208;FCS. The gas&#8208;migrated Ni species are anchored on the surface of S/N&#8208;FCS simultaneously, yielding Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 249&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 56.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and ultra&#8208;long stability up to 166&#8197;hours without obvious fading. Moreover, the potential&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of Ni&#8208;N4 sites and the contribution of the S dopant at different locations in the matrix to the OER activity are revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Areal Density Single&#8208;Atoms/Metal Oxide Nanosheets: A Micro&#8208;Gas Blasting Synthesis and Superior Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) synthesis is developed to access versatile high&#8208;areal density noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Pt1/CeO2, Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. The as&#8208;prepared Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance than routinely structured alternatives by using water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) as a model reaction.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets are conducive to not only endow opened surfaces for loading active metal atoms but also boost the mass transfer for the heterogeneous reactions. The challenge is how to load and stabilize single&#8208;atoms on nanosheets in high&#8208;areal densities. This work reports an efficient micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) strategy to access versatile noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. Especially for Pt/CeO2 nanosheets (Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S), the Pt loading is increased to 15&#8197;at%. The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts from MGB are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance in the model reaction of water&#8208;gas shift (WGS). The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalyst exhibit 2&#8211;3&#8197;times reactivity that of their thicker counterpart, single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 microspheric catalyst. Moreover, the single&#8208;atom sites in Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S (1&#8211;10&#8201;%) catalysts are stable in a harsh WGS reaction condition of 10&#8201;% CO. This work thus paves a way to access the practical single&#8208;atom catalysts.

This work thus paves a way to access the practical single-atom catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Insights into Physical Aging&#8208;Induced Structure Evolution in Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>

         <dc:description>
CMS membranes derived from polyimide precursors show dual model morphologies comprising a disordered continuous phase and distributed molecular sieving Langmuir domains. Our study showed that during physical aging, pore structure changes in the two different &#8220;C&#8221; phase and &#8220;L&#8221; domains both occur, which affects the gas separation performance of CMS membranes.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes offer the best available combination of scalable economical processability with excellent separation performance. Physical aging of CMS membranes causes pore structure changes over time that affect CMS membrane performance. To provide fundamental insights into the structure evolution in CMS membranes during physical aging, a combined dual&#8208;mode sorption and transport model is used in this study to characterize the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in fresh and 7&#8208;day vacuum aged CMS membranes. The results show physical aging of CMS membrane is primarily &#8220;diffusion related&#8221; and such aging behavior simultaneously causes ultramicropore changes in the continuous phase and Langmuir phase of CMS membrane. The new insights offered in this study suggest strategies to control the physical aging of CMS membranes and even use it as a valuable tool to tune the separation performance of CMS membranes for demanding gas separations.

         <title>A Proton Conductive Porous Framework of an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6&#8208;Ether Derivative Networked by Rigid Hydrogen Bonding Modules</title>

A porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF) was constructed from a 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) derivative. Although a 18C6 macrocycle is flexible and has many possible conformations, directional intermolecular hydrogen bonds of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl modules in the periphery of the 18C6 allowed to form a rigid HOF with 1D channels with a bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The wet HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through a Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH.







Abstract
A rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a C3&#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid with a hydrophilic 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) component. Despite the flexible macrocyclic structure with many conformations, the derivative with three 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties in the periphery yielded a rigid layered porous framework through directional intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, the HOF possesses 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH. The present unique water channel structure provides an inspiration to create molecular porous materials.

         <title>Modelling Conformational Flexibility in a Spectrally Addressable Molecular Multi&#8208;Qubit Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 45, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systems with weak dipolar interactions have the potential to be used for molecular quantum computing. Orientation selective pulsed EPR was used to model the conformational flexibility of a molecular multi&#8208;qubit model system. Spectrally addressable centres allowed for the individual manipulation of each spin qubit, while differing relaxation dynamics resulted in a proposed handle for the implementation of quantum algorithms.







Abstract
Dipolar coupled multi&#8208;spin systems have the potential to be used as molecular qubits. Herein we report the synthesis of a molecular multi&#8208;qubit model system with three individually addressable, weakly interacting, spin 
 centres of differing g&#8208;values. We use pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) techniques to characterise and separately address the individual electron spin qubits; CuII, Cr7Ni ring and a nitroxide, to determine the strength of the inter&#8208;qubit dipolar interaction. Orientation selective Relaxation&#8208;Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (os&#8208;RIDME) detecting across the CuII spectrum revealed a strongly correlated CuII&#8208;Cr7Ni ring relationship; detecting on the nitroxide resonance measured both the nitroxide and CuII or nitroxide and Cr7Ni ring correlations, with switchability of the interaction based on differing relaxation dynamics, indicating a handle for implementing EPR&#8208;based quantum information processing (QIP) algorithms.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative&#160;Coupling of Difluoroalkenes and Aryl Boronic Acids for Ketone&#160;Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction is a useful approach for ketone synthesis. But it is often problematic to use exogenous carbonyl reagents, such as the gaseous carbon monoxide. In this manuscript, we report a novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of  gem  &#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl boronic acids that yields bioactive indane&#8208;type ketones with an all&#8208;carbon &#945;&#8208;quaternary center. Characterization and stoichiometric reactions of the key intermediates RCF  2  Pd  II  support a water&#8208;induced defluorination and cross&#8208;coupling cascade mechanism. The vinyl difluoromethylene motif serves as an  in&#8208;situ  carbonyl precursor which is unprecedented in the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. It is expected to raise broad research interest from the perspectives of ketone synthesis, fluoroalkene functionalization, and rational design of new synthetic protocols based on the unique reactivity of difluoroalkyl palladium(II) species</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoproteomics&#8208;Enabled Identification of 4&#8208;Oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactams as Inhibitors of Dipeptidyl Peptidases 8 and 9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving Dipeptidyl Peptidase 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) selectivity is a current challenge in chemical biology. Supported by activity&#8208;based protein profiling and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclose 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors with different binding modes for DPP8/9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; subsite in DPP8 and the best selectivity index reported to date.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) have gathered interest as drug targets due to their important roles in biological processes like immunity and tumorigenesis. Elucidation of their distinct individual functions remains an ongoing task and could benefit from the availability of novel, chemically diverse and selective chemical tools. Here, we report the activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP)&#8208;mediated discovery of 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams as potent, non&#8208;substrate&#8208;like nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic structures revealed different ligand binding modes for DPP8 and DPP9, including an unprecedented targeting of an extended S2&#8242; (eS2&#8242;) subsite in DPP8. Biological assays confirmed inhibition at both target and cellular levels. Altogether, our integrated chemical proteomics and structure&#8208;guided small molecule design approach led to novel DPP8/9 inhibitors with alternative molecular inhibition mechanisms, delivering the highest selectivity index reported to date.

         <title>Semisynthetic Viral Inhibitor for Light Control of the MHC I Peptide Loading Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immune system supervises every cell via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, which are prepared in the peptide loading complex (PLC). Using a light&#8208;activated viral nanotool, the authors succeeded in spatiotemporally controlling antigen processing and reconstituting a completely active native PLC. The photo&#8208;conditional function of PLC was analyzed with a flow cytometry&#8208;based assay at single&#8208;organelle resolution.







Abstract
The immune system detects virally or malignantly transformed cells via peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex class&#8197;I (pMHC&#8197;I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC I molecules are loaded with cargo peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the highly dynamic multiprotein peptide loading complex (PLC). Here, we developed a semisynthetic approach to generate a photocleavable immune modulator ICP47 of Herpes simplex virus. Using this nanotool, we revealed key mechanistic events of the purified PLC, such as peptide binding and translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, triggered by light. We established a single&#8208;organelle flow cytometry assay to monitor light&#8208;controlled activation of the antigen processing machinery in native ER membranes. This photochemical modulation opens new opportunities for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the antigen processing machinery in vitro and native membrane environment.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Organoplatinum(II) Complexes for Subcellular Distribution and Cell Viability Monitoring with Differentiated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation affinities of the platinum(II) complexes enable them to exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red, attributed to the extent of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The platinum(II) complex is applied to manifest the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells.







Abstract
The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self&#8208;assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.

         <dc:description>
An interpretable hybrid machine learning framework is designed for post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion battery (e.g. lithium&#8208;sulfur battery) forecast using lab&#8208;scale battery dataset with compromised quality and tremendous variables. Key knowledge about the complex and dynamic degradation chemistries is extracted to illuminate future battery design and optimization.







Abstract
The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9&#8201;% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of a previously unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte amount to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.

         <title>CO2 Hydrogenation over Copper/ZnO Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Water&#8208;Promoted Transient Synthesis of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acting as a bridge for hydrogen atoms during CO2 hydrogenation, water facilitates the transformation of relatively stable intermediates for enhancing the activity which in turn produces more water to react with CO via the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. As a result, the yield of methanol is promoted by a suitable amount of water over Cu single atoms on ZnO supports.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 by renewable power&#8208;generated hydrogen offers a promising approach to a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the role of water during CO2 hydrogenation is still under debate. Herein, we demonstrated that either too low or too high contents of water hampered the methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO based catalysts. For Cu single atoms on ZnO supports, the optimal content of water was 0.11&#8197;vol.&#8201;% under 30&#8197;bar (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;H2=1&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 170&#8201;&#176;C. Upon the introduction of optimal&#8208;content water, the methanol selectivity immediately became 99.1&#8201;%, meanwhile the conversion of CO2 underwent a volcano&#8208;type trend with the maximum of 4.9&#8201;%. According to mechanistic studies, water acted as a bridge between H atoms and CO2/intermediates, facilitating the transformation of COOH* and CH2O*. The enhanced activity induced the generation of more water to react with CO via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, resulting in the increase in methanol selectivity.

         <title>Modular Construction of Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives by Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a highly selective radical cascade&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAA) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal the excited state of an in situ&#8208;generated oxazolone enolate as a key intermediate, which functions both as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single&#8208;step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs. This synthesis takes place under mild conditions with an absence of metals, photocatalysts, and all other additives. We demonstrate the broad applications of this approach on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, alkenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and oxazolones. The results prove that our method provides excellent functional group tolerance and late&#8208;stage applicability, as well as gram&#8208;scale synthesis via flow chemistry. Additionally, we include mechanistic studies which reveal that the excited state of oxazolone enolate upon light excitation is a key intermediate that acts as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a stable electrolyte by using alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive to realize the antifreezing property and the stable Zn anode in alkaline condition. Leveraging the high reversibility and good antifreezing property, the fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with good electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1&#8197;M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700&#8197;h cycle at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C at 0.5&#8197;C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at 2&#8197;C.

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far does the influence of a proton reach in water? X&#8208;ray spectroscopy reveals how&#8212;layer by layer&#8212;the electronic structure of water molecules is altered when hydrating a proton. A general architectural hierarchy exists in which the proton strongly interacts with the three nearest water molecules to form a hybridized H7O3+&#160;core while the first hydration shell is affected by the electric field of the proton&#8216;s positive charge. Further solvation shells contain bulk&#8208;like water molecules, as reported by Ehud Pines, Philippe Wernet, Michael Odelius, Erik&#8197;T.&#8197;J.

&lt;p&gt;How far does the influence of a proton reach in water? X-ray spectroscopy reveals how&#8212;layer by layer&#8212;the electronic structure of water molecules is altered when hydrating a proton. A general architectural hierarchy exists in which the proton strongly interacts with the three nearest water molecules to form a hybridized H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;core while the first hydration shell is affected by the electric field of the proton&#8216;s positive charge. Further solvation shells contain bulk-like water molecules, as reported by Ehud Pines, Philippe Wernet, Michael Odelius, Erik&#8197;T.&#8197;J. Nibbering et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202211066"&gt;10.1002/anie.202211066&lt;/a&gt;).

         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive polymers undergo phase separation in response to changes in temperature. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209530), Simon Harrisson, Colin Bonduelle et&#8197;al. present the use of synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibiting temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.

         <title>The Dynamic Formation from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks of High&#8208;Density Platinum Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of metal cations in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a cation exchange process is governed by the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base (HSAB) principle. During pyrolysis, the evolution of first&#8208;shell Pt&#8208;ligand coordination determines the formation of the Pt&#8722;Pt second&#8208;shell coordination, which promotes the immobilization of Pt atoms as high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts in the Co3O4 host.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis, yet the practical applications require the development of high&#8208;density active sites with flexible geometric structures. The lack of understanding in the dynamic formation process of single atoms in the host framework has been plaguing the controllable synthesis of next generation SACs. Here using Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a starting substrate, we fully elucidated the formation of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms with inter&#8208;site interactions in derived Co3O4 host. The cation exchange process and dynamic evolution of Pt&#8722;Pt interactions, organic ligand cleavage and Pt&#8208;oxygen coordination formation during the pyrolysis process have been unambiguously interpreted by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical computation. These findings would direct the synthesis of high&#8208;density SACs with metal&#8208;metal interactions, which demonstrate significantly enhanced structural flexibility and catalytic properties.

         <title>Development of Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the role of nucleic acids as biorecognition and/or reporter probes in electrochemical biosensors. It highlights specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based electrochemical sensors that have been evaluated with clinical or clinically relevant samples for the management of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this Minireview, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoreversible polymorph transitions&#160;in supramolecular polymers&#160;are reported in the Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213345) by Juan Arag&#243;, Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. This behavior was observed in a new family of squaramides that self&#8208;assemble into particles at room temperature and undergo a reversible morphological transformation into fibers by cooling the sample.&#160;This transformation is triggered by a molecular rearrangement of the aggregated system implying a change in the squaramide hydrogen bonding pattern.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening of an Artificial Metalloenzyme using Double Emulsions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was screened in vivo using a high&#8208;throughput microfluidics&#8208;based assay. Single E. coli cells expressing streptavidin were encapsulated in double emulsion droplets together with a fluorogenic substrate and a cofactor catalyzing the reaction to yield a fluorescent product. Using this method, a 400&#8208;member library was screened, and the same hits found previously in a 96&#8208;well plate assay were identified.







Abstract
The potential for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput compartmentalization renders droplet microfluidics an attractive tool for the directed evolution of enzymes. Importantly, it ensures maintenance of the phenotype&#8208;genotype linkage, enabling reliable identification of improved mutants. Herein, we report an approach for ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening of an artificial metalloenzyme in double emulsion droplets (DEs) using commercially available fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorters (FACS). This protocol was validated by screening a 400 double&#8208;mutant streptavidin library for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed deallylation of an alloc&#8208;protected aminocoumarin. The most active variants, identified by next&#8208;generation sequencing, were in good agreement with hits obtained using a 96&#8208;well plate procedure. These findings pave the way for the systematic implementation of FACS for the directed evolution of (artificial) enzymes and will significantly expand the accessibility of ultrahigh&#8208;throughput DE screening protocols.

         <title>Overcoming Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis Resistance via a 19F/1H&#8208;MRI Traceable Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core&#8208;shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable 19F&#8208;MRI/1H&#8208;MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesize a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB)@manganese oxide (MnOx) core&#8208;shell nanoparticles (PM&#8208;CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O2 as fuel, PM&#8208;CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O2 can relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM&#8208;CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221; 19F&#8208;MRI signal and activatable T1/T2&#8208;MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM&#8208;CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O2&#8208;mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.

&lt;p&gt;A perfluorocarbon@MnOx core-shell nanostructure for overcoming the tumor microenvironment hypoxia-induced ferroptosis resistance via direct delivery of oxygen into the tumor is presented. Using this nanoplatform, activatable &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-MRI/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRI imaging of ferroptosis initiation is also demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia-induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesize a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB)@manganese oxide (MnOx) core-shell nanoparticles (PM-CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as fuel, PM-CS NPs can induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM-CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221; &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-MRI signal and activatable T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM-CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable probes capable of generating switchable multimodal imaging signals upon interaction with a molecular target of interest have attracted much attention in the past few years. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in the development of activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and theranostics, with a focus on their design, signal activation mechanism and biological applications.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspectives for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We hope that this Minireview will provide inspiration for the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Globally fitting different kinetic models of fibril formation, over a range of pHs, reveals the key microscopic molecular processes of amyloid assembly. Primary nucleation is driven by a loss of net charge, while surprisingly, both secondary nucleation and elongation rates are independent of pH.







Abstract
Central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual fibril assembly microscopic rate constants. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.

         <dc:description>
Spectral tuning, from green to red, of luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is achieved by electrolyte engineering, demonstrating that this does not require a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter. Visual mapping of luciferin's ECL enables a straightforward optical measurement of superoxide diffusivity, as described by Michelle&#8197;L. Coote, Marco Garavelli, Simone Ciampi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209670).

         <title>Selective Biocatalytic N&#8208;Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Methylated and &#8208;alkylated unsaturated heterocycles are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals that are often tedious to synthesize. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes can be used to access such molecules through alkylation with high regioselectivity, high yield and on a preparative scale using simple starting materials.







Abstract
Methods for regioselective N&#8208;methylation and &#8208;alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought&#8208;after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging N&#8208;(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents. This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &gt;99&#8201;%), yield (up to 99&#8201;%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentrations of simple starting materials.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100&#8197;years after Paul Ehrlich's vision of the &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;, the major challenges in drug delivery remain unchanged: 1)&#8197;controlling pharmacokinetic and biodistribution drug distribution and clearance in the blood; 2)&#8197;solubilizing hydrophobic agents, and 3)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. This Review describes new alternatives for synthetic drug delivery systems for systemic applications.







Abstract
Poor water solubility and low bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction in the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small&#8208;molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i)&#8197;controlling drug distribution and clearance in the blood; (ii)&#8197;solubilizing poorly water&#8208;soluble agents, and (iii)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several polymer&#8208;based systems have addressed the first two demands and have been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This Review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new polymer&#8208;based delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.

     alt="Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 100&#8197;years after Paul Ehrlich's vision of the &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;, the major challenges in drug delivery remain unchanged: 1)&#8197;controlling pharmacokinetic and biodistribution drug distribution and clearance in the blood; 2)&#8197;solubilizing hydrophobic agents, and 3)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. This Review describes new alternatives for synthetic drug delivery systems for systemic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor water solubility and low bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction in the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small-molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i)&#8197;controlling drug distribution and clearance in the blood; (ii)&#8197;solubilizing poorly water-soluble agents, and (iii)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several polymer-based systems have addressed the first two demands and have been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This Review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new polymer-based delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Atomic Pairs with a Distal Fe3+&#8208;Site Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co&#8722;Fe hetero&#8208;atomic pair, bound to a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Lewis acidic Fe center as the distal to the surface, boosted water oxidation. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulated the order of hydroxide transfer. The system offers insights into bimetallic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic systems and provides a model of in situ/operando investigations on the mechanistic understanding as well as future catalysts design.







Abstract
The hetero&#8208;atomic interaction has been the subject of many investigations, due to their heterogeneity, the individual roles of the atoms are still difficult to realize. Herein, an electrocatalyst with a hetero&#8208;atomic pair confined on a tungsten phosphide (WP) substrate so that the Fe3+&#8208;site of the pair is distal to the surface is shown to deliver an extremely low overpotential of 192&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and one of the highest oxygen production turnover frequencies (TOF) of 2.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mV under alkaline environment for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Operando characterization shows the Lewis acidic Fe3+ site boosts a large population of Co4+/3+ and the deprotonation of coordinated water, allowing simultaneously enhanced electron&#8208;transfer as well as the proton&#8208;transfer. A significant contribution from the WP substrate modulates the order of hydroxide transfer in the pre&#8208;equilibrium step (PES) and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS), leading to a remarkable OER performance.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of a Library of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Like &#8220;Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail&#8221; Linked Multimers for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies
</title>

         <dc:description>
New heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized where the disaccharide modules were connected from the reducing end to the non&#8208;reducing end to mimic the structures of native polysaccharides more closely. A library of 27 such &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides was prepared, which was found to exhibit similar structure&#8208;activity relationship trends as HS hexasaccharides in the binding to fibroblast growth factor 2.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non&#8208;reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF&#8208;2) with similar structure&#8208;activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head&#8208;to&#8208;tail linked pseudo&#8208;oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.

         <title>Next Generation Opto&#8208;Jasplakinolides Enable Local Remodeling of Actin Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of actin dynamics in biology requires tools that can be controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution. A new photoresponsive and fast&#8208;relaxing jasplakinolide (neo&#8208;optojasp) allows for the stabilization of F&#8208;actin upon irradiation with blue&#8208;green light and provides excellent spatiotemporal control. neo&#8208;Optojasp can be useful to studying actin dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our lead compound, nOJ, can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440&#8211;475&#8197;nm) and rapidly returns to its inactive state through thermal relaxation. nOJ enables the reversible control of F&#8208;actin dynamics, as shown through live&#8208;cell imaging, cell migration, and cell proliferation assays. Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision. Our optical tool can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the very low acidity of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds (pKa&#8776;42.6), direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones has been achieved by using a chiral pyridoxal as the carbonyl catalyst, producing a broad variety of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (pKa&#8776;42.6) of the &#945; C&#8722;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH2 group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl &#946;&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54&#8211;84&#8201;% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee). The &#945; C&#8722;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 1022&#8197;times (from pKa&#8197;42.6 to pKa&#8197;20.1), which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.

         <title>Cyanine Dye Coupling Mediates Self&#8208;assembly of a pH Sensitive Peptide into Novel 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated Cy5 dye&#8208;peptide system reveals the formation of two novel and structurally distinct supramolecular assemblies with photo&#8208;physical characteristics of H&#8208;type dimers or tetramers, respectively. The molecular ultrastructures are triggered by the complementary interplay of mutual chromophore coupling and pH induced changes in the peptide charge pattern.







Abstract
Synthetic multichromophore systems are of great importance in artificial light harvesting devices, organic optoelectronics, tumor imaging and therapy. Here, we introduce a promising strategy for the construction of self&#8208;assembled peptide templated dye stacks based on coupling of a de novo designed pH sensitive peptide with a cyanine dye Cy5 at its N&#8208;terminus. Microscopic techniques, in particular cryogenic TEM (cryo&#8208;TEM) and cryo&#8208;electron tomography technique (cryo&#8208;ET), reveal two types of highly ordered three&#8208;dimensional assembly structures on the micrometer scale. Unbranched compact layered rods are observed at pH&#8197;7.4 and two&#8208;dimensional membrane&#8208;like assemblies at pH&#8197;3.4, both species displaying spectral features of H&#8208;aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the coupling of Cy5 moieties promotes the formation of both ultrastructures, whereas the protonation states of acidic and basic amino acid side chains dictates their ultimate three&#8208;dimensional organization.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Oligopeptides by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Radical Addition to Dehydroalanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical addition to the dehydroalanine (Dha) residue of a peptide could diversify the peptide sequence with noncanonical residues, but this strategy is currently limited by the lack of control over the stereochemistry. This work addresses this important challenge by applying chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselective radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides.







Abstract
Radical addition to dehydroalanine (Dha) represents an appealing, modular strategy to access non&#8208;canonical peptide analogues for drug discovery. Prior studies on radical addition to the Dha residue of peptides and proteins have demonstrated outstanding functional group compatibility, but the lack of stereoselectivity has limited the synthetic utility of this approach. Herein, we address this challenge by employing chiral nickel catalysts to control the stereoselectivity of radical addition to Dha on oligopeptides. The conditions accommodate a variety of primary and secondary electrophiles to introduce polyethylene glycol, biotin, halo&#8208;tag, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains to the peptide. The reaction features catalyst control to largely override substrate&#8208;based control of stereochemical outcome for modification of short peptides. We anticipate that the discovery of chiral nickel complexes that confer catalyst control will allow rapid, late&#8208;stage modification of peptides featuring nonnatural sidechains.

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tumor microenvironment, we developed a versatile sono&#8208;sensitizer/catalyst that can realize ultrasound&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal chemodynamic therapy coupled with sonodynamic therapy. The presented nanoplatform thereby provides a feasible and efficient tumor theranostic modality with remarkable outcome and biosafety.







Abstract
The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli. US irradiation induces the valence conversion from CuII to CuI catalyzing H2O2 into &#8901;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.

         <title>Expanded Sequence Space of Radical S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rSAM enzymes are known to catalyze diverse crosslink formation in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Here, we develop a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO) to reveal the untapped biosynthetic landscape of rSAM&#8208;modified RiPPs and characterize cyclophane&#8208;forming enzymes that catalyze various tyrosine/histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain crosslinks.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32&#8201;220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161&#8201;954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a metal&#8211;organic square, a robust and renewable polyhedron&#8208;based framework material is assembled with potential for CH4 purification from natural gas and CO2 capture from industrial off&#8208;gas.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8211;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH4 and N2, but captures other competing gases (e.g. C2H6, C3H8, and CO2) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C2H6/CH4, C3H8/CH4, CO2/N2, and CO2/CH4. Particularly, the separation time is &#8776;11&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C2H6/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture and &#8776;49&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the C3H8/CH4 (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1), respectively, enabling its capability for CH4 purification from light alkanes.

         <title>Sustainable Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wacker&#8208;type oxidations afford highly value&#8208;added carbonyl compounds starting from readily available olefins and using scarce and expensive palladium catalysts at high dioxygen pressures and elevated temperatures. The last few years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the development of procedures that operate under mild conditions, as discussed in this Minireview. These procedures are based on more abundant and affordable, first&#8208;row transition metals, including metal&#8208;free processes.







Abstract
The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically requires expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such a transformation is relevant for industry, as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine&#8208;chemicals, because of the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different sets of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes that avoid the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last few years, thereby paving the way for the generation of more sustainable procedures, including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this Minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes that utilize more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Hybridization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Intrinsic Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic aperture size of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is realized by embedding graphene nanoribbons into the crystal. Particularly, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; is observed for the ZIF&#8208;8, resulting in sharp H2/CO2 separation. The atomistic molecular transport mechanism is investigated with molecular dynamics simulation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are promising for gas separation membrane, but their molecular cut&#8208;off differs from that expected from its intrinsic aperture structure because of their flexibility. Herein, we introduced graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to rigidify the ZIF framework. Because the sp2 edge of the GNRs induces strong anchoring effects, the modified layer can be rigidified. Particularly, when the GNRs were embedded and distributed in the ZIF&#8208;8 layer, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; was observed, resulting in high H2/CO2 separation (H2 permeance: 5.2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;mol/m2&#8201;Pa&#8201;s, ideal selectivity: 142). The performance surpasses the upper bound of polycrystalline MOF membrane performance. In addition, the membrane can be applied to blue H2 production, as demonstrated with a simulated steam reformed gas containing H2/CO2/CH4. The separation performance was retained in the presence of water. The fundamentals of the molecular transport through the rigid ZIF&#8208;8 framework were revealed using molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Direct TEM Observation of Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Heteroatom Incorporation into a Zeolite Framework: Towards Microscopic Design of Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In zeolite YNU&#8208;2, point vacancies and titanium active sites at specific framework positions act as cooperative binding sites. Titanium&#8208;substituted YNU&#8208;2 (Ti&#8208;YNU&#8208;2) with a pre&#8208;designed titanium distribution, was synthesized from YNU&#8208;2 by vacancy&#8208;mediated heteroatom incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy enables direct imaging at atomic scale and provided precise structural information to understand the post&#8208;synthesis process.







Abstract
Incorporating hetero&#8208;metal&#8208;atom, e.g., titanium, into zeolite frameworks can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions. However, the rational design of zeolites containing titanium at specific sites is difficult because the precise atomic structure during synthesis process remained unclear. Here, a titanosilicate with predictable titanium distribution was synthesized by mediating vacancies in a defective MSE&#8208;type zeolite precursor, based on a pre&#8208;designed synthetic route including modification of vacancies followed by titanium insertion, where electron microscopy (EM) plays a key role at each step resolving the atomic structure. Point defects including vacancies in the precursor and titanium incorporated into the vacancy&#8208;related positions have been directly observed. The results provide insights into the role of point defects in zeolites towards the rational synthesis of zeolites with desired microscopic arrangement of catalytically active sites.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Performance Lithium/Sodium&#8208;Iodine Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked with Ti3C2Tx MXene was designed and adopted as the electrodes with excellent cyclic stability and rate&#8208;performances for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries application.







Abstract
The rechargeable lithium/sodium&#8208;iodine battery (Li/Na&#8208;I2) is a promising candidate for meeting the growing energy demand. Herein, a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) linked to the Ti3C2Tx MXene complex (HOF@Ti3C2Tx) has been presented for iodine loading. HOF is self&#8208;assembled by organic monomers through hydrogen bonding interactions between each monomer. It leads to numerous cavities in HOF structure, which can encapsulate iodine through various adsorptive sites and intermolecular interactions. The unique structure of complex can accelerate the nucleation of iodine, achieve fast reaction kinetics, stabilize iodide and retard the shuttle effect, thus improving the cycling stability of I2&#8208;based batteries. The I2/HOF@Ti3C2Tx exhibits large reversible capacities of 260.2 and 207.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after repeated cycling for Li&#8208;I2 and Na&#8208;I2 batteries, respectively. This work can gain insights into the HOF&#8208;related energy storage application with reversible iodine encapsulation and its related redox reaction mechanisms with Li and Na metal ions.

         <title>Surface Degradation of Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Cathode and Regulation Mechanism by Atomic Layer Deposition in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the surface mechanism on the single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode are disclosed by in situ atomic force microscopy in solid&#8208;state batteries. Via atomic layer deposition, the Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM, leading to the uniform formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase and suppression of undesired side reaction, which endows batteries with enhanced interfacial stability, durability and dynamics.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode (SC&#8208;NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe interfacial instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li3PO4 is introduced to coat SC&#8208;NCM (L&#8208;NCM), to suppress undesired side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC&#8208;NCM are investigated inside a working SSLB by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on pristine SC&#8208;NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF&#8208;rich CEI on L&#8208;NCM maintains its initial structure upon cycling, and thus endows the battery with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on&#8208;site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8211;reactivity correlation of SC&#8208;NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.

&lt;p&gt;Single-crystalline Ni-rich cathode (SC-NCM) has attracted increasing interest owing to its greater capacity retention in advanced solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs), while suffers from severe interfacial instability during cycling. Here, via atomic layer deposition, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is introduced to coat SC-NCM (L-NCM), to suppress undesired side reaction and enhance interfacial stability. The dynamic degradation and surface regulation of SC-NCM are investigated inside a working SSLB by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; atomic force microscopy (AFM). We directly observe the uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and surface defects on pristine SC-NCM particle. Remarkably, the formed amorphous LiF-rich CEI on L-NCM maintains its initial structure upon cycling, and thus endows the battery with improved cycling stability and excellent rate capability. Such on-site tracking provides deep insights into surface mechanism and structure&#8211;reactivity correlation of SC-NCM, and thus benefits the optimizations of SSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoresponsive Dissipative Macrocycles Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of fluorinated, visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable azobenzenes in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, enabled the creation of a library of macrocyclic compounds that include highly strained, metastable, and dissipative systems. These studies give a detailed insight into photoresponsive dissipative systems and the vast potential of using azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Visible light can be used to shift dynamic covalent imine assemblies out of equilibrium. We studied a fluorinated azobenzene building block that reliably undergoes geometric isomerism upon irradiation. The building block was used in combination with two different amines, ethylenediamine and R,R&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane, to create a library of imine macrocycles. Whereas the simple amine can be used to access a polymeric state and a defined bowl&#8208;shaped macrocycle, the chiral amine gives access to a rich network of macrocycles that undergo both isomerisation as well as interconversion between different macrocyclic species, thereby allowing for control over the number of monomers involved in the cyclo&#8208;oligomerization; 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy were used to study the processes.
