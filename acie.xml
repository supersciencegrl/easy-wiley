         <title>A Platform for Stop&#8208;Flow Gradient Generation to Investigate Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microswimmers show positive and negative chemotaxis behavior in a microfluidic assay. A flow&#8208;based linear gradient is generated and the flow is stopped during the chemotaxis assay using a retroactive pressure loop.







Abstract
The ability of artificial microswimmers to respond to external stimuli and the mechanistical details of their origins belong to the most disputed challenges in interdisciplinary science. Therein, the creation of chemical gradients is technically challenging, because they quickly level out due to diffusion. Inspired by pivotal stopped flow experiments in chemical kinetics, we show that microfluidics gradient generation combined with a pressure feedback loop for precisely controlling the stop of the flows, can enable us to study mechanistical details of chemotaxis of artificial Janus micromotors, based on a catalytic reaction. We find that these copper Janus particles display a chemotactic motion along the concentration gradient in both, positive and negative direction and we demonstrate the mechanical reaction of the particles to unbalanced drag forces, explaining this behaviour.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Incorporated Mussel&#8208;Inspired Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)&#8208;Based Polymer Coating Offers Improved Antibacterial Activity and Cellular Mechanoresponse Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal ion&#8208;triggered enhanced stiffness of poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based polymer coating incorporated with bioactive cobalt ions was designed. This surface coating platform not only exhibited durable and excellent antibacterial activity, but also manipulates cellular functions with enhanced mechanosensing that facilitates the cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating.







Abstract
Cobalt (CoII) ions have been an attractive candidate for the biomedical modification of orthopedic implants for decades. However, limited research has been performed into how immobilized CoII ions affect the physical properties of implant devices and how these changes regulate cellular behavior. In this study we modified biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) with terpyridine and catechol groups (PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA) to create a stable surface coating in which bioactive metal ions could be anchored, endowing the coating with improved broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as enhanced surface stiffness and cellular mechanoresponse manipulation. Strengthened by the addition of these metal ions, the coating elicited enhanced mechanosensing from adjacent cells, facilitating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating. This dual&#8208;functional PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA/Co surface coating offers a promising approach for improving clinical implantation outcomes.

         <title>In Situ Halogen&#8208;Ion Leaching Regulates Multiple Sites on Tandem Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay of dual components in tandem catalysts is uncovered and utilized during the electrochemical reconstruction for promoting CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products. Taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrain the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species, thus achieving a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts can divide the reaction into distinct steps by local multiple sites and thus are attractive to trigger CO2RR to C2+ products. However, the evolution of catalysts generally exists during CO2RR, thus a closer investigation of the reconstitution, interplay, and active origin of dual components in tandem catalysts is warranted. Here, taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, we uncovered the interaction of two phases during the electrochemical reconstruction. Multiple operando techniques unraveled that in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrained the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species during the CO2RR. This way, the residual iodine species of the Ag matrix accelerated CO generation and iodine&#8208;induced Cu0/Cu+ promotes C&#8722;C coupling. This self&#8208;adaptive dual&#8208;optimization endowed our catalysts with an excellent C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%. Material operando changes in this work offer a new approach for manipulating active species towards enhancing C2+ products.

         <title>Tuning the High&#8208;Pressure Phase Behaviour of Highly Compressible Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks: From Discontinuous to Continuous Pore Closure by Linker Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the ratio of different imidazolate linkers modulates a high&#8208;pressure open&#8208;pore to closed&#8208;pore phase transition of a series of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) from first order to second order. The second&#8208;order phase transition allows finetuning the pore structure of the framework material by regulation of the mechanical pressure.







Abstract
The high&#8208;pressure behaviour of flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) of the ZIF&#8208;62 family with the chemical composition M(im)2&#8722;x(bim)x is presented (M2+=Zn2+, Co2+; im&#8722;=imidazolate; bim&#8722;=benzimidazolate, 0.02&#8804;x&#8804;0.37). High&#8208;pressure powder X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that the materials contract reversibly from an open pore (op) to a closed pore (cp) phase under a hydrostatic pressure of up to 4000&#8197;bar. Sequentially increasing the bim&#8722; fraction (x) reinforces the framework, leading to an increased threshold pressure for the op&#8208;to&#8208;cp phase transition, while the total volume contraction across the transition decreases. Most importantly, the typical discontinuous op&#8208;to&#8208;cp transition (first order) changes to an unusual continuous transition (second order) for x&#8805;0.35. This allows finetuning of the void volume and the pore size of the material continuously by adjusting the pressure, thus opening new possibilities for MOFs in pressure&#8208;switchable devices, membranes, and actuators.

         <title>Micromechanically&#8208;Powered Rolling Locomotion of a Twisted&#8208;Crystal Optical&#8208;Waveguide Cavity as a Mobile Light Polarization Rotor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted organic crystals display rolling locomotion on a flat substrate when subjected to mechanical force using an atomic force microscope cantilever tip. These crystals are flexible and efficiently self&#8208;guide the fluorescence both in straight and bent geometries and act as optical cavities.

We demonstrate mechanically&#8208;powered rolling locomotion of a twisted&#8208;microcrystal optical&#8208;waveguide cavity on the substrate, rotating the output signal's linear&#8208;polarization. Self&#8208;assembly of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;(((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenol produces naturally twisted microcrystals. The strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres dictates the pitch lengths of the twisted crystals. The crystals are flexible, perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries guide fluorescence along their body axes and display optical modes. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal&#8208;waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the output signal polarization. The presented twisted&#8208;crystal cavity with a combination of mechanical locomotion and photonic attributes unfolds a new dimension in mechanophotonics.

&lt;p&gt;Twisted organic crystals display rolling locomotion on a flat substrate when subjected to mechanical force using an atomic force microscope cantilever tip. These crystals are flexible and efficiently self-guide the fluorescence both in straight and bent geometries and act as optical cavities. Remarkably, twisted-crystal waveguides rotate the guided polarized optical modes direction as a function of the crystal's rolling motion.

         <title>Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]: A Heteroanionic Nonlinear Optical Material Containing Planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and Heteroleptic [SnOSe3] Anionic Groups</title>

         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic nonlinear optical material, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] has been synthesized. Its structure contains two different kinds of anionic groups: planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and heteroleptic [SnOSe3]. It exhibits promising properties including a large second harmonic generation (SHG) response (ca. 1&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap (Eg) of 3.46&#8197;eV, a high laser damage threshold (LDT) of 240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as a wide transparent region.







Abstract
Inorganic heteroanionic materials are attracting increasing attention for exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because they could better satisfy the necessary but conflicting properties of NLO crystals, e.g. large SHG response and wide band&#8208;gap. Up to now, the reports on heteroanionic NLO materials have mainly focused on ultraviolet or visible oxide&#8208;based fluoroborates, fluorophosphates, borate&#8208;phosphates and borate&#8208;iodates. However, chalcogenides containing different kinds of anionic groups have barely been reported. Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide&#8208;carbonate, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe3] and [CO3]. It crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including a large SHG response (&#8776;1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064&#8197;nm), wide band&#8208;gap (3.46&#8197;eV) and high laser damage threshold (240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These make Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] a promising NLO crystal.

         <title>Enhancing Enzyme Activity by the Modulation of Covalent Interactions in the Confined Channels of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were utilized for the covalent immobilization of cytochrome c (Cyt c), offering protection for the Cyt c. The covalent interactions could induce the conformation changes of Cyt c giving a more accessible active site, and consequently enhanced activity.







Abstract
Controllable regulations on the enzyme conformation to optimize catalytic performance are highly desired for the immobilized biocatalysts yet remain challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess confined channels with finely tunable pore environment, offering a promising platform for enzyme encapsulation. Herein, we covalently immobilized the cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the size&#8208;matched channels of COFs with different contents of anchoring site, and significant enhancement of the stability and activity (&#8776;600&#8201;% relative activity compared with free enzyme) can be realized by optimizing the covalent interactions. Structural analyses on the immobilized Cyt c suggest that covalent bonding could induce conformational perturbation resulting in more accessible active sites. The effectiveness of the covalent interaction modulation together with the tailorable confined channels of COFs offers promise to develop high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.

         <title>Structural Insight of MOFs under Combined Mechanical and Adsorption Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new in situ pressure cell was designed that can follow materials under two combined stimuli: gas pressure and mechanical stress, providing structural insight into phase transformations of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The cell was used to gain direct evidence that mechanical stress can control MIL&#8208;53(Al) breathing behaviour with CO2, further paving the way for dynamic tuning of separation performance for compliant MOFs.







Abstract
External control over the pore size of flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently emerged as an intriguing concept, with possible applications to gas storage and separation. In this work we present a new pressure cell capable for the first time of monitoring through in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction an adsorbent powder under combined uniaxial applied mechanical stress (up to 1&#8197;GPa) and gas pressure (up to 20&#8197;bar). The combined stress&#8211;pressure clamp (CSPC) cell was successfully exploited to follow the evolution of the CO2 breathing behaviour of the prototypical complex breathing MIL&#8208;53(Al) system under mechanical compression obtaining structural evidence that this MOF can be maintained in its closed pore state upon compression, precluding its re&#8208;opening at high gas pressure (&gt;7&#8197;bar). This novel setup shows potential for the in&#8208;operando exploration of flexible systems, in equilibrium and flow configurations.

         <title>Aqueous Biphasic Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photosynthesis Cells for TEMPO&#8208;Based Oxidation of Glycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell for glycerol oxidation while producing H2 is presented. The redox&#8208;gel protects the photoanode from aqueous reaction conditions. The gel layer contained 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl and shuttles electrons between the photoexcited dye and glycerol at the biphasic interface. Employment of the redox&#8208;gel showed a 10&#8208;fold increase in glyceraldehyde production compared to the fully aqueous system.







Abstract
This work reports an aqueous dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) capable of oxidizing glycerol (an archetypical biobased compound) coupled with H2 production. We employed a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode sensitized with the high potential thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, encased in an acetonitrile&#8208;based redox&#8208;gel that protects the photoanode from degradation by aqueous electrolytes. The use of the gel creates a biphasic system with an interface at the organic (gel) electrode and aqueous anolyte. Embedded in the acetonitrile gel is 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), acting as both a redox&#8208;mediator and a catalyst for oxidative transformations. Upon oxidation of TEMPO by the photoexcited dye, the in situ generated TEMPO+ shuttles through the gel to the acetonitrile&#8211;aqueous interface, where it acts as an oxidant for the selective conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde. The introduction of the redox&#8208;gel layer affords a 10&#8208;fold increase in the conversion of glycerol compared to the purely aqueous system. Our redox&#8208;gel protected photoanode yielded a stable photocurrent over 48&#8197;hours of continuous operation, demonstrating that this DSPEC is compatible with alkaline aqueous reactions.

The introduction of the redox-gel layer affords a 10-fold increase in the conversion of glycerol compared to the purely aqueous system. Our redox-gel protected photoanode yielded a stable photocurrent over 48&#8197;hours of continuous operation, demonstrating that this DSPEC is compatible with alkaline aqueous reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Molecules: Unveiling the Valence Tautomerism Phenomena in Bare Barbaralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two valence tautomers have been revealed in the supersonic expansion for an archetypal fluxional molecule phenyl&#8208;barbaralone, providing definite experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement in these shape&#8208;shifting systems.







Abstract
We report a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic study of an archetypical barbaralone, conclusively revealing the valence tautomerism phenomena for this bistable molecular system. The two distinct 1&#8208; and 5&#8208;substituted valence tautomers have been isolated in a supersonic expansion for the first time and successfully characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy. This work provides irrefutable experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement in barbaralones and highlights the use of rotational spectroscopy to analyze shape&#8208;shifting mixtures. Moreover, this observation opens the window toward the characterization of new fluxional systems in the isolation conditions of the gas phase and should serve as a reference point in the general understanding of valence tautomerism.

         <title>Molecular Catalysts for the Reductive Homocoupling of CO2 towards C2+ Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent progress in molecular catalysis of CO2 and CO homocoupling through thermochemical and electrochemical reductive approaches. Particular attention is paid to C&#8722;C coupling processes that generate multicarbon products. The current challenges in this rapidly growing field are described and perspectives for possible future developments are outlined.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) compounds by reductive homocoupling offers the possibility to transform renewable energy into chemical energy carriers and thereby create &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; fuels or other valuable products. Most available studies have employed heterogeneous metallic catalysts, but the use of molecular catalysts is still underexplored. However, several studies have already demonstrated the great potential of the molecular approach, namely, the possibility to gain a deep mechanistic understanding and a more precise control of the product selectivity. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in both the thermo&#8208; and electrochemical reductive homocoupling of CO2 toward C2+ products mediated by molecular catalysts. In addition, reductive CO homocoupling is discussed as a model for the further conversion of intermediates obtained from CO2 reduction, which may serve as a source of inspiration for developing novel molecular catalysts in the future.

         <title>Studying the Key Intermediate of RNA Autohydrolysis by Cryogenic Gas&#8208;Phase Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA autohydrolysis is a generic phenomenon in solution and proceeds via a 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic nucleotide intermediate. Cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations show that the structure of c&#8208;fragments generated by the dissociation of RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase is equal to the key intermediate of RNA autohydrolysis. Furthermore, the data show that the nucleobase in cytidine phosphate readily tautomerizes in the gas phase.







Abstract
Over the course of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, mRNA&#8208;based vaccines have gained tremendous importance. The development and analysis of modified RNA molecules benefit from advanced mass spectrometry and require sufficient understanding of fragmentation processes. Analogous to the degradation of RNA in solution by autohydrolysis, backbone cleavage of RNA strands was equally observed in the gas phase; however, the fragmentation mechanism remained elusive. In this work, autohydrolysis&#8208;like intermediates were generated from isolated RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase and investigated using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets. Data from both experiment and density functional theory provide evidence for the formation of a five&#8208;membered cyclic phosphate intermediate and rule out linear or six&#8208;membered structures. Furthermore, the experiments show that another prominent condensed&#8208;phase reaction of RNA nucleotides can be induced in the gas phase: the tautomerization of cytosine. Both observed reactions are therefore highly universal and intrinsic properties of the investigated molecules.

         <title>Generation and Release of OH Radicals from the Reaction of H2O with O2 over Soot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by the reaction of H2O with O2 over soot was revealed, which indicates the airborne soot particles generated by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons may entail important catalytic oxidation capacity.







Abstract
OH radicals in the air maintain the oxidizing power of the troposphere. A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals, thereby lowering the oxidizing power of atmosphere in the event of high&#8208;level PM. By contrary, our joint experimental/theoretical study reveals a new mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by carbonaceous soot particles. We show that water and O2 react on carbonaceous surfaces and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. With ample delocalized &#960; electrons, carbonaceous surfaces enable the easy desorption of hydroxyl groups to produce gaseous OH radicals, evidenced by direct observation of the steady generation of OH radicals on a carbonaceous surface. Our results reveal a new chemical mechanism for the production of OH radicals.

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of Secondary and Tertiary Fluorides from &#946;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Ketoacids**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of secondary and tertiary fluorides is performed by the pyruvate aldolase HpcH and its engineered variants, utilizing &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids as non&#8208;native donor substrates. Rationalization of beneficial mutations and optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the chemoenzymatic preparation of fluorinated synthons with relevance to bioactive natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Fluorine is a critical element for the design of bioactive compounds, driving advances in selective and sustainable fluorination. However, stereogenic tertiary fluorides pose a synthetic challenge and are thus present in only a few approved drugs (fluticasone, solithromycin, and sofosbuvir). The aldol reaction of fluorinated donors provides an atom&#8208;economical approach to asymmetric C&#8722;F motifs via C&#8722;C bond formation. We report that the type II pyruvate aldolase HpcH and engineered variants perform addition of &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids (including fluoropyruvate, &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketobutyrate, and &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketovalerate) to diverse aldehydes. The reactivity of HpcH towards these fluoro&#8208;donors grants access to enantiopure secondary or tertiary fluorides. In addition to representing the first synthesis of tertiary fluorides via biocatalytic carboligation, the afforded products could improve the diversity of fluorinated building blocks and enable the synthesis of fluorinated drug analogs.

         <title>A Bacteria&#8208;Responsive Porphyrin for Adaptable Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TMPyP) that can respond to specific bacteria, followed by adaptable photodynamic/photothermal therapy processes. TMPyP could be reduced to phlorin by facultative anaerobes with a strong reducing ability such as  E. coli  and  S. typhimurium  in hypoxic environments, possessing strong NIR absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity, thus demonstrating excellent antimicrobial activity (&gt; 99%) by photothermal therapy. While in an aerobic environment with aerobic bacteria, TMPyP functioned as a typical photosensitizer that killed bacteria effectively (&gt; 99.9%) by photodynamic therapy. By forming a host&#8208;guest complex with cucurbit[7]uril, the biocompatibility of TMPyP significantly improved. This kind of bacteria&#8208;responsive porphyrin shows specificity and adaptivity in antimicrobial treatment and holds potential in non&#8208;invasive treatments of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Molecular Nitrogen Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Liquid Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation is industrially realized by mass production of ammonia, the principal intermediate nitrogen source for N&#8208;containing organic molecules. Instead, direct C&#8208;N bond formation from dinitrogen (N  2  ) is of great interest but remains a grand challenge. Here, by virtue of unique plasma&#8208;liquid interactions, we developed an environmentally benign one&#8208;pot approach to directly coupling benzene and N  2  , two naturally abundant yet chemically inert molecules, into value&#8208;added arylamines. Under the optimal conditions, an amination yield of 45% was rapidly achieved, far better than the reported benzene amination efficiency using ammonia. A tentative reaction mechanism was proposed involving the long&#8208;lived N  2  (A  3  &#931;  u  +  )&#160;and N  2  +  species, as evidenced by the key intermediates detected. With a deeper mechanistic understanding and by further optimizing plasma reactor, it is promising to realize cost&#8208;effective electrical amination of benzene with N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Ratiometric Emission to Differentiate Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular weight has an important bearing on the properties of supramolecular polymers. However, the intuitive differentiation for the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers remains challenging. Given this situation, establishing a reliable relationship between fluorescence properties and molecular weight may be a promising strategy. Herein, we prepared a supramolecular monomer  M1  with aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission characteristics. With the increasing  M1  concentration (0.100 &#8208; 100 mM), the average degree of polymerization (DP  DOSY  ) rose from 1.00 to 293. Meanwhile, the color changed from dark blue to cyan, finally to yellow&#8208;green in the same concentration range. Hence, the intuitive relationship between DP  DOSY  and fluorescence colors was constructed, allowing the visual differentiation of molecular weight. Moreover, the fluorescence color could be regulated by introducing competitive molecule to induce the depolymerization of supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic Conjugated Polymer Nanoarchitectonics with Synergistic Redox&#8208;active Sites for High&#8208;performance Aluminium Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of cost&#8208;effective and long&#8208;life rechargeable aluminium ion batteries (AIBs) shows promising prospects for sustainable energy storage applications. Here, we report a heteroatom &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer featuring synergistic C=O and C=N active centres as a new cathode material in AIBs using a low&#8208;cost AlCl  3  /urea electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the fused C=N sites in polymer not only benefit good &#960;&#8208;conjugation but also enhance the redox reactivity of C=O sites, which enables the polymer to accommodate four AlCl  2  (urea)  2  +  per repeating unit. By integrating the polymer with carbon nanotubes, the hybrid cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity and a long cycle life (295 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  and 85 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 1 A g  &#8208;1  over 4000 cycles). The achieved specific energy density of 413 Wh kg  &#8208;1  outperforms most Al&#8208;organic batteries reported to date. The synergistic redoxactive sites strategy sheds light on the rational design of organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Kilogram&#8208;Scale Preparation of Highly Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of crystalline porous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is essential to realize their broad industrial applications but remains a great challenge, which requires the fundamental understanding of the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization mechanism. Herein, we report a universal polyphosphoric acid (H  6  P  4  O  13  )&#8208;catalyzed nitrile trimerization route to synthesize a series of highly crystalline CTFs with high specific surface areas. This new strategy enables the cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale fabrication of crystalline CTFs at kilogram level for the first time. Through density functional theory calculation and detailed controlled experiments, we reveal that the polyphosphate acid show much higher catalytic activity for trimerization reaction than its analogues such as P  2  O  5  and H  3  PO  4  . Furthermore, the crystalline CTFs with regular porosity and abundant triazine groups exhibit ultrahigh removal efficiency of micropollutants, indicating its great potential in environment remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Affinity Purification of Long&#8208;Acting PASylated Proteins with Therapeutic Potential Using L&#8208;Prolinamide for Mild Elution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both insufficient plasma half&#8208;life (circulation for only few hours or less) and laborious downstream purification can be bottlenecks for biological drug development. We report a novel strategy for the efficient and gentle affinity purification of pharmacologically relevant proteins modified by PASylation for prolonged action&#160;  in vivo  . We previously described antibodies specific for Pro/Ala&#8208;rich sequences (PAS) covering a range of binding characteristics. Our approach relies on a chromatography matrix functionalized with a low&#8208;affinity PAS&#8208;specific antibody Fab fragment for specific adsorption of the PASylated protein from a macromolecular mixture. With the complete absence of hydrophobic/aromatic or ionic groups in the PAS sequence epitope, binding is mediated by Van der Waals contacts and distinct hydrogen bonds only. Surprisingly, selective competitive elution is achieved by application of the highly soluble and biologically inactive imino acid derivative L&#8208;prolinamide. Based on the specific but strongly dynamic biomolecular interaction, our procedure allows the direct one&#8208;step purification of PASylated proteins from a cell extract or culture supernatant while avoiding harsh elution conditions as they are often needed for conventional affinity chromatography.</dc:description>

A notable difference between the atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of the hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen, resulting in the formation of a B&#8208;rich surface and an Al&#8208;rich bulk.







Abstract
Chemical modification of electrode materials by heteroatom dopants is crucial for improving storage performance in rechargeable batteries. Electron configurations of different dopants significantly influence the chemical interactions inbetween and the chemical bonding with the host material, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We revealed competitive doping chemistry of Group IIIA elements (boron and aluminum) taking nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials as a model. A notable difference between the atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of the hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen. Density functional theory calculations reveal, Al is preferentially bonded to oxygen and vice versa, and shows a much lower diffusion barrier than BIII. In the case of Al&#8208;preoccupation, the bulk diffusion of BIII is hindered. In this way, a B&#8208;rich surface and Al&#8208;rich bulk is formed, which helps to synergistically stabilize the structural evolution and surface chemistry of the cathode.

         <title>Single Stabilizing Point Mutation Enables High&#8208;Resolution Co&#8208;Crystal Structures of the Adenosine A2A Receptor with Preladenant Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;stable adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) containing a single point mutation in the transmembrane regions was developed by imitating an allosteric Na+ through introduction of a basic amino acid residue. This allowed the determination of high&#8208;resolution co&#8208;crystal structures with newly designed PEGylated and fluorophore&#8208;labeled Preladenant derivatives, which belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists endowed with outstanding selectivity.







Abstract
The G protein&#8208;coupled adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) is an important new (potential) drug target in immuno&#8208;oncology, and for neurodegenerative diseases. Preladenant and its derivatives belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists displaying exceptional selectivity. While crystal structures of the human A2AAR have been solved, mostly using the A2A&#8208;StaR2 protein that bears 9 point mutations, co&#8208;crystallization with Preladenant derivatives has so far been elusive. We developed a new A2AAR construct harboring a single point mutation (S913.39K) which renders it extremely thermostable. This allowed the co&#8208;crystallization of two novel Preladenant derivatives, the polyethylene glycol&#8208;conjugated (PEGylated) PSB&#8208;2113, and the fluorophore&#8208;labeled PSB&#8208;2115. The obtained crystal structures (2.25&#8197;&#197; and 2.6&#8197;&#197; resolution) provide explanations for the high potency and selectivity of Preladenant derivatives. They represent the first crystal structures of a GPCR in complex with PEG&#8208; and fluorophore&#8208;conjugated ligands. The applied strategy is predicted to be applicable to further class A GPCRs.

         <title>Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclizations by Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsule Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular capsules enable the conversion of substrates inside a closed cavity, mimicking to some extent enzymatic catalysis. Chirality transfer from the molecular capsule onto the encapsulated substrate has been only studied in a few cases. Here we demonstrate that chirality transfer is possible inside a rather large molecular container of approximately 1400 &#197;  3  . Specifically, we present (1) the first examples of optically active hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules, (2) their ability to enantioselectively catalyze tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclizations, and (3) the surprisingly high sensitivity of enantioselectivity on the structural modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dienyl and Allyl Esters from Propargyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent catalysis is a vital chemical tool that allows efficient access to large collections of structurally diverse molecules from a common precursor but remains a challenge. We reported a catalyst&#8208;controlled, tunable, and predictable regiodivergency in transforming the internal aliphatic propargyl esters into diverse libraries of highly substituted 1,3&#8208;dienyl and allyl products by Pd&#8208;catalysis. Depending on the ligand employed, palladium catalyst can involve two typical approaches: electrophilic palladium catalysis and sequential oxidation additive&#8208;reductive elimination pathway. This regiodivergent protocol endows facile access to four regioisomers with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity from the common propargyl esters. In terms of synthetic utility, a notable feature of this protocol is amenable to structural diversification of bioactive relevant molecules, enabling rapid assembly of many useful structural analogs of pharmaceutical candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Changes of an Aromatic Amine Photoacid along the F&#246;rster Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids show a strong increase in acidity in the first electronic excited state, enabling real&#8208;time studies of proton transfer in acid&#8208;base reactions, proton transport in energy storage devices and biomolecular sensor protein systems. Several explanations have been proposed for what determines photoacidity, ranging from variations in solvation free energy to changes in electronic structure occurring along the four stages of the F&#246;rster cycle. Here we use picosecond nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy to monitor the electronic structure changes of the proton donating group in a protonated aromatic amine photoacid in solution upon photoexcitation and subsequent proton transfer dynamics. Probing core&#8208;to&#8208;valence transitions locally at the amine functional group and with orbital specificity, we clearly reveal pronounced electronic structure, dipole moment and energetic changes on the conjugate photobase side. This result paves the way for a detailed electronic structural characterization of the photoacidity phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By limiting the nitrogen source to glutamic acid, we isolated cyclic peptides from  Euglena gracilis  containing asparagine and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids. Structure elucidation was accomplished through spectroscopic methods, mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. The euglenatides potently inhibit pathogenic fungi and cancer cell lines e.g., euglenatide B exhibiting IC  50  values of 4.3 mM in ketoconazole resistant  Aspergillus  fumigatus  and 0.29 mM in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. In an unprecedented convergence of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis between unicellular species and the metazoan kingdom, euglenatides bear resemblance to nemamides from  Caenorhabditis elegans  and inhibited both producing organisms  E. gracilis  and  C. elegans  . By molecular network analysis, we detected over forty euglenatide&#8208;like metabolites in  E. gracilis  ,  E. sanguinea  and  E. mutabilis  , suggesting an important biological role for these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Based Linear Nonalternant Nanoribbons with Bright Emission and Ambipolar Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly soluble linear non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons (NNR&#8208;1 to NNR&#8208;4) featuring pentagonal rings peri&#8208;fused onto repeating perylene units have been synthesized by a stepwise approach. The NNRs adopt a twisted nanoribbon structure and exhibit large molar extinction coefficients (up to 400860&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), high absolute quantum efficiencies (up to 82&#8201;%), and narrowed energy gaps (down to &#8776;1.7&#8197;eV) as well as excellent redox properties.







Abstract
Here we report stepwise solution&#8208;synthesis of linear nonalternant nanoribbons (NNRs), featuring pentagonal rings peri&#8208;fused onto the repeating perylene unit. The X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures demonstrated their &#960;&#8208;backbones as a twisted ribbon, with the longest crystalline length of the nanoribbon up to 3.9&#8197;nm. NNRs exhibited an orange to deep&#8208;red photoluminescence even under the room light, with absolute &#934;F up to 82&#8201;%, most likely due to ring&#8208;strain induced molecular stiffness. Benefiting from the enlarged size and the antiaromatic character of pentagons, all of NNRs possessed ambipolar redox properties, especially for longer nanoribbons showing multiple reversible reductions and oxidations. In addition, experimental and theoretical results indicated a ground state open&#8208;shell singlet diradicaloid for the dication of longer NNRs. Our studies reveal the intriguing nonalternant structures and physical properties of this type of nanoribbons, involving the striking effects of the multiple annulated pentagons, and also provide fundamental insights into their electronic structures.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Confined Indium Oxides for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction in a Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Flow Cell</title>

A robust carbon&#8208;covered indium oxide electrocatalyst demonstrates an enhanced and stable activity for the direct production of formic acid in a solid&#8208;state carbon dioxide electrolyzer.







Abstract
Developing robust electrocatalysts and advanced devices is important for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction toward the generation of valuable chemicals. We present herein a carbon&#8208;confined indium oxide electrocatalyst for stable and efficient CO2 reduction. The reductive corrosion of oxidative indium to the metallic state during electrolysis could be prevented by carbon protection, and the applied carbon layer also optimizes the reaction intermediate adsorption, which enables both high selectivity and activity for CO2 reduction. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, the formate selectivity exceeds 90&#8201;% in a wide potential window from &#8722;0.8&#8197;V to &#8722;1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE. The continuous production of ca. 0.12&#8197;M pure formic acid solution is further demonstrated at a current density of 30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte mediated reactor. This work provides significant concepts in the parallel development of electrocatalysts and devices for carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.

         <title>Engineering Highly Reduced Molybdenum Polyoxometalates via the Incorporation of d and f Block Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel types of highly reduced Mo polyoxometalates, the {Mo64} cube and {Mo70} star, are obtained through near&#8208;hydrothermal conditions with incorporations of nickel and lanthanide ions and possess a set of building blocks different to those present in Mo blues and browns. With a few of other rare structures, this group of polyoxomolybdates is redefined as Mo reds based on the major differences in building blocks and reduction degrees.







Abstract
The assembly of nanoscale polyoxometalate (POM) clusters has been dominated by the highly reduced icosahedral {Mo132} &#8220;browns&#8221; and the toroidal {Mo154} &#8220;blues&#8221; which are 45&#8201;% and 18&#8201;% reduced, respectively. We hypothesised that there is space for a greater diversity of structures in this immediate reduction zone. Here we show it is possible to make highly reduced mix&#8208;valence POMs by presenting new classes of polyoxomolybdates: [MoV52MoVI12H26O200]42&#8722; {Mo64} and [MoV40MoVI30H30O215]20&#8722; {Mo70}, 81&#8201;% and 57&#8201;% reduced, respectively. The {Mo64} cluster archetype has a super&#8208;cube structure and is composed of five different types of building blocks, each arranged in overlayed Archimedean or Platonic polyhedra. The {Mo70} cluster comprises five tripodal {MoV6} and five tetrahedral {MoV2MoVI2} building blocks alternatively linked to form a loop with a pentagonal star topology. We also show how the reaction yielding the {Mo64} super&#8208;cube can be used in the enrichment of lanthanides which exploit the differences in selectivity in the self&#8208;assembly of the polyoxometalates.

         <title>Enantioselective Seleno&#8208;Michael Addition Reactions Catalyzed by a Chiral Bifunctional N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene with Noncovalent Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Michael reaction is a conjugate addition and is one of the most powerful methods with which to prepare functional molecules with a &#946;&#8208;stereogenic center. Despite its success in the formation of various asymmetric carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, enantioselective seleno&#8208;Michael addition remains essentially unexplored. We report here a highly enantioselective Michael addition reaction of alkyl selenols to enones. This method conveniently introduces a Se atom to an electron&#8208;deficient double bond asymmetrically. A chiral bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/thiourea catalyst was developed as a key ingredient that delivers chiral &#946;&#8208;seleno ketones with remarkable selectivity. This new catalyst and its mode of action support broad applications in the catalytic activation of nucleophilic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Characterization and Theoretical Calculations Identify Partially Reduced ZnO1&#8208;x/Cu Interfaces for Methanol Synthesis from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active site of the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al  2  O  3  catalyst used in CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol has been debated for decades. Grand challenges remain in the characterization of structure, composition, and chemical state, both microscopically and spectroscopically, and complete theoretical calculations are limited when it comes to describing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst over the diverse range of structures that emerge under realistic conditions. Here a series of inverse model catalysts of ZnO on copper hydroxide were prepared where the size of ZnO was precisely tuned from atomically dispersed species to nanoparticles using atomic layer deposition. ZnO decoration boosted methanol formation to a rate of 877 g  MeOH  kg  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  with ~80% selectivity at 493 K. High pressure in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the atomically dispersed ZnO species are prone to aggregate at oxygen&#8208;deficient ZnO ensembles instead of forming CuZn metal alloys. By modeling various potential active structures, density functional theory calculations and microkinetic simulations revealed that ZnO/Cu interfaces with oxygen vacancies, rather than stoichiometric interfaces, were essential to catalytic activation.</dc:description>

Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR&#8208;G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylamino&#8208;1&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine, with a 4193&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2 &#8451; improvement in Tm, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78% (R) to &gt;99% (R). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram&#8208;scale under industrially relevant conditions.

         <dc:description>A clear understanding of the acidic properties of bridging Si&#8208;OH&#8208;Al groups containing crystallographically different oxygen atoms in zeolites is a prerequisite for optimizing their performance as industrial solid catalysts and developing new acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, but presents many challenges.

         <title>Small Molecules Modulate Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transitions in Phase&#8208;separated Tau Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Tau protein condensates formed by the Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) process, liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions lead to the formation of fibrils implicated in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Here, by tracking two contacting Tau&#8208;rich droplets using a simple and nonintrusive video microscopy, we found that the halftime of the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition in the Tau condensate is affected by the Hofmeister series according to the solvation energy of anions. After dissecting functional groups of physiologically relevant small molecules using a multivariate approach, we found that charged groups facilitate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition in a manner similar to the Hofmeister effect whereas hydrophobic alkyl chains and aromatic rings inhibit the transition. Our results not only elucidate the driving force of the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition in Tau condensates, but also provide guidelines to design small molecules to modulate this important transition for many biological functions for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual pH&#8208; and Light&#8208;Responsive Spiropyrane&#8208;Based Surfactant: Investigations on Its Switching Behavior and Remote Control over Emulsion Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyrane&#8208;based cationic surfactant is presented. Its architecture renders the molecule dual&#8208;responsive, possessing thereby an unexpected switching behaviour: While photo&#8208;stimulation influences the surface&#8208;active behaviour of the compound under acidified conditions, no notable photo&#8208;responsiveness is observed at pH&#8208;values &gt;6.5. This effect is demonstrated by manipulating the integrity of an oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion.







Abstract
A cationic surfactant containing a spiropyrane unit is prepared exhibiting a dual&#8208;responsive adjustability of its surface&#8208;active characteristics. The switching mechanism of the system relies on the reversible conversion of the non&#8208;ionic spiropyrane (SP) to a zwitterionic merocyanine (MC) and can be controlled by adjusting the pH value and via light, resulting in a pH&#8208;dependent photoactivity: While the compound possesses a pronounced difference in surface activity between both forms under acidic conditions, this behavior is suppressed at a neutral pH level. The underlying switching processes are investigated in detail, and a thermodynamic explanation based on a combination of theoretical and experimental results is provided. This complex stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior enables remote&#8208;control of colloidal systems. To demonstrate its applicability, the surfactant is utilized for the pH&#8208;dependent manipulation of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions.

Its architecture renders the molecule dual-responsive, possessing thereby an unexpected switching behaviour: While photo-stimulation influences the surface-active behaviour of the compound under acidified conditions, no notable photo-responsiveness is observed at pH-values &amp;gt;6.5. This effect is demonstrated by manipulating the integrity of an oil-in-water emulsion.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase involves synthesis of a CO, CN&#8208;, and dithiomethylamine (DTMA)&#8208;coordinated 2Fe subcluster that is inserted into HydA to make the active hydrogenase. This process requires three maturation enzymes: the radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzymes HydE and HydG, and the GTPase HydF. In vitro maturation with purified maturation enzymes has been possible only when clarified cell lysate was added, with the lysate presumably providing essential components for DTMA synthesis and delivery. Here we report maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase using a fully defined system that includes components of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), but no cell lysate. Our results reveal for the first time an essential role for the aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein of the GCS in hydrogenase maturation and the synthesis of the DTMA ligand of the H&#8208;cluster. In addition, we show that ammonia is the source of the bridgehead nitrogen of DTMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Synthesis Enabled Sulfur Atom Strategy for Polymerization&#8208;Enhanced and Two&#8208;Photon Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8211;yne click reaction facilely afforded photosensitizers by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing. Combined with aggregation&#8208;induced emission and polymerization effects, excellent photosensitizers can be obtained for two&#8208;photon excited photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Facile tailoring of photosensitizers (PSs) with advanced and synergetic properties is highly expected to broaden and deepen photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;free thiol&#8211;yne click reaction was employed to develop the sulfur atom&#8208;based PSs by using the in situ formed sulfur &#8220;heavy atom effect&#8221; to enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC), while such an effect can be remarkably magnified by the polymerization. The introduction of a tetraphenylpyrazine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) unit was also advantageous in PS design by suppressing their non&#8208;radiative decay to facilitate the ISC in the aggregated state. Besides, the resulting sulfur atom electron donor, together with a double&#8208;bond &#960; bridge and AIE electron acceptor, created a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecular system with good two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Combined with the high singlet oxygen generation efficiency, the fabricated polymer nanoparticles exhibited an excellent in vitro two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited PDT towards cancer cells, therefore possessing a huge potential for the deep&#8208;tissue disease therapy.

         <title>Entropy Enhanced Perovskite Oxide Ceramic for Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of Oxygen to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy perovskite oxide ceramic Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)1/6O3 electrocatalyst has been synthesized on a kilogram&#8208;scale via the thermal&#8208;induced solid solution method that delivers efficient H2O2 production by an oxygen reduction reaction and spontaneously degrades organic dyes through the Fenton reaction.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a most promising and efficient route to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the lack of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts have restricted its practical application. Herein, an entropy&#8208;enhancement strategy has been employed to enable the low&#8208;cost perovskite oxide to effectively catalyze the electrosynthesis of H2O2. The optimized Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)1/6O3 ceramic is available on a kilogram&#8208;scale and displays commendable ORR activity in alkaline media with high selectivity over 91&#8201;% across the wide potential range for H2O2 including an outstanding degradation property for organic dyes through the Fenton process. The exceptional performance of this perovskite oxide is attributed to the entropy stabilization&#8208;induced polymorphic transformation assuring the robust structural stability, decreased charge mobility as well as synergistic catalytic effects which we confirm using advanced in situ Raman, transient photovoltage, Rietveld refinement as well as finite elemental analysis.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Borylation of Pyridines with Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of a wide range of pyridines using pinacolborane was achieved through yttrium catalysis. Notably, the possible hydroboration side reaction was effectively suppressed by using the proper ligand/metal combination. The resultant 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates were subjected to further transformations such as a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling or the Chan&#8211;Lam amination.







Abstract
This work reports a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of pyridines at the ortho&#8208;position with pinacolborane enabled by an yttrocene catalyst. The reaction provides a new family of 2&#8208;pyridyl boronates with a broad substrate scope and high atom efficiency. The resultant boronates were able to undergo a variety of transformations, e.g., oxidation, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, Chan&#8211;Lam amination and etherification. Catalytic intermediates, including ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H metalated and borylated complexes, were isolated from stoichiometric experiments and confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Peptide Backbone Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Merocyanine Oligomers into Duplex Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of peptide backbone connected merocyanine oligomers leads to the formation of DNA&#8208;like duplex structures containing two, four, and six chromophores. Whether self&#8208;assembly or folding is preferred depends on the length of the oligomers, as well as the concentration and polarity of the solvents.







Abstract
The pseudopeptide backbone provided by N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;glycine oligomers with attached nucleobases has been widely utilized in peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as DNA mimics. Here we demonstrate the suitability of this backbone for the formation of structurally defined dye stacks. Toward this goal a series of peptide merocyanine (PMC) dye oligomers connected to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;glycine backbone were prepared through peptide synthesis. Our concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption studies show that under the control of dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, smaller&#8208;sized oligomers consisting of one, two or three dyes self&#8208;assemble into defined duplex structures containing two up to six chromophores. In contrast, upon further extension of the oligomer, the chosen peptide backbone cannot direct the formation of a defined duplex architecture anymore due to intramolecular aggregation between the dyes. For all aggregate species a moderate aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement is observed.

         <title>Widely Distributed Bifunctional Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Catalyze both Intramolecular C&#8722;C Bond Formation in cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr and Its Coupling with Nucleobases</title>

         <dc:description>
Bioinformatic analysis unveiled a widely distributed two&#8208;gene locus (gym) in actinobacteria. Reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathways and biochemical investigation led to the characterization of the cytochrome P450s GymBs as dual&#8208;functional oxidases, which catalyze both intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling reactions at different positions of cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr to generate novel tyrosine&#8208;based alkaloids.







Abstract
Tailoring enzymes are important modification biocatalysts in natural product biosynthesis. We report herein six orthologous two&#8208;gene clusters for mycocyclosin and guatyromycine biosynthesis. Expression of the cyclodipeptide synthase genes gymA1&#8211;gymA6 in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr as the major product. Reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathways in Streptomyces albus and biochemical investigation proved that the cytochrome P450 enzymes GymB1&#8211;GymB6 act as both intramolecular oxidases and intermolecular nucleobase transferases. They catalyze not only the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling within cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr, leading to mycocyclosin, but also its connection with guanine and hypoxanthine, and are thus responsible for the formation of tyrosine&#8208;containing guatyromycines, instead of the reported tryptophan&#8208;nucleobase adducts. Phylogenetic data suggest the presence of at least 47 GymB orthologues, indicating the occurrence of a widely distributed enzyme class.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;Vinylbenzyl Alcohols with Chiral Boro&#8208;Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral boro&#8208;phosphates were developed from chiral phosphoric acids and Piers&#8217; borane via the release of H2. A highly enantioselective hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols was further demonstrated, furnishing optically active 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives in high yields with up to 97&#8201;% ee. It is supposed that these boro&#8208;phosphates possibly interact with the substrates through O&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
Asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkenes represents a very important approach to access optically active cyclic ethers. It was found that B(C6F5)3 could catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols with only 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading, affording the desired product in high yields. To accomplish the asymmetric reaction, a novel type of chiral boro&#8208;phosphates was developed by treating chiral phosphoric acid with Piers&#8217; borane, in which the oxygen atom of P=O and the boron atom act as Lewis base and acid centers, respectively. A highly enantioselective hydroalkoxylation was successfully realized to give optically active 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran derivatives in 78&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 60&#8211;97&#8201;% ee's, in which an activation of O&#8722;H bond of alcohols by the boro&#8208;phosphate species is hypothesized.

         <title>Chemoselective and Diastereoselective Intramolecular (3+2) Cycloadditions of Epoxy and Aziridinyl Enolsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in diastereoselective intramolecular stepwise (3+2) cycloadditions with acyclic dienes, outcompeting the (4+3) cycloaddition pathway almost exclusively. Computations reveal the factors behind this preference. Optically&#8208;enriched trans&#8208;hydrindanone cycloadducts can be generated.







Abstract
Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in highly chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular (3+2) cycloadditions with a range of dienes and olefins. With acyclic dienes, the (3+2) cycloaddition outcompetes the (4+3) pathway traditionally observed in this kind of system almost exclusively. With both conjugated dienes and isolated olefins, excellent diastereoselectivities are observed, and cycloadducts can be obtained in optically&#8208;enriched forms. Computational studies indicate that the stepwise (3+2) cycloaddition involves an activated epoxy/aziridinyl intermediate and the conformational flexibility of the intermediate determines the preference for (3+2) cycloadduct formation. Further transformations of the (3+2) cycloadducts produce densely functionalized trans&#8208;hydrindane scaffolds.

         <title>A Liquid Interfacial SERS Platform on a Nanoparticle Array Stabilized by Rigid Probes for the Quantification of Norepinephrine in Rat Brain Microdialysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high reproducibility liquid interfacial SERS platform was created for the accurate quantification of the variation of norepinephrine (NE) in rat brain microdialysis during stress. Rigid probe molecules efficiently fixed the interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis and selective recognition of NE. Using this powerful tool, it was discovered that the treatment of stress induced anxiety was regulated by c&#8208;fos.







Abstract
For the reliable determination of trace chemicals in the brain, we created a SERS platform based on a functionalized AuNPs array formed at a liquid/liquid interface in a uniform fashion over a large substrate area through ternary regulations for real&#8208;time quantification of trace norepinephrine (NE). The rigid molecule, 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;ylethynyl)&#8208;benzaldehyde (RP1) was designed and co&#8208;assembled at AuNPs with 4&#8208;mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) to chemically define NE via dual recognition. Meanwhile, the rigid structure assembly of RP1 and MPBA efficiently fixed the interparticle gap, guaranteeing reproducible SERS analysis. Furthermore, the Raman peak of C&#8801;C group in the silent region was taken as a response element to further improve the accuracy. Combined with microdialysis, this SERS platform was developed for in&#8208;the&#8208;field testing of NE in rat brain microdialysates following anxiety.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylacylation of Allenes Using Acylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of a C&#8722;Si bond in acylsilanes across allenes is reported. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, in which a silyl group binds to the central carbon of the allene, allowing for the straightforward access to functionalized alkenylsilane derivatives.

We have developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of a C&#8722;Si bond of acylsilanes across a range of unactivated allenes. The reaction proceeds with complete regioselectivity, in which a silyl group binds to the central carbon of the allene, allowing for the straightforward access to functionalized alkenylsilane derivatives.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique 0D/2D WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11&#8197;wt.%) were constructed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, applying a cell voltage of 1.66&#8197;V to realize acidic overall water splitting (OWS) with excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
We report the strong catalyst&#8211;support interaction in WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2&#8208;WC NPs) anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11&#8197;wt.%), which significantly promotes the oxygen evolution reaction activity with a &#951;10 of 347&#8197;mV and a mass activity of 1430&#8197;A&#8201;gRu&#8722;1, eight&#8208;fold higher than that of commercial RuO2 (176&#8197;A&#8201;gRu&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst&#8211;support interaction between RuO2 and the WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce the reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic overall water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer with a good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO2&#8208;WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66&#8197;V to afford 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combining a WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS applications.

         <title>Activating a [FeFe] Hydrogenase Mimic for Hydrogen Evolution under Visible Light**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precious metal&#8208;free photocatalyst PS&#8208;CAT consisting of a [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic was utilized in the scope of hydrogen generation under visible light. The dyad comprising a &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophene as light absorber shows a remarkably high photocatalytic activity. In accordance with theory, operando EPR spectroscopy using BIH as sacrificial donor reveals the generation of an active [FeIFe0] species during the irradiation experiment.







Abstract
Inspired by the active center of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases, we designed a compact and precious metal&#8208;free photosensitizer&#8208;catalyst dyad (PS&#8208;CAT) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. PS&#8208;CAT represents a prototype dyad comprising &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophenes as light absorbers. PS&#8208;CAT and its interaction with the sacrificial donor 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazoline were studied by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical techniques and visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic investigations. Operando EPR spectroscopy revealed the formation of an active [FeIFe0] species&#8212;in accordance with theoretical calculations&#8212;presumably driving photocatalysis effectively (TON&#8776;210).

         <title>Cylindrical C96 Fullertubes: A Highly Active Metal&#8208;Free O2&#8208;Reduction Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behavior of C60, C70 (spheroidal fullerenes), and C90, C96, and C100 (tubular fullerenes) is explored using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques. C96 (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with an onset potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a halfway potential of 0.75&#8197;V, which are close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst values.







Abstract
A new isolation protocol was recently reported for highly purified metallic Fullertubes D5h&#8208;C90, D3d&#8208;C96, and D5d&#8208;C100, which exhibit unique electronic features. Here, we report the oxygen reduction electrocatalytic behavior of C60, C70 (spheroidal fullerenes), and C90, C96, and C100 (tubular fullerenes) using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. C96 (a metal&#8208;free catalyst) displayed remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with an onset potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a halfway potential of 0.75&#8197;V, which are close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C benchmark catalyst values. We achieved an excellent power density of 0.75&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using C96 as a modified cathode in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell, comparable to other recently reported efficient metal&#8208;free catalysts. Combined band structure (experimentally calculated) and free&#8208;energy (DFT) investigations show that both favorable energy&#8208;level alignment active catalytic sites on the carbon cage are responsible for the superior activity of C96.

         <title>Acridine&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) as Photocatalysts for Metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of porous crystalline COFs bearing acridine moieties was synthesized and applied as photocatalysts in metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling. Among these materials the fully &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COF showed the highest catalytic activity and was shown to be recyclable and even catalyzed the cross&#8208;coupling efficiently under green light irradiation.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are structurally tuneable, porous and crystalline polymers constructed through the covalent attachment of small organic building blocks as elementary units. Using the myriad of such building blocks, a broad spectrum of functionalities has been applied for COF syntheses for broad applications, including heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new family of porous and crystalline COFs using a novel acridine linker and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde derivatives bearing a variable number of hydroxy groups. With the broad absorption in the visible light region, the COFs were applied as photocatalysts in metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling. The fully &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine linked COF showed the highest activity, due to the increased charge separation upon irradiation. The COF showed good to excellent yields for several aryl bromides, good recyclability and even catalyzed the organic transformation in presence of green light as energy source.

         <title>Tacticity Control of Cyclic Poly(3&#8208;Thiobutyrate) Prepared by Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Racemic &#946;&#8208;Thiobutyrolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotactic or syndiotactic cyclic poly(3&#8208;thiobutyrolactone) (P3TB) was obtained from ring&#8208;opening polymerization of racemic &#946;&#8208;thiobutyrolactone (rac&#8208;TBL) promoted by achiral yttrium catalysts. The tacticity of cyclic polythioesters can be readily switched upon tuning the bulkiness of the substituents on the catalyst ligand.







Abstract
We report here on the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of racemic &#946;&#8208;thiobutyrolactone (rac&#8208;TBL), as the first chemical synthesis of poly(3&#8208;thiobutyrolactone) (P3TB), the thioester analogue of the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB). The ROP reactions proceed very fast (TOF &gt;12&#8201;000&#8197;h&#8722;1 at r.t.) in the presence of various metal&#8208;based catalysts. Remarkably, catalyst systems based on non&#8208;chiral yttrium complexes stabilized by tetradentate amino alkoxy&#8208; or diamino&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligands {ONXOR1,R2}2&#8722; (X=O, N) provide access to cyclic P3TB with either high isoselectivity (Pm up to 0.90) or high syndiotactic bias (Pr up to 0.70). The stereoselectivity can be controlled by manipulation of the substituents on the ligand platform and adequate choice of the reaction solvent and temperature as well. The cyclic polymer topology is evidenced by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS, NMR and TGA. Highly isotactic cyclic P3TB is a semi&#8208;crystalline material as revealed by DSC.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystal via a Persistent Radical Cation Acceptor for Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A unique charge&#8208;transfer cocrystal is constructed via a persistent 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+.) electron acceptor. The strong electron affinity and long&#8208;wavelength absorption of ABTS+. enable the resultant cocrystal with a full solar spectrum absorption, which yields an evaporation rate of 1.407&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 97.0&#8201;% in solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation.







Abstract
Designing organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals for efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion is a long&#8208;sought goal but remains challenging. Here we construct a unique CT cocrystal by using a persistent 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+.) as the electron acceptor. The strong persistency and electron affinity of ABTS+. endow a high degree of electron delocalization between ABTS+. and the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine donor. Together with the intrinsic long&#8208;wavelength absorption of ABTS+., the synthesized cocrystal can effectively capture the full solar spectrum and show distinguished photothermal efficiency. Such a cocrystal is further used for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation, and a high evaporation rate of 1.407&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 97.0&#8201;% have been achieved upon 1 sun irradiation. This work indicates the enormous prospects for charge transfer&#8208;based functional materials through rational radical cation engineering.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Redox Looping of a Rhodium/CexWO3 Photocatalyst for Highly Active and Robust Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst for dry reforming of methane, Rh/CexWO3, invokes both photothermal and photoelectric activation processes. Light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer takes place in the photocatalyst, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species. High oxygen mobility of CexWO3, accompanied with the formation of oxo&#8208;bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has provided an effective avenue to convert two greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2, into syngas. Here, we design a DRM photocatalyst Rh/CexWO3 that invokes both photothermal and photoelectric processes, which overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of DRM under conventional conditions. In contrast to plasmonic or UV&#8208;response photocatalysts, our photocatalyst produces a superior light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 4.65&#8201;% with a moderate light intensity. We propose that a light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer plays a crucial role in the DRM reaction, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species to lower the activation energy. Quantum mechanical studies reveal that a high oxygen mobility of CexWO3, accompanied with the formation of oxo&#8208;bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction. Our catalyst design strategy could offer a promising energy&#8208;efficient industrial process for DRM.

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Triazacyclononane Anchor Affords High Operational Stability for CO2RR by a CNT&#8208;Supported Histidine&#8208;Tagged CODH</title>

A pyrene&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;Ni carbon&#8208;nanotube anchor affords million&#8208;turnover stability for an electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction reaction by a recombinant carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.







Abstract
An original 1&#8208;acetato&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;pyrenyl)&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (AcPyTACN) was synthesized for the immobilization of a His&#8208;tagged recombinant CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum (RrCODH) on carbon&#8208;nanotube electrodes. The strong binding of the enzyme at the Ni&#8208;AcPyTACN complex affords a high current density of 4.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 towards electroenzymatic CO2 reduction and a high stability of more than 6&#215;106&#8197;TON when integrated on a gas&#8208;diffusion bioelectrode.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on intracellular supramolecular self&#8208;assembly that follows different strategies via host&#8211;guest interactions, enzymes, and polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The resulting in cellulo non&#8208;natural aggregates, including nanofibers, gels, nanoparticles, and colloidal droplets of coacervate, exhibit a variety of topological structures suitable for applications ranging from cancer treatment to bioimaging.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions rely on non&#8208;covalent forces, such as hydrophobic effects, hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and electrostatic interactions, which govern many intracellular biological pathways. In cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is mainly based on host&#8211;guest interactions, changes in pH, enzymes, and polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly to accurately induce various unnatural reactions without disturbing natural biological processes. This process can produce synthetic biocompatible macromolecules to control cell properties and regulate biological functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. This Minireview focuses on the latest reports in the field of in cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and anticipates future advances regarding its activation in response to internal and external stimuli, such as pH changes, reactive oxygen species, and enzymes, as well as external light illumination.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Alkyl (Hetero)Aryl Ketones by an Engineered Amine Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amine dehydrogenase (Ja&#8208;AmDH) has been developed by a directed evolution approach for the direct asymmetric reductive amination of alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones. The engineered enzyme provided access to a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl primary amines in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric reductive amination of heteroaryl ketones has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here we report the engineering of an amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) from Jeotgalicoccus aerolatus for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl primary amines in excellent conversions (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The best AmDH variant (Ja&#8208;AmDH&#8208;M33) exhibited high activity and specificity toward alkyl (hetero)aryl ketones, even for those bearing a bulky alkyl chain. An efficient directed evolution approach based on molecular docking was implemented to enlarge the active pocket with a more hydrophobic entrance, which is responsible for the high activity. The Ja&#8208;AmDH&#8208;M33 was also used for preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant amines and a key intermediate of chiral pincer ligands, which highlighted its practical application in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Nickel/Copper&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Benzylation of Aldimine Esters for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first asymmetric Ni/Cu cocatalyzed benzylation of aldimine esters is reported. A series of benzyl substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary amino acids could be synthesized in high yield and with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 90% yield and 99% ee). The experimental and theoretical calculation results suggested that the strong electrophilicity of the  &#951;3&#8208;benzylnickel intermediate is crucial for the high reactivity, enabling the reaction under base&#8208;free conditions. Furthermore, this method has been applied to the synthesis of the cell adhesion inhibitor BIRT&#8208;377 analogues, and the key intermediate of NK1 receptor antagonist PD154075 and CCK&#8208;B receptor antagonist CI&#8208;988.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethers are of central importance in the fields of biomass, energy, and organic chemistry. Herein, a novel cobalt&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative coupling of ethers with amines to construct &#945;&#8208;carbonylated ethers has been achieved. Remarkably, Alfuzosin, a medicine for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), can be synthesized by this process straightforwardly. Notably, this protocol presents the first example on the direct carbonylative reaction of ethers.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond a Linker: The Role of Photochemistry of Crosslinkers in the Direct Optical Patterning of Colloidal Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface chemistry mediated direct optical patterning represents an emerging strategy for incorporating colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) in integrated optoelectronic platforms including displays and image sensors. However, the role of photochemistry of crosslinkers and other photoactive species in the patterning remains elusive. Here we show the design of nitrene&#8208; and carbene&#8208;based photocrosslinkers can strongly affect the patterning capabilities and photophysical properties of NCs, especially quantum dots (QDs). Their role beyond physical linkers stems from structure&#8208;dictated electronic configuration, energy alignment and associated reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. Patterned QD layers with designed carbene&#8208;based crosslinkers fully preserve their photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties. Patterned light emitting diodes (QLEDs) show maximum external quantum efficiency of ~12% and lifetime over 4800 h, among the highest for reported patterned QLEDs. These results would guide the rational design of photoactive species in NC patterning and create new possibilities in the monolithic integration of NCs in high&#8208;performance device platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous CO2 Reduction on Si Photocathodes Functionalized by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts/Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocathode prepared by attaching a molecular cobalt catalyst on a n+&#8208;p Si film coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibits 100&#8201;% selectivity and 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in aqueous media under simulated sunlight irradiation. The high performance benefits from CNTs as both a support platform for highly dispersed molecular active sites and an efficient mediator for charge transfer.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for renewable fuel production. We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO2&#8208;protected n+&#8208;p Si electrodes (Si|TiO2) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of CoII(BrqPy) (BrqPy=4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si|TiO2, a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density of &#8722;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 2&#8197;h in a neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8722;0.11&#8197;V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOFCO) of 2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10&#8197;h, a remarkable turnover number (TONCO) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Regulated Self&#8208;Blinking Fluorescent Probe for Resolving Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosomes with Long&#8208;Term Nanoscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
LysoSR&#8208;549 as a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore for SMLM imaging of lysosomes is reported. It enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosome distribution, size, luminal pH, movement trajectories and interactions between lysosomes.







Abstract
Long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging appears to be increasingly important for unraveling organelle dynamics at the nanoscale, but is challenging due to the need for highly photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes. Here, we report a self&#8208;blinking fluorophore that achieved 12&#8197;nm spatial resolution and 20&#8197;ms time resolution under acidic lysosomal conditions. This fluorophore was successfully applied in super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosomal dynamics over 40&#8197;min. The pH dependence of the dye during blinking made the fluorophore sensitive to lysosomal pH. This probe enables simultaneous dynamic and pH recognition of all lysosomes in the entire cell at the single&#8208;lysosome&#8208;resolved level, which allowed us to resolve whole&#8208;cell lysosome subpopulations based on lysosomal distribution, size, and luminal pH. We also observed a variety of lysosome movement trajectories and different types of interactions modes between lysosomes.

         <title>More than a Leaving Group: N&#8208;Phenyltrifluoroacetimidate as a Remote Directing Group for Highly &#945;&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;cis Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl group at O6 was found to be highly stereodirecting for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Its remote participation is supported by characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic cation intermediates as well as other experimental evidence.







Abstract
The anomeric configuration can greatly affect the biological functions and activities of carbohydrates. Herein, we report that N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl (PTFAI), a well&#8208;known leaving group for catalytic glycosylation, can act as a stereodirecting group for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Utilizing rapidly accessible 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;OPTFAI glycosyl donors, TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation occurred with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity and broad substrate scope, and the remaining 6&#8208;OPTFAI group can be cleaved chemoselectively. The remote participation of 6&#8208;OPTFAI is supported by the first characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic oxazepinium ion intermediates by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy. These cations were found to be relatively stable and mainly responsible for the present stereoselectivities. Further application is highlighted in glycosylation reactions toward trisaccharide heparins as well as the convergent synthesis of chacotriose derivatives using a bulky 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated donor.

         <title>Crystalline Germanium(I) and Tin(I) Centered Radical Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky diamido ligand, is reported. Comprehensive characterization of these species was achieved by using EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis. The results obtained reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron resides, almost exclusively, in a p&#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the metal center itself.







Abstract
An isostructural series of heavy Group 14 E(I) radical anions (Ge, Sn, Pb), stabilized by a bulky xanthene&#8208;based diamido ligand are reported. The radical anions were synthesised by the one&#8208;electron reduction of their corresponding E(II) precursor complexes with sodium naphthalenide in THF, yielding the radical anions as charge&#8208;separated sodium salts. The series of main group radicals have been comprehensively characterized by EPR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analysis, which reveal that in all cases, the spin density of the unpaired electron almost exclusively resides in a p&#8208;orbital of &#960; symmetry located on the Group 14 center.

         <title>PO43&#8722; Coordinated Robust Single&#8208;Atom Platinum Catalyst for Selective Polyol Oxidation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Pt1/hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst is successfully synthesized by a simple and green hydrothermal strategy. Benefiting from the strong PO43&#8722;&#8208;coordination effect, Pt1/HAP exhibits outstanding catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability without Pt leaching for the selective oxidation of C2&#8211;C4 polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids over long periods of operation (&gt;160&#8197;h).







Abstract
Achieving efficient catalytic conversion over a heterogeneous catalyst with excellent resistance against leaching is still a grand challenge for sustainable chemical synthesis in aqueous solution. Herein, we devised a single&#8208;atom Pt1/hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst via a simple hydrothermal strategy. Gratifyingly, this robust Pt1/HAP catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic selectivity and catalyst stability for the selective oxidation of C2&#8211;C4 polyols to corresponding primary hydroxy acids. It is found that the Pt&#8722;(O&#8722;P) linkages with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing function of PO43&#8722; (Pt1&#8722;OPO43&#8722; pair active site) not only realize the activation of the C&#8722;H bond, but also destabilize the transition state from adsorbed hydroxy acids toward the C&#8722;C cleavage, resulting in the sharply increased selectivity of hydroxy acids. Moreover, the strong PO43&#8722;&#8208;coordination effect provides electrostatic stabilization for single&#8208;atom Pt, ensuring the highly efficient catalysis of Pt1/HAP for over 160&#8197;hours with superior leaching resistance.

         <title>A Glycoform&#8208;Resolved Dual&#8208;Modal Ratiometric Immunoassay Improves the Diagnostic Precision for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking both terminal sialic acid and core fucose into account, a molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)&#8208;based dual&#8208;modal ratiometric immunoassay was developed for the precise diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three MIPs orthogonally recognize the N&#8208;terminal epitope, C&#8208;terminal epitope and glycans of glycoprotein biomarkers, and dual&#8208;modal detection provides two independent glycans/glycoprotein values, enabling self&#8208;validating, high&#8208;contrast, and more precise diagnosis compared to antibodies&#8208;based methods.







Abstract
The glycosylation pattern of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) paves the basis for precise early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, existing analytical methods ignore the contribution of terminal sialic acid, which has been reported to be highly connected with HCC. Besides, the development of diagnostic assays is severely hindered by the preparation of anti&#8208;glycans antibodies. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), as synthetic antibody mimics, provide unique strengths to address these issues. Herein, we report a MIPs&#8208;based dual&#8208;modal ratiometric immunoassay for precise HCC diagnosis. Using a &#8220;pit one against ten&#8221; MIP to recognize a subset of glycans containing sialic acid and/or core fucose, we demonstrated our assay exhibited improved precision as compared with ELISA. This assay provided not only a glycoform&#8208;resolved method for precise HCC diagnosis, but also a new paradigm for developing antibody mimics via molecular imprinting towards challenging biomedical applications.

         <title>Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion at an InSn&#8208;Enriched Liquid&#8208;Metal Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renewable energy driven electrochemical conversion of nitrates to ammonia is emerging as a viable route for the creation of this hydrogen carrier. However, the creation of highly efficient electrocatalysts that show prolonged stability is an ongoing challenge. Here we show that room temperature liquid metal Galinstan can be used as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for nitrate conversion to ammonia achieving rates of up to 2335 &#181;g h  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  with a Faradaic efficiency of 100%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observation indicated the activity is due to InSn alloy enrichment within the liquid metal that occurs during the electrocatalytic reaction. This high selectivity for NH  3  is also due to additional suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the identified In  3  Sn active site. This work adds to the increasing applicability of liquid metals based on Ga for clean energy technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Behavior Triggered by Helical Nanofibers from Chiral Co&#8208;assembly Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two chiral binaphthyl polymers (  R  /  S  &#8208;P1  and  R  /  S  &#8208;P2  ) with different dihedral angles of binaphthyl moiety were chosen as chiral inducers to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies with an achiral pyrene&#8208;naphthalimide dye (  NPy  ) and then acted as the emitting layer (EML) of CP&#8208;EL devices. The anchored dihedral angle of  R  /  S  &#8208;P2  not only exhibited the enhanced chirality signal, but also had a strong chirality&#8208;inducing effect on the achiral  NPy  dye in the chiral co&#8208;assembly (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  . After annealing at 120 &#176;C, the CPL signal (|  g  em  |) of ordered helical nano&#8208;fibers  (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  was amplified to 5.6&#215;10  &#8208;2  , which was about 6&#8208;fold larger than that of  (  R  /  S  &#8208;P1)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  . The amplified  g  em  value of  (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  was due to the formation of a helical co&#8208;assembly through the strong  &#960;&#8208;&#960;  stacking interaction between the  R  /  S  &#8208;P2  and the achiral  NPy  . This kind of ordered helical nano&#8208;fibers (  R  /  S  &#8208;P2)  0.6  &#8208;(NPy)  0.4  acted as the EML of CP&#8208;OLEDs, and achieved an excellent CP&#8208;EL performance (|  g  EL  | = 4.8&#215;10  &#8208;2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Effects on Aqueous Electrolyte for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As two stable hydrogen isotopes, protium and deuterium show magnified isotope effects in physicochemical properties due to the significantly varied atomic masses. In this work, aqueous electrolytes based on heavy water (D  2  O) and light water (H  2  O) were prepared to reveal the electrochemical isotope effects between the hydrogen isotopes. The covalent hydrogen&#8208;oxygen bond and intermolecular hydrogen bond in D  2  O are much stronger than those in H  2  O, making them thermodynamically more stable. Compared with the H  2  O&#8208;based electrolyte, the D  2  O&#8208;based electrolyte shows a broader electrochemical window, a higher percentage of coordinated water and a longer lifetime of hydrogen bond. Because of the above electrochemical isotope effects, the D  2  O&#8208;based electrolyte shows high anodic stability against operation of high&#8208;voltage layered oxide cathode materials including LiCoO  2  and LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  , which enables long cycle life and favorable rate performance of aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High Resolution NMR H/D Exchange of Human Superoxide Dismutase Inclusion Bodies Reveals Significant Native Features Despite Structural Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein aggregation is central to aging, disease and biotechnology. While there has been recent progress in defining structural features of cellular protein aggregates, many aspects remain unclear due to heterogeneity of aggregates presenting obstacles to characterization. Here we report high&#8208;resolution analysis of cellular inclusion bodies (IBs) of immature human superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants using NMR quenched amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (qHDX), FTIR and Congo red binding. The extent of aggregation is correlated with mutant global stability and, notably, the free energy of native dimer dissociation, indicating contributions of native&#8208;like monomer associations to IB formation. This is further manifested by a common pattern of extensive protection against H/D exchange throughout nine mutant SOD1s despite their diverse characteristics. These results reveal multiple aggregation&#8208;prone regions in SOD1 and illuminate how aggregation may occur via an ensemble of pathways</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Fast Synthesis of High&#8208;silica Zeolite Y with Remarkable Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;silica zeolite Y (FAU) plays a vital role in (petro)chemical industries. However, the slow nucleation and growth kinetics of high&#8208;silica FAU framework limit its direct synthesis and the improvement of framework SiO  2  /Al  2  O  3  ratio (SAR). Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the fast crystallization of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y, which involves the combination of high crystallization temperature, ultra&#8208;stable Y (USY) seeds and efficient organic&#8208;structure directing agent (OSDA). The synthesis can be finished in 5&#8208;16 h at 160  o  C and with tunable SAR up to 18.2. Combining experiments and theoretical calculations, the key factors affecting crystallization kinetics and phase purity are elucidated. Moreover, the crystallization process was monitored to reveal the fast crystal growth mechanism. The high&#8208;silica products possess high (hydro)thermal stability and abundant strong acid sites, which endow them excellent catalytic cracking performance, obviously superior to commercial USY.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#947;&#8208;Arylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Butenolides</title>

         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Butenolide and &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone scaffolds are two types of important core structures in numerous natural products and bioactive targets. However, methods to construct the chiral quaternary arylated &#947;&#8208;butenolide are rarely explored. We herein report an efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#947;&#8208;arylation of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated butenolides with aryl bromides, which shows high &#947;&#8208;selectivity, good functional group tolerance and excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, this protocol also allows for facile construction of tricyclic tetrahydroindolines and tetrahydroisoquinolinones in one step. DFT calculations are consistent with the experimental results, suggesting that the &#947;&#8208;arylation is favoured than the &#945;&#8208;arylation. Finally, this method is applied to the rapid synthesis of natural product (  R  )&#8208;(+)  &#8208;  boivinianin A.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glycosylative modification of peptides could improve the pharmacological properties of peptide drugs and deliver them efficiently to the target sites. Compared with  O  &#8208;/  N  &#8208;glycosides,  C  &#8208;glycosides exhibit more metabolic stability. We here disclose the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective  C  &#8208;glycosylation. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with various carbohydrate substrates, as demonstrated with a series of monosaccharides and a disaccharide, and are amenable to the synthesis of a wide variety of  C  &#8208;glycoamino acids and  C  &#8208;glycopeptidomimetics with good yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The dual&#8208;functional photocatalyst formed in situ via coordination of the glycine derivative and the chiral phosphine Cu complex could not only catalyze the photoredox process but also control the  s  tereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Regulation of Ni Single Atom by Confined Ni Nanoparticles for Energy&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic modulation of atomic dispersed active sites is promising to boost the catalytic activity, which is however remains a challenge. Here we show a cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom on nanoparticle catalyst (NiSA/NP) via direct solid&#8208;state pyrolysis, where Ni nanoparticles donate electrons to Ni(i)&#8208;N&#8208;C sites via carbon nanotubes network, achieving a high CO current density of 346 mA cm  &#8208;2  at &#8208;0.5 V vs RHE in an alkaline flow cell. When coupled with a NiFe&#8208;based oxygen evolution anode into a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrolyzer, it delivers an industrial&#8208;relevant CO current density of 310 mA cm  &#8208;2  at a low cell voltage of &#8208;2.3 V, corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 57%. The superior CO  2  electroreduction performance is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediate COOH* on electron&#8208;rich Ni single atom, together with the dense active sites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Optical methods are promising to address the ever&#8208;increasing demands for chirality analysis in drug discovery and related fields because they are amenable to high&#8208;throughput screening. Noncovalent recognition&#8208;based chiroptical sensing by employing circular dichroism spectroscopy is especially appealing due to their fast equilibrium kinetics, wide substrate scope, and potential in sustainable development. In this minireview, we give an overview on this emerging field. General aspects involving molecular recognition and chirality transfer are analysed. Chirality sensors are discussed by dividing them into three classes according to their structural features. Applications of these chirality sensors in chirality analysis of the products of asymmetric reactions and in real&#8208;time monitoring of reaction kinetics are demonstrated with selected examples. Moreover, challenges and research directions in this field are also pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissipative Control over the Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand&#160;Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we show a general approach to achieve dissipative control over toehold&#8208;mediated strand&#8208;displacement, the most widely employed reaction in the field of DNA nanotechnology. The approach relies on rationally re&#8208;engineering the classic strand displacement reaction such that the high&#8208;energy invader strand (fuel) is converted into a low&#8208;energy waste product through an energy&#8208;dissipating reaction allowing the spontaneous return to the original state over time. We show that such dissipative control over the toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement process is reversible (up to 10 cycles), highly controllable and enables unique temporal activation of DNA systems. We show here two possible applications of this strategy: the transient labelling of DNA structures and the additional temporal control of cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Afterglow from Large&#8208;Area and Flexible Polymer&#8208;Based Transparent Films for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains a great challenge to develop polymer&#8208;based materials with efficient and color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow. Two indolocarbazole derivatives IaCzA and IbCzA have been synthesized and doped into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices. It is found that the resulting films can produce unique dual&#8208;mode afterglow, which is composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence. Besides, the IbCzA&#8208;doped PVA film exhibits intense blue afterglow with  &#934;  afterglow  and  &#964;  afterglow  up to 19.8% and 1.81 s, respectively, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow performance. Moreover, our reported film has high flexibility, excellent transparency, and large&#8208;area producibility; and the afterglow color of the film can be linearly tuned by temperature. Inspired by these distinctive properties, the PVA doped with IbCzA was employed as temperature&#8208;sensitive security ink for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;Trifluoromethylpyridines Enabled by Umpolung C&#8722;F Bond Activation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the trifluoromethyl group represents a formidable challenge. An asymmetric defluoroallylation reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines is reported, which features an umpolung C&#8722;F bond activation, a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Carbon&#8211;fluorine bond activation of the trifluoromethyl group represents an important approach to fluorine&#8208;containing molecules. While selective defluorinative functionalization reactions of CF3&#8208;containing substrates have been achieved by invoking difluorocarbocation, difluorocarboradical, or difluoroorganometallic species as the key intermediates, the transformations via fluorocarbanion mechanism only achieved limited success.

Here we report a defluorinative functionalization reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines involving difluoro(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl anion as the key intermediate, which was developed based upon our previous studies on the N&#8208;boryl pyridyl anion chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the trifluoromethyl group represents a formidable challenge. An asymmetric defluoroallylation reaction of 4-trifluoromethylpyridines and -pyrimidines is reported, which features an umpolung C&#8722;F bond activation, a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon&#8211;fluorine bond activation of the trifluoromethyl group represents an important approach to fluorine-containing molecules. While selective defluorinative functionalization reactions of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-containing substrates have been achieved by invoking difluorocarbocation, difluorocarboradical, or difluoroorganometallic species as the key intermediates, the transformations via fluorocarbanion mechanism only achieved limited success. Furthermore, the enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group remained a formidable challenge. Here we report a defluorinative functionalization reaction of 4-trifluoromethylpyridines involving difluoro(pyrid-4-yl)methyl anion as the key intermediate, which was developed based upon our previous studies on the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-boryl pyridyl anion chemistry. In particular, asymmetric defluoroallylation of 4-trifluoromethylpyridines and -pyrimidines could be achieved by using Ir-catalysis to forge a difluoroalkyl-substituted chiral center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layered Cu5 Nanoclusters on FeS2 with Dual Catalytic Sites for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual Cu&#8722;Fe catalytic centers situated at the perimeter region of Cu5/FeS2 facilitate H2O2 adsorption and barrierless decomposition into &#8901;OH through forming a bridging Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;Fe structure, thereby realizing selective H2O2 activation with high efficiency and enabling excellent degradation activities of refractory organic pollutants.







Abstract
Regulating the distribution of reactive oxygen species generated from H2O2 activation is the prerequisite to ensuring the efficient and safe use of H2O2 in the chemistry and life science fields. Herein, we demonstrate that constructing a dual Cu&#8722;Fe site through the self&#8208;assembly of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layered Cu5 nanoclusters onto a FeS2 surface achieves selective H2O2 activation with high efficiency. Unlike its unitary Cu or Fe counterpart, the dual Cu&#8722;Fe sites residing at the perimeter zone of the Cu5/FeS2 interface facilitate H2O2 adsorption and barrierless decomposition into &#8901;OH via forming a bridging Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;Fe complex. The robust in situ formation of &#8901;OH governed by this atomic&#8208;layered catalyst enables the effective oxidation of several refractory toxic pollutants across a broad pH range, including alachlor, sulfadimidine, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, p&#8208;chlorophenol, p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene. This work highlights the concept of building a dual catalytic site in manipulating selective H2O2 activation on the surface molecular level towards efficient environmental control and beyond.

         <title>Enantiomeric Water&#8208;Soluble Octopus[3]arenes for Highly Enantioselective Recognition of Chiral Ammonium Salts in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes with rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities were easily synthesized. They exhibited highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with the association constant up to 106 and the S/R selectivity up to 12.89.







Abstract
Study of enantioselective recognition in water by synthetic chiral macrocyclic receptors is undoubtedly of theoretical and practical significance, but it is a big challenge to achieve the enantioselective recognition with both high enantioselectivity and high affinity in water probably due to the deficiency of such water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors with stable chiral cavities. Herein, we report a new class of chiral macrocyclic arenes named octopus[3]arenes. The enantiomeric macrocycles are composed of three homochiral ethenoanthracene subunits, and they can be synthesized by two pathways and then easily converted into water&#8208;soluble octopus[3]arenes P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1. Notably, P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1 with the rigid hexagonal structures and stable chiral hydrophobic cavities exhibit highly enantioselective recognition towards three pairs of chiral ammonium salts in water with the association constant up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and the S/R selectivity up to 12.89.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Condensation of [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; Metalloligand in Stepwise Assembly of Hexagonal and Rectangular Ag18 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Ag18 nanoclusters with different geometries are isolated by employing the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; metalloligand. The condensation degree of the metalloligand was strongly dependent on the alcohols. In the absence of alcohols, the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; can be controllably cyclized to form a wheel&#8208;like [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; to trap silver ions. In contrast, the similar cyclization reaction is completely blocked in the presence of alcohols.







Abstract
Stepwise assembly starting from a preassembled metalloligand is a promising approach to obtain otherwise unattainable silver nanoclusters, but hard to be intrinsically identified due to the lack of convincing evidence to justify such a process. Herein, hexagonal and rectangular Ag18 nanoclusters are constructed from the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; (H4PTC4A=p&#8208;phenyl&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene) metalloligand through stepwise assembly. The formation of the metalloligand is confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, then assembled with silver ions to form two geometrically different Ag18 nanoclusters in different solvents. The cyclization from the metalloligand to [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; can be realized without alcohols and otherwise blocked by them. The installation of this metalloligand not only provides comprehensive understanding of how the solvents regulate the silver nanocluster structures, but also brings new insights for the controllable ligand metallization and subsequent condensation.

         <title>Combination of Knoevenagel Polycondensation and Water&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Michael&#8208;Addition&#8208;Elimination for the Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked 2D COFs via Knoevenagel polycondensation and in situ water&#8208;assisted Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination: The addition of water can accelerate the Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for C=C bond exchange.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs), belonging to the class of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties. Despite the successful synthesis, it remains elusive for the relevant polymerization mechanism, which leads to relatively low crystallinity and poor reproducibility. In this work, we demonstrate the novel synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs via the combination of Knoevenagel polycondensation and water&#8208;assisted dynamic Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination, abbreviated as KMAE polymerization. The existence of C=C bond exchange between two diphenylacrylonitriles (M1 and M6) is firstly confirmed via in situ high&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy study of model reactions. Notably, the intermediate M4 synthesized via Michael&#8208;addition can proceed the Michael&#8208;elimination quantitatively, leading to an efficient C=C bond exchange, unambiguously confirming the dynamic nature of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination. Furthermore, the addition of water can significantly promote the reaction rate of Michael&#8208;addition&#8208;elimination for highly efficient C=C bond exchange within 5&#8197;mins. As a result, the KMAE polymerization provides a highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by four examples of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;PDAN, V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;TFPB&#8208;BDAN, and V&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN, based on the simulated and experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns as well as N2&#8208;adsorption&#8211;desorption measurements.

     alt="Combination of Knoevenagel Polycondensation and Water-Assisted Dynamic Michael-Addition-Elimination for the Synthesis of Vinylene-Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of vinylene-linked 2D COFs via Knoevenagel polycondensation and in situ water-assisted Michael-addition-elimination: The addition of water can accelerate the Michael-addition-elimination for C=C bond exchange.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinylene-linked two-dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (V-2D-COFs), belonging to the class of two-dimensional conjugated polymers, have attracted increasing attention due to their extended &#960;-conjugation over the 2D backbones associated with high chemical stability. The Knoevenagel polycondensation has been demonstrated as a robust synthetic method to provide cyano (CN)-substituted V-2D-COFs with unique optoelectronic, magnetic, and redox properties. Despite the successful synthesis, it remains elusive for the relevant polymerization mechanism, which leads to relatively low crystallinity and poor reproducibility. In this work, we demonstrate the novel synthesis of CN-substituted V-2D-COFs via the combination of Knoevenagel polycondensation and water-assisted dynamic Michael-addition-elimination, abbreviated as &lt;b&gt;KMAE&lt;/b&gt; polymerization. The existence of C=C bond exchange between two diphenylacrylonitriles (&lt;b&gt;M1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;M6&lt;/b&gt;) is firstly confirmed via in situ high-temperature NMR spectroscopy study of model reactions. Notably, the intermediate &lt;b&gt;M4&lt;/b&gt; synthesized via Michael-addition can proceed the Michael-elimination quantitatively, leading to an efficient C=C bond exchange, unambiguously confirming the dynamic nature of Michael-addition-elimination. Furthermore, the addition of water can significantly promote the reaction rate of Michael-addition-elimination for highly efficient C=C bond exchange within 5&#8197;mins. As a result, the &lt;b&gt;KMAE&lt;/b&gt; polymerization provides a highly efficient strategy for the synthesis of CN-substituted V-2D-COFs with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by four examples of V-2D-COF-TFPB-PDAN, V-2D-COF-TFPT-PDAN, V-2D-COF-TFPB-BDAN, and V-2D-COF-HATN-BDAN, based on the simulated and experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns as well as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adsorption&#8211;desorption measurements. Moreover, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis shows crystalline domain sizes ranging from 20 to 100&#8197;nm for the newly synthesized V-2D-COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Following Repetitive Stimulation Reveals a Mechanism for Plasticity Changes with Iron Deficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron deficiency&#8208;induced neurochemical changes are linked to cognitive impairment. Alteration in plasticity is observed as a decrease in fractional release during repetitive stimulation and iron deficiency. This alteration in fractional release is likely to be one of the mechanisms that underlie the negative impact of iron deficiency on plasticity, and the long&#8208;term deficits in learning and memory.







Abstract
Deficiency of iron, the most abundant transition metal in the brain and important for neuronal activity, is known to affect synaptic plasticity, causing learning and memory deficits. How iron deficiency impacts plasticity by altering neurotransmission at the cellular level is not fully understood. We used electrochemical methods to study the effect of iron deficiency on plasticity with repetitive stimulation. We show that during iron deficiency, repetitive stimulation causes significant decrease in exocytotic release without changing vesicular content. This results in a lower fraction of release, opposite to the control group, upon repetitive stimulation. These changes were partially reversible by iron repletion. This finding suggests that iron deficiency has a negative effect on plasticity by decreasing the fraction of vesicular release in response to repetitive stimulation. This provides a putative mechanism for how iron deficiency modulates plasticity.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3H&#8208;Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General and efficient asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles has been realized using a well&#8208;defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 99&#8201;% ee and a record TON of 72&#8201;350 in an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles represents an ideal approach to the synthesis of useful chiral indoline scaffolds. However, very few catalytic systems based on precious metals have been developed to realize this challenging reaction. Herein, we report a Mn&#8208;catalyzed AH of 3H&#8208;indoles with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic resolution of racemic 3H&#8208;indoles by AH was also achieved with high s&#8208;factors to construct quaternary stereocenters. Many acid&#8208;sensitive functional groups, which cannot be tolerated when using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ruthenium catalyst, were compatible with manganese catalysis. This new process expands the scope of this transformation and highlights the uniqueness of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis. The reaction could proceed with catalyst loadings at the parts per million (ppm) level with an exceptional turnover number of 72&#8201;350. This is the highest value yet reported for an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.

         <title>Modular Generation of (Iodinated) Polyarenes Using Triethylgermane as Orthogonal Masking Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling is disclosed herein, relying on organogermane&#8208;containing building blocks paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction, which allows to significantly shorten the reaction times and close gaps in the accessible compound space.







Abstract
While the modular construction of molecules from suitable building blocks is a powerful means to more rapidly generate a diversity of molecules than through customized syntheses, the further evolution of the underlying coupling methodology is key to realize widespread applications. We herein disclose a complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling strategy of boron containing precursors, which relies on organogermane containing building blocks as key orthogonal functionality and an electrophilic (rather than nucleophilic) unmasking event paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction. This allows to significantly shorten the reaction times for the iterative coupling steps and/or to close gaps in the accessible compound space, enabling straightforward access also to iodinated compounds.

A new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) was proposed. Developing the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs is a facile and general strategy with the combination of the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, which enables &gt;18&#8201;% device efficiency together with improved stability.







Abstract
Although ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have unique advantages in improving device performance, the morphology assembly in the ternary&#8208;phase would be more uncertain or complex than that in the binary&#8208;phase. Here, we propose a new concept of oligomer&#8208;assisted photoactive layers for high&#8208;performance OSCs. The formed alloy&#8208;like phase of the oligomer&#8201;:&#8201;host polymer blend enabled the oligomer&#8208;assisted OSCs to fuse the advantages of both binary and ternary devices, exhibiting substantially enhanced performance and stability compared to the control devices. With the addition of oligomers, outstanding efficiencies of 17.33&#8201;% for a PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 device, 18.32&#8201;% for a PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 device, and 17.13&#8201;% for a PM6/Y6 pseudo&#8208;bilayer device were achieved, all of which are one of the highest values in their corresponding fields. The improved performance originated from the downshift energy levels, enhanced light absorption, optimized blend morphology, favorable charge dynamics, and reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss.

         <title>Tuning the Spin State of the Iron Center by Bridge&#8208;Bonded Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti Ligands for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;state tuning for atomic Fe center s(FeN3O) is attained through introducing an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti bridge bond in atomic&#8208;Fe doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots/ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene (o&#8208;MQFe) hybrids. This low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin&#8208;state transition gives the o&#8208;MQFe catalyst stronger O2 adsorption affinity and thus a higher intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.







Abstract
Exploring functional substrates and precisely regulating the electronic structures of atomic metal active species with moderate spin state are of great importance yet remain challenging. Hereon, we provide an axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligand regulated spin&#8208;state transition strategy to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe centers. Theoretical calculations indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands in FeN3O&#8208;O&#8208;Ti can induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;medium spin&#8208;state transition and optimize O2 adsorption by FeN3O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the oriented catalyst was prepared from atomic&#8208;Fe&#8208;doped polymer&#8208;like quantum dots and ultrathin o&#8208;terminated MXene. The optimal catalyst exhibits an intrinsic activity that is almost 5&#8197;times higher than the control sample (without axial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ti ligands). It also delivers a superior performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries and H2/O2 anion exchange membrane fuel cells in a wide&#8208;temperature range.

&lt;p&gt;The spin-state tuning for atomic Fe center s(FeN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O) is attained through introducing an axial Fe-O-Ti bridge bond in atomic-Fe doped polymer-like quantum dots/ultrathin o-terminated MXene (o-MQFe) hybrids. This low-to-medium spin-state transition gives the o-MQFe catalyst stronger O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption affinity and thus a higher intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Disproportionation of Nitric Oxide at a Surface&#8208;Bound Nickel Porphyrinoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation already at room temperature. The high chemical reactivity of nitrogen oxides species, eventually present in the residual gas background, and of the possible reaction intermediates yields a challenging complexity, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.







Abstract
Uncommon metal oxidation states in porphyrinoid cofactors are responsible for the activity of many enzymes. The F430 and P450nor co&#8208;factors, with their reduced NiI&#8208; and FeIII&#8208;containing tetrapyrrolic cores, are prototypical examples of biological systems involved in methane formation and in the reduction of nitric oxide, respectively. Herein, using a comprehensive range of experimental and theoretical methods, we raise evidence that nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation at room temperature. The interpretation of the measurements is far from being straightforward due to the high reactivity of the different nitrogen oxides species (eventually present in the residual gas background) and of the possible reaction intermediates. The picture is detailed in order to disentangle the challenging complexity of the system, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Borylation of Aromatic Quaternary Ammonium and Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic sulfamate ligand based on a biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline skeleton was designed and applied to the para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidated the origin of this unusual selectivity.







Abstract
Aromatic ammonium and phosphonium salts are important synthetic intermediates and multifunctional materials, but para&#8208;selective functionalization of the aromatic salts remains a challenge. Here we develop an ionic ligand based on our newly designed &#8220;biphenyl&#8208;phenanthroline&#8221; skeleton and realize the Ir&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of seven types of aromatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium salts. Gram&#8208;scale transformation, late&#8208;stage elaboration for drug molecule, and diversification of borylated products demonstrate the potential utility of this reaction. The mechanistic studies and computational analysis elucidate the origin of para&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Allylboration of Alkynes with Allylic gem&#8208;Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective coupling of terminal alkynes, bis(pinacolato)diboron and allylic gem&#8208;dichlorides is reported. The method uses a chiral NHC&#8722;Cu catalyst which generates, in a single step, synthetically versatile chiral skipped dienes bearing a Z&#8208;alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenyl boronate and a bis&#8208;allylic stereocenter.







Abstract
Allylic gem&#8208;dichlorides are shown to be efficient substrates for catalytic asymmetric allylboration of alkynes. The method employs a chiral NHC&#8722;Cu catalyst capable of generating in a single step chiral skipped dienes bearing a Z&#8208;alkenyl chloride, a trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenyl boronate and a bis&#8208;allylic stereocenter with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. This high degree of functionalization makes these products versatile building blocks as illustrated with the synthesis of several optically active compounds. DFT calculations support the key presence of a metal cation bridge ligand&#8211;substrate interaction and account for the stereoselectivity outcome.

         <title>A Rare Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based on Tailorable Mn8&#8208;Cluster Showing Smart Responsiveness to Aromatic Guests and Capacity of Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and creation of soft porous crystals combining regularity and flexibility may promote potential applications on gas storage and separation due to their deformable framework's responsiveness to external stimuli. The flexibility of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) relies on alterable degrees of freedom that are mainly provided by organic linkers or the junctions linking organic and inorganic building units. Herein, we report a new dynamic MOF whose flexibility originates from an unprecedented tailorable Mn  8  O  38  &#8208;cluster and shows simultaneous coordination geometry changes and ligand migration that are reversibly driven by guest exchange. This provides an extra degree of freedom to the framework&#8217;s deformation, resulting in three&#8208;dimensional variations in the framework that subtly respond to varied aromatic molecules. The gas adsorption behavior of this flexible MOF was evaluated, and the selective separation of light hydrocarbons and Freon gases is achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Palladium Nanocrystals: Decoupling the Activity of Different Surface Sites on Nanocrystal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The existence of various surface active sites within a nanocrystal (NC) catalyst complicates understanding their respective catalytic properties and designing an optimal catalyst structure for a desired catalytic reaction. Here, we developed a novel approach that allows unequivocal investigation on the intrinsic catalytic reactivity of the edge and terrace atoms of NCs. Through the comparison of the catalytic behaviors of edge&#8208;covered Pd NCs, which were prepared by the selective deposition of catalytically inactive Au atoms onto the edge sites of rhombic dodecahedral (RD) Pd NCs, with those of the pristine RD Pd NCs toward alkyne hydrogenation and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions, we could decouple the activity of the edge and {110}&#8208;plane atoms of the Pd NCs without uncertainties. We expect that this study will provide an opportunity to scrutinize the surface properties of various NC catalysts to a more precise level and devise ideal catalysts for intended catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks via Asymmetric Organocatalysis for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and efficient organocatalytic asymmetric polymerization approach for synthesis of the chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) has been developed. With chiral 2&#8208;methylpyrrolidine catalyst, a series of tris(N&#8208;salicylideneamine)&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs are directly constructed from prochiral aldehyde&#8208; and primary amine&#8208;monomers. The adopted aminocatalytic asymmetric Schiff&#8208;base condensation herein is performed under ambient conditions with clear green synthetic advantages over the conventional acid&#8208;catalysed solvothermal methods. The obtained &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs can be further metalated by solid&#8208;state coordination approach, and the resulting Cu(II)@CCOFs can highly promote asymmetric A3&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, Cu(II)@CCOF@chitosan aerogel was fabricated as highly efficient fixed&#8208;bed model reactor for scaled&#8208;up catalysis. The concept of aminocatalytic asymmetric polymerization might open a new way for constructing the CCOFs via asymmetric organocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Nanoconfinement Reactor: Boosting Chemical Reactivity with Locally High Temperature in a Confined Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) system is proposed and demonstrated by using hollow carbon nanospheres (HCN) to enhance the performance of chemical reaction. Under light irradiation, the local temperature of HCN inner void space was much higher than the bulk solution temperature because the confined space concentrates heat and inhibits heat loss. Using a temperature sensitive model reaction, peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation to oxidize micropollutant, it is shown that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole in the PNCR system was 7.1 times of those without nanoconfinement. It is further discovered that the high&#8208;quality local heat inside the nanoconfined space shifted the model reaction from an otherwise non&#8208;radical pathway to a radical&#8208;based pathway in the presence of the confinement. This work provides an interesting strategy to produce locally high temperature which has a wide range of applications to energy and environmental fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzodiazapyracylenes: Doubly N&#8208;Doped Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Molecules That Exhibit High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrogen&#8208;doped CP&#8208;PAH, dibenzodiazapyracylene, was successfully synthesized and characterized. The aromatic and antiaromatic resonance hybrid characters have been verified by comparing their 1H&#8197;NMR spectra to those of reference molecules. Their condensed packing structures in the solid state allowed for the effective hole transporting.







Abstract
Pyracylene is a unique cyclopenta&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) that exhibits dual aromatic characteristics. Herein we report the synthesis of doubly N&#8208;doped benzannulated pyracylenes, namely dibenzodiazapyracylenes, by oxidative N&#8722;N linking reaction of [2.2](2,5)pyrrolophane&#8208;type precursors. Dibenzodiazapyracylenes displayed well&#8208;ordered &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular packing in the solid state, which were feasible for effective hole&#8208;transporting along the stacking direction. High carrier mobility was estimated by microwave conductivity measurements as compared to dibenzoullazine. The high HOMO level of dibenzodiazapyracylene was verified by electrochemistry and its persistent radical cation species has been detected.

         <title>Regulation of High Miscibility for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transport in n&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High host&#8208;dopant miscibility and excellent carrier mobility can be simultaneously achieved in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. High&#8208;mobility polymers usually possess poor miscibility because of strong interchain interactions. Without harming the efficient charge&#8208;transport based on the ordered polymer backbones packing, disordered side&#8208;chains are introduced to accommodate dopants better without disturbing charge&#8208;transport pathways.







Abstract
Strong interchain interactions of conjugated polymers usually result in poor miscibility with molecular dopants, limiting the doping efficiency because of uncontrolled phase separation. We have developed a strategy to achieve efficient charge&#8208;transport and high doping miscibility in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. We solve the miscibility issue through disorder side&#8208;chains containing dopants better. Systemic structural characterization reveals a farther side&#8208;chain branching point will lead to higher disorders, which provides appropriate sites to accommodate extrinsic molecular dopants without harming original chain packings and charge&#8208;transport channels. Therefore, better sustainability of solid&#8208;state microstructure is obtained, yielding a stable conductivity even when overloading massive dopants. This work highlights the importance of realizing high host&#8208;dopant miscibility in molecular doping of conjugated polymers.

         <title>Record Aluminum Molecular Rings for Optical Limiting and Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach to generate the largest aluminum molecular rings is presented. Their nonlinear optics (NLO) and optical limiting (OL) performance is studied by the Z&#8208;scan technique. The results provide insights to understand the NLO structure&#8211;activity relationship and tune the NLO performance at a molecular level.







Abstract
Crystalline cluster materials, a class of functional motif aggregations, provide a great opportunity for tuning the properties stemming from the flexible and accurate variation of inorganic and organic compositions. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2&#215;9 and 3&#215;6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0&#8197;nm to 1.7&#8197;nm. The picosecond Z&#8208;scan measurements results revealed that the third&#8208;order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics.

In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0&#8197;nm to 1.7&#8197;nm. The picosecond Z-scan measurements results revealed that the third-order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Single&#8208;Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tannic acid coating method, a series of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic single&#8208;atom coatings (SACs) (e.&#8201;g., Co, Fe, Mn, Co&#8722;Mn, Fe&#8722;Mn) can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon cloth, SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm).







Abstract
Here, we report a universal single&#8208;atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self&#8208;assemble into a cross&#8208;linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon, SiO2, TiO2, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal&#8211;dopamine complexes or metal&#8211;organic frameworks. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on graphene and TiO2 were prepared. The former one shows six&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to the high activity of the single atoms and the formation of the single&#8208;atom coating&#8211;TiO2 heterojunction.

         <title>Flexible Soft&#8208;Solid Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel flexible soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes were developed on commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrates. The quasi&#8208;vertically oriented, solid Zn2(benzimidazolate)4 particles grown on the PVDF substrate provided predominant molecular sieving gas entrances, while the soft polyamide eliminated defects enclosing MOF particles, resulting in a superior H2/CO2 separation factor which far exceeded those of MOF&#8208;based membranes reported to date.







Abstract
The development of a facile strategy to construct defect&#8208;free and flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes with high selectivity and good scalability holds great appeal. Here we report the fabrication of soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes on polyvinylidene fluoride substrates. A representative membrane comprised of quasi&#8208;vertically grown lamellar Zn2(Bim)4 (Bim=benzimidazolate) and lateral ultrathin polyamide film adhering to the MOF side facets. The straight interlayer galleries within unwrapped Zn2(Bim)4 acted as predominant pathways, while the polyamide served the function of defect elimination, synergistically inducing an unprecedented H2/CO2 selectivity of 1084 which set a new record for MOF&#8208;based membranes. Separation performance was held constant after membrane rolling up into a tube with a diameter of 3&#8197;mm or folding and unfolding at 90&#176; for 50 times. ZIF&#8208;67 and ZIF&#8208;8 composite membranes based on this strategy also realized extremely high H2/CO2 separation accuracies. These results, which demonstrate the intrinsic molecular sieving capability of MOFs, will promote the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes in practical separation applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Metal Electrodeposition Revealed by In Situ Optical Imaging and Theoretical Modeling towards Fast&#8208;Charging Zn Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast metal electrodeposition in fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries was investigated by in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling. The critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode were uncovered, guided by which a highly reversible Zn metal electrode in an aqueous battery with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is a preferred anode material for rechargeable aqueous batteries towards a smart grid and renewable energy storage. Understanding how the metal nucleates and grows at the aqueous Zn anode is a critical and challenging step to achieve full reversibility of Zn battery chemistry, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, by combining in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling, we uncover the critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode, that is, the competition among crystallographic thermodynamics, kinetics, and Zn2+&#8208;ion diffusion. Moreover, steady&#8208;state Zn metal plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% is achieved at 10&#8211;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a reasonably high concentration (3&#8197;M) ZnSO4 electrolyte. Significantly, a long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stable Zn metal electrode is realized with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in both Zn||Zn symmetrical cells and MnO2||Zn full cells.

Multifunctional microrobots, made of Ni@Pt microrockets, CdS quantum dots, and a host &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin selector, have been engineered that simultaneously exhibit i) self&#8208;propulsion, ii)&#8197;fluorescence, and iii)&#8197;magnetic properties in combination with iv) supramolecular chiral recognition for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; approaches. As a model chiral target, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated using a bimodal (optical and electrical) readout.







Abstract
Herein, a general procedure for the synthesis of multifunctional MRs, which simultaneously exhibit i) chiral, ii)&#8197;magnetic, and iii)&#8197;fluorescent properties in combination with iv) self&#8208;propulsion, is reported. Self&#8208;propelled Ni@Pt superparamagnetic microrockets have been functionalized with fluorescent CdS quantum dots carrying a chiral host biomolecule as &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; chiral recognition potential of MRs has been interrogated by taking advantage of the &#946;&#8208;CD affinity to supramolecularly accommodate different chiral biomolecules (i.e., amino acids). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated with a dual&#8208;mode (optical and electrochemical) readout. This approach paves the way to devise intelligent cargo micromachines with &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral supramolecular recognition capabilities to elucidate the concept of &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221;, which might be facilely customized by tailoring the supramolecular host&#8211;guest encapsulation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with EQE of 32.8&#8201;% and Extremely Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using asymmetric peripheral protection as a design motif, two high efficiency and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials were designed and synthesized. The corresponding device exhibits pure green emission with a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 32.8&#8201;% and relatively low efficiency roll&#8208;off without utilizing any sensitizer.







Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters show great potentials for high color purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the simultaneous realization of high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel asymmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitter (2Cz&#8208;PTZ&#8208;BN) is designed that fully inherits the high PLQY and large kRISC values of the properly selected parent molecules. The resonating extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton with peripheral protection can achieve a high PLQY of 96&#8201;% and a fast kRISC of above 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and boost the performance of corresponding pure green devices with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.8&#8201;% without utilizing any sensitizing hosts. Remarkably, the device sufficiently maintains a high EQE exceeding 23&#8201;% at a high luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the highest value for reported green MR&#8208;TADF materials at the same luminescence.

         <title>A Descriptor for Accurate Predictions of Host Molecules Enabling Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor &#916;E was developed based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism, allowing accurate predictions of organic host&#8211;guest phosphorescent systems.







Abstract
Although doping can induce room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom free organic systems, it is often challenging to match the host and guest components to achieve efficient intersystem crossing for activating RTP. In this work, we developed a simple descriptor &#916;E to predict host molecules for matching the guest RTP emitters, based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism. This descriptor successfully predicted five commercially available host components to pair with naphthalimide (NA) and naphtho[2,3&#8208;c]furan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione (2,3&#8208;NA) emitters with a high accuracy of 83&#8201;%. The yielded pairs exhibited bright yellow and green RTP with the quantum efficiency up to 0.4 and lifetime up to 1.67&#8197;s, respectively. Using these RTP pairs, we successfully achieved multi&#8208;layer message encryption. The &#916;E descriptor could provide an efficient way for developing doping&#8208;induced RTP materials.

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Computationally Guided Synthesis of SSZ&#8208;43: A One&#8208;Dimensional 12&#8208;Ring Zeolite with Unique Sinusoidal Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
After two decades since its discovery, the structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 has been determined as a novel framework comprised of a primitive orthorhombic crystal system with monoclinic faulting that forms unique, 1D 12&#8208;ring sinusoidal channels. A combination of molecular modeling and empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity was used to design two new di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and produce SSZ&#8208;43 across a wide range of high SiO2 compositions.







Abstract
The structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 was determined by 3D electron diffraction, synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SSZ&#8208;43 framework forms one&#8208;dimensional, sinusoidal 12&#8208;ring channels from 5461 butterfly units commonly found in other zeolites, but with unique 6.5&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; apertures and 12&#8208;ring 6.5&#215;8.9&#8197;&#197; windows perpendicular to the channels. SSZ&#8208;43 crystals are intergrowths of two polytypes: &#8776;90&#8201;% orthorhombic polytype A with ABAB stacking of the 12&#8208;rings, and &#8776;10&#8201;% monoclinic polytype B with ABCABC stacking. Molecular modeling performed on the idealized Si&#8208;SSZ&#8208;43 structure along with empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity in boron&#8208; and aluminum&#8208;containing synthesis gels were used in a combined approach to design new di&#8208;quaternary ammonium organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs). Experimental trials demonstrated that the new OSDAs produced SSZ&#8208;43 over a broader range of compositions than previous mono&#8208;quaternary OSDAs.

         <title>Peptoid&#8208;Directed Formation of Five&#8208;Fold Twinned Au Nanostars through Particle Attachment and Facet Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the easy manipulation of peptoid&#8211;peptoid and peptoid&#8211;particle interactions solely by the variation of side chain chemistry, peptoid&#8208;induced formation of five&#8208;fold twinned Au star&#8208;shaped particles exhibiting five regular points has been achieved through a process of repeated particle attachment followed by facet stabilization.







Abstract
While bio&#8208;inspired synthesis offers great potential for controlling nucleation and growth of inorganic particles, precisely tuning biomolecule&#8211;particle interactions is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we used variations in peptoid sequence to manipulate peptoid&#8211;Au interactions, leading to the synthesis of concave five&#8208;fold twinned, five&#8208;pointed Au nanostars via a process of repeated particle attachment and facet stabilization. Ex situ and liquid&#8208;phase TEM observations show that a balance between particle attachment biased to occur near the star points, preferential growth along the [100] direction, and stabilization of (111) facets is critical to forming star&#8208;shaped particles. Molecular simulations predict that interaction strengths between peptoids and distinct Au facets differ significantly and thus can alter attachment kinetics and surface energies to form the stars. This work provides new insights into how sequence&#8208;defined ligands affect particle growth to regulate crystal morphology.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed triborylation of unactivated alkenes is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and xantphos. Mechanistic studies reveal that this triborylation reaction proceeds through three interdependent catalytic cycles.







Abstract
The structural diversity of sp3&#8208;triorganometallic reagents enhances their potentiality in the modular construction of molecular complexity in chemical synthesis. Despite significant achievements on the preparation of sp3 1,1,1&#8208; and 1,1,2&#8208;triorganometallic B,B,B&#8208;reagents, catalytic approaches that enable the installation of multiple boryl groups at skipped carbons of unactivated alkenes still remain elusive. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective triborylation reaction of unactivated alkenes to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes. This triborylation protocol provides a general platform for regioselective trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes, and its utility is highlighted by the synthesis of various value&#8208;added chemicals from readily accessible unactivated alkenes. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and evaluation of potential reactive intermediates, provide insight into the experimentally observed chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;A regioselective cobalt-catalyzed triborylation of unactivated alkenes is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3-triborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from Co(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and xantphos. Mechanistic studies reveal that this triborylation reaction proceeds through three interdependent catalytic cycles.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold can be dissolved in a sustainable manner with common household chemicals: iodine solution in ethanol, resembling diluted iodine tincture, green oxidant hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, a compound used in medicinal applications. Catalytic reactions and green solvents are the basis for sustainable development and recycling of precious metals like gold.







Abstract
Gold is a scarce element in the Earth's crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco&#8208;social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I2 oxidizes Au0 and forms a [AuII2]&#8722; species, which undergoes subsequent ligand&#8208;exchange reactions and forms a stable bis&#8208;ligand AuI complex. H2O2 oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I2 returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Variable Oxygen Affinity for Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;support interaction between Pt and CoOx creates a strong built&#8208;in electric field across the interface and modulates the charge distribution. This electric field subtly optimizes both the hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy, boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral media.







Abstract
Work function strongly impacts the surficial charge distribution, especially for metal&#8208;support electrocatalysts when a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is constructed. Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoOx electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5&#8208;fold mass activity higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.

         <title>Main&#8208;Chain Fluoropolymers with Alternating Sequence Control via Light&#8208;Driven Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Copolymerization in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;enabled controlled copolymerization compatible with both batch and flow syntheses has been established for the transformation of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides. This work enables on&#8208;demand preparation of main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers with various fractions of alternating units under ambient conditions, and streamlines the generation of block copolymers from gaseous fluoroethylene using two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow systems.







Abstract
Polymers with regulated alternating structures are attractive in practical applications, particularly for main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers. We for the first time enabled controlled fluoropolymer synthesis with alternating sequence regulation using a novel fluorinated xanthate agent via a light&#8208;driven process, which achieved on&#8208;demand copolymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides under both batch and flow conditions at ambient pressure. This method creates a facile access to fluoropolymers with a broad fraction range of alternating units, low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow platform was established to streamline the in&#8208;situ chain&#8208;extension toward unprecedented block copolymers continuously from fluoroethylene. Influences of structural control were illustrated with thermal and surface properties. We anticipate that this work will promote advanced material engineering with customized fluoropolymers.

         <title>Millisecond&#8208;Range Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes.







Abstract
Probes featuring room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time&#8208;resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging generally ranges around the microsecond level, because of the short&#8208;lived emission. Herein, the first example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo&#8208;(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;AspD&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Cys)&#8208;conjugated zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres), with a RTP emission lasting for &#8776;5&#8197;s and a lifetime as long as 743.7&#8197;ms. We demonstrate that live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune&#8208;phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) value of &#8776;69 for in vitro imaging, and &#8776;627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8197;times.

An artificial enzyme that responds to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was designed through introducing a catalytic histidine residue at one of the thiols of pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). The artificial enzyme could in&#8197;situ cross&#8208;link to form an assembled structure that could trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of pro&#8208;fluorophore and activate the turn&#8208;on fluorescence inside cancer cells for selective diagnosis.







Abstract
Inside living cells, regulation of catalytic activity of artificial enzymes remains challenging due to issues such as biocompatibility, efficiency, and stability of the catalyst, by which the practical applications of artificial enzymes have been severely hindered. Here, an artificial enzyme, PTT&#8208;SGH, with responsiveness to reactive oxygen species (ROS), was obtained by introducing a catalytic histidine residue to pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PTT). The artificial enzyme formed large aggregates in cells via the intracellular ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation of thiol groups. The process was significantly facilitated in tumor cells because of the higher ROS concentration in the tumor microenvironment. The catalytic activity of this artificial enzyme was intensively enhanced through deprotonation of cross&#8208;linked PTT&#8208;SGH, which showed typical esterase activities. Selective fluorescence imaging of tumor cells was achieved using the artificial enzyme to trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of the caged fluorophore inside living cells.

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When polymer chains are stressed in solution, mechanochemistry is accelerated if helical conformations are present in the chain, as measured using a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography and the use of rhodamine mechanophore activation. This phenomenon is explained by the increased persistence length in helical polymers, leading to more efficient energy transduction.







Abstract
Polymer chains, if long enough, are known to undergo bond scission when mechanically stressed. While the mechanochemical response of random coils is well understood, biopolymers and some key synthetic chains adopt well&#8208;defined secondary structures such as helices. To understand covalent mechanochemistry in such structures, poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamates) are prepared while regulating the feed&#8208;monomer chirality, producing chains with similar molecular weights and backbone chemistry but different helicities. Such chains are stressed in solution and their mechanochemistry rates compared by following molecular weight change and using a rhodamine mechanochromophore. Results reveal that while helicity itself is not affected by the covalent bond scissions, chains with higher helicity undergo faster mechanochemistry. Considering that the polymers tested differ only in conformation, these results indicate that helix&#8208;induced chain rigidity improves the efficiency of mechanical energy transduction.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Heteroaromatics with Prolonged Homogeneous Hexatomic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red multi&#8208;resonance emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yields and narrowband emission were demonstrated by introducing homogeneous hexatomic rings into nitrogen&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting devices afforded state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with external quantum efficiency up to 18.2&#8201;% and superior operation stability.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic heteroaromatics have exhibited fascinating multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics for efficient narrowband emission, but strategies to bathochromic shift their emissions while maintaining the narrow bandwidths remain exclusive. Here, homogeneous hexatomic rings are introduced into nitrogen&#8208;embedded MR skeletons to prolong the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length for low&#8208;energy electronic transitions while retaining the non&#8208;bonding character of the remaining parts. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters exhibit near unity photoluminescence quantum yields with peaks at 598&#8197;nm and 620&#8197;nm and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximums of 28&#8197;nm and 31&#8197;nm, respectively. Optimal organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 18.2&#8201;%, negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, and ultra&#8208;long lifetime with negligible degradation at an initial luminance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 after 94&#8197;hours.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel pH/enzyme dual&#8208;activatable nanoplatform (ZIF@DG) was developed via in&#8197;situ encapsulation of therapeutics into a zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;8, combined with microfluidics&#8208;assisted preparation of a DG polymer coating. The nanoplatform can co&#8208;deliver the protein drug ribonuclease A and the small&#8208;molecule drug doxorubicin with controlled drug release to deep tumor regions for synergistic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics. In&#8197;vivo results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with a synergistic anticancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia&#8208;triggered platinum supernanoparticles dissociated into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters, which could be cleared by the kidney through urine, in response to the tumor microenvironment. After collection of the excreted nanosensors, the disease status was monitored visually and quantitatively by using a microfluidic chip.







Abstract
Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar&#8208;chart chip (V&#8208;Chip) for point&#8208;of&#8208;care analysis. The V&#8208;Chip signals of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow&#8208;up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Reveals Sex Difference in Vesicular Storage and Release of Catecholamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical quantitative measurements of vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level reveal a sex difference in transmitter release during exocytosis, which might relate to the sex difference of the expression level of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. This research provides a new perspective to understand sex dimorphism in exocytosis.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of sex difference in vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level are essential to understand sex differences in cognitive behaviors; however, such measurements are very challenging to conventional analytical methods. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the duration of single exocytotic events of chromaffin cells prepared from male rats is statistically longer than that from female rats, leading to more neurotransmitter released in the male group. Further analysis reveals that a higher percentage of vesicles in the female group release part of the neurotransmitter, i.e., partial release, during exocytosis than that in male group. This sex dimorphism in neurotransmitter release in exocytosis might relate to the sex difference in the expression of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. Our finding offers the first experimental evidence that sex dimorphism even exists in vesicle chemistry, providing a brand new viewpoint for understanding the sex dimorphism in exocytosis.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Nanoagents Based on Lanthanide Nucleotide Self&#8208;Assemblies toward Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled lanthanide nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with tunable size (4.6&#8211;105.7&#8197;nm) are developed by employing nanomicelles as a template. High&#8208;resolution spectra at 10&#8197;K are provided for the first time to unravel the local site symmetry of Ln3+ inside the LNNPs. The ultrasmall DOX@LNNPs can achieve rapid renal clearance and unique tumor accumulation, thus enabling efficient tumor&#8208;specific therapy with negligible long&#8208;term toxicity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoagents, which simultaneously satisfy normal tissue clearance and tumor&#8208;specific responsive treatment, are highly attractive for precise cancer theranostics. Herein, we develop a unique template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy for the exquisitely controlled synthesis of self&#8208;assembled lanthanide (Ln3+) nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with amorphous structure and tunable size from sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm to 105&#8197;nm. By virtue of the low&#8208;temperature (10&#8197;K) and high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, the local site symmetry of Ln3+ in LNNPs is unraveled for the first time. The proposed LNNPs are further demonstrated to possess the ability for highly efficient loading and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive release of doxorubicin. Particularly, sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm LNNPs not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility and predominant renal&#8208;clearance performance, but also enable efficient tumor retention. These findings reveal the great potential of LNNPs as a new generation of therapeutic platform to overcome the dilemma between efficient therapy and long&#8208;term toxicity of nanoagents for future clinical applications.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Membrane Based on Pillararene&#8208;Intercalated MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a series of inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanosheets based on pillararene&#8208;intercalated MXene nanosheets is reported, which have larger lateral size compared with the original MXene nanosheets, in which a membrane was formed through vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration. The as&#8208;prepared membranes exhibited relatively high water permeance, rejection, and stability for treating water containing antibiotics under dead&#8208;end filtration and cross&#8208;flow filtration conditions.







Abstract
Discharge of antibiotic&#8208;containing wastewater causes environmental pollution and threatens biological and human health. An efficient treatment method for this wastewater is urgently required. We prepared inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXene&#8211;pillararene nanosheets with a large lateral size (5&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;m). The hybrid nanosheets were stacked on supports via vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration to prepare membranes with regular parallel slits and an interlayer spacing of 1.36&#8197;nm, which were used to purify antibiotic&#8208;containing water. Permeance through the membrane increased 100&#8208;fold compared with most polymeric and other two&#8208;dimensional nanofiltration membranes with similar rejection. This high permeance and rejection was attributed to the large lateral size of the nanosheets, regular interlayer spacing, and electrostatic interaction between the membrane and antibiotics. These membranes will broaden the applications of lamellar materials for the separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added drugs in academia and industry.

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>

Ru&#8208;SA (single atom)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant Mon+ species neighboring oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. More importantly, Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 by the effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+).







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency owing to localized electron deficiency. Herein, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ (4&lt;n&lt;6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (OV) are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 through the presence of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+). The Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H2, and Mon+ species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N2, finally leading to NH3 synthesis on Mon+&#8722;OH. The NH3 generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.

Ca&#8208;ion battery: Ascribed to the improved anion intercalation performance in the graphite cathode and reversible Ca2+ insertion in the organic anode, by combining a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated Ca&#8208;ion electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results for Ca&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage applications. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated electrolyte with a calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)2) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion of Ca2+ in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results known for CIBs.

         <title>Superlattice in a Ru Superstructure for Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets with a superlattice is reported and the significance of the superlattice on electrocatalysis is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice between the adjacent Ru layers can induce the strain effect, which leads to the lattice contraction and the weakening of the *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance.







Abstract
Superlattices are attracting extensive attention due to their unique properties. Nevertheless, the observations of superlattices are limited to those layered structures with weak interlayered interactions, and the effect of the superlattice in metal&#8208;based nanostructures on catalysis is unexplored yet. We here report a facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets (Ru MNSs) with a superlattice. Characterizations reveal that the superlattice is formed by stacking Ru layers with twisted angles from 2&#176; to 30&#176;. Owing to the strong synergy between the adjacent layers, Ru MNSs can serve as an efficient catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice can induce the strain effect, which leads to lattice contraction and weak *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance. This work sheds new light on the utilization of the superlattice on enhancing catalysis in metal&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Depositing Molecular Graphene Nanoribbons on Ag(111) by Electrospray Controlled Ion Beam Deposition: Self&#8208;Assembly and On&#8208;Surface Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons, deposited by electrospray controlled ion beam deposition, form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers after multiple chemical transformations employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols. These transformations and the nature of the metal&#8211;organic coordination motifs are investigated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy.







Abstract
The chemical processing of low&#8208;dimensional carbon nanostructures is crucial for their integration in future devices. Here we apply a new methodology in atomically precise engineering by combining multistep solution synthesis of N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with mass&#8208;selected ultra&#8208;high vacuum electrospray controlled ion beam deposition on surfaces and real&#8208;space visualisation by scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate how this method yields solely a controllable amount of single, otherwise unsublimable, GNRs of 2.9&#8197;nm length on a planar Ag(111) surface. This methodology allows for further processing by employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols and exploiting the reactivity of the substrate. Following multiple chemical transformations, the GNRs provide reactive building blocks to form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers.

         <title>Tailoring a Near&#8208;Infrared Macrocyclization Scaffold Allows the Control of In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly for Photoacoustic/PET Bimodal Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore was tailored as a PAI&#8208;active macrocyclization scaffold for controlling macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly, which enabled the development of a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PET/PAI bimodal probe [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 for noninvasive imaging of drug&#8208;induced tumor apoptosis in vivo, with potential for the early monitoring of tumor response to chemotherapy.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;triggered macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of small molecules into nanoparticles has shown promise to design activatable probes for molecular imaging. However, controlling macrocyclization and self&#8208;assembly to concurrently augment positron emission tomography (PET) and photoacoustic (PA) signals for bimodality imaging is challenging. Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self&#8208;assembly and design a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PA/PET bimodal probe ([18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high&#8208;sensitivity whole&#8208;body imaging signals offered by PET with the high&#8208;resolution imaging signals offered by PA, [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful for optimizing the therapeutic protocol for patients. This scaffold may be adopted to design other activatable bimodal probes for in vivo imaging.

         <title>Molecular and Spin Structures of a Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Triradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formally equilateral triradical with D3h symmetry is subject to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion to create two distorted C2v structures (i.e., acute and obtuse forms) and these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted in the solution and solid states.







Abstract
A through&#8208;space conjugated multi&#8208;phenalenyl triradical 1&#8201;a has been prepared and characterized. Partial occupancy of doubly degenerate molecular orbitals in 1&#8201;a leads to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, creating a molecular skeleton in which C2v doublet states are lower in energy than undistorted D3h doublet and quartet states. Triradical 1&#8201;a exists in an acute form in the solution state, whereas it adopts a preferred obtuse form in the solid state. The results of the investigation show that these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted by thermal energy.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylcyanation of Ynamides: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Access to Tetrasubstituted 3&#8208;Silyl&#8208;2&#8208;Aminoacrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles (&#945;&#8208;enaminonitriles) are underinvestigated building blocks due to the lack of methodologies to synthesize them in a controlled manner. A general access to these valuable scaffolds accompanied by mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations is described. This highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective strategy relies on the use of the first intermolecular silylcyanation of ynamides.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed silylcyanation of ynamides is described. This reaction is fully regioselective, delivering tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles derivatives exclusively. Unexpectedly, the nature (aryl or alkyl) of the substituent located at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide directly controls the stereoselectivity. The reaction tolerates a number of functional groups and can be considered as the first general access to fully substituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles. Given the singular reactivity observed, a computational study was performed to shed light on the mechanism of this intriguing transformation. Relying on the specific reactivity of the newly installed vinylsilane functionality, the scope of 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles has been enlarged by postfunctionalization.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Induced Nanocrystalline Domain Engineering and Surface Passivation in Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through plasma&#8208;enabled post&#8208;treatment technology, a constant elastic collision with a large surface area generates periodic lattice vibration at a high potential difference, thereby rearranging the lattice along the electrically preferred direction. Nanocrystallinity of the semiconductor film is dramatically improved through the rearrangement of lattice, and thus the optoelectric properties of the materials are greatly enhanced.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous materials is key to realizing high&#8208;performance chemical and biological sensors and optoelectronics. However, minimizing surface oxidation and enhancing the domain size without affecting the porous nanoarchitecture are daunting challenges. Herein, we report a hybrid technique that combines bottom&#8208;up electrochemical growth with top&#8208;down plasma treatment to produce mesoporous semiconductors with large crystalline domain sizes and excellent surface passivation. By passivating unsaturated bonds without incorporating any chemical or physical layers, these films show better stability and enhancement in the optoelectronic properties of mesoporous copper telluride (CuTe) with different pore diameters. These results provide exciting opportunities for the development of long&#8208;term, stable, and high&#8208;performance mesoporous semiconductor materials for future technologies.

         <title>Carboxyl Methyltransferase Catalysed Formation of Mono&#8208; and Dimethyl Esters under Aqueous Conditions: Application in Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carboxyl methyltransferase FtpM can catalyse methylation and dimethylation of a wide range of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids, showing high regioselectivity for some diacids. The enzymatic methylation works under aqueous conditions and can therefore be integrated into enzyme cascades as demonstrated by the two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot conversion of bioderived HMF to bioplastics precursor FDME.







Abstract
Carboxyl methyltransferase (CMT) enzymes catalyse the biomethylation of carboxylic acids under aqueous conditions and have potential for use in synthetic enzyme cascades. Herein we report that the enzyme FtpM from Aspergillus fumigatus can methylate a broad range of aromatic mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids in good to excellent conversions. The enzyme shows high regioselectivity on its natural substrate fumaryl&#8208;l&#8208;tyrosine, trans, trans&#8208;muconic acid and a number of the dicarboxylic acids tested. Dicarboxylic acids are generally better substrates than monocarboxylic acids, although some substituents are able to compensate for the absence of a second acid group. For dicarboxylic acids, the second methylation shows strong pH dependency with an optimum at pH&#8197;5.5&#8211;6. Potential for application in industrial biotechnology was demonstrated in a cascade for the production of a bioplastics precursor (FDME) from bioderived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecule Based High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Organic Material for Efficient Water Purification and Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An umbrella&#8208;like donor&#8208;acceptor system (GDPA&#8208;QCN) based on a bulky dendritic donor (umbrella head) and a liner heterocyclic acceptor (umbrella handle) has been developed. GDPA&#8208;QCN shows strong sunlight absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion properties in the solid state and was employed to fabricate a high&#8208;performance water purification and electricity generation system.







Abstract
In this contribution, a unique donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal material, namely GDPA&#8208;QCN, is presented. Bulky dendritic triphenylamine (GDPA) was grafted onto quinoxaline&#8208;6,7&#8208;dicarbonitrile (QCN) with a phenyl ring as a bridge to form an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; architecture. Benefited from the particular molecular structure, in solid state, GDPA&#8208;QCN molecules adopted a loose packing mode due to the steric effect of &#8220;umbrella head&#8221; dendritic triphenylamine and flexible molecular structure feature, which allows efficient intramolecular motions and consequently elevates energy dissipation by taking the pathway of thermal deactivation within broad absorption range. The GDPA&#8208;QCN solid has high solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with an absorption range from 300 to 1100&#8197;nm, which can promote superior water purification and electricity generation performance.

         <title>Mapping the Morphological Landscape of Oligomeric Di&#8208;block Peptide&#8211;Polymer Amphiphiles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomeric di&#8208;block peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) provide a modular platform for sophisticated higher&#8208;order assembly, but tools to predict assembly behavior from molecular structure are limited. By systematically characterizing PPAs composed of oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random coil peptides, we outline general design principles of PPAs showing how oligomer length, dispersity, and peptide hydrophilicity impact the morphological distribution.







Abstract
Peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) are tunable hybrid materials that achieve complex assembly landscapes by combining the sequence&#8208;dependent properties of peptides with the structural diversity of polymers. Despite their promise as biomimetic materials, determining how polymer and peptide properties simultaneously affect PPA self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. We herein present a systematic study of PPA structure&#8211;assembly relationships. PPAs containing oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random&#8208;coil peptides were used to determine the role of oligomer molecular weight, dispersity, peptide length, and charge density on self&#8208;assembly. We observed that PPAs predominantly formed spheres rather than anisotropic particles. Oligomer molecular weight and peptide hydrophilicity dictated morphology, while dispersity and peptide charge affected particle size. These key benchmarks will facilitate the rational design of PPAs that expand the scope of biomimetic functionality within assembled soft materials.

         <title>Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) as a Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Scaffold with a Minimal Structure and High Density of Functionalizable Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) is proposed as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA as a molecular scaffold was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands.







Abstract
Functionalizable synthetic molecules with nanometer sizes and defined shapes in water are useful as molecular scaffolds to mimic the functions of biomacromolecules and develop chemical tools for manipulating biomacromolecules. Herein, we propose oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Oligo&#8208;NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;&#8208;carbons of oligo&#8208;NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo&#8208;NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.

Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;-carbons of oligo-NMA.

Unravelling the mechanism &#160;of charge accumulation and utilization in the light&#8208;driven carbon dioxide reduction using iron porphyrins bearing hydrogen bonding scaffolds revealed unprecedented puzzle pieces about its rate limiting step. While the formal Fe(0) redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, Zakaria Halime, Ally Aukauloo et&#8197;al. show in their Communication (e202117530) that the Fe(I) species is already involved in the substrate activation of the photocatalytic cycle.

Solution polymer mechanochemistry is well understood in random coil morphology. In their Research Article (e202115325), Charles&#8197;E. Diesendruck and Hang Zhang assess covalent mechanochemistry when &#945;&#8208;helices are present in covalent macromolecules. Poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamate)s (PBG) with different helicities are prepared by tuning the enantiomeric excess of the feed monomer. Ultrasonication is used to induce solvodynamic shear, leading to the scission of the polymer into smaller helices.

Gold is a valuable metal that can be dissolved with common household chemicals as reported by Timo Repo&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;in their Research Article (e202117587). By applying catalytic iodine, aqueous hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, gold promptly dissolves in ethanol.

Self&#8208;propulsion multifunctional microrobots harboring chiral supramolecular selectors represent a promising pathway for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; while employing different readouts (e.g., optical and electrical). The combination of different active compounds in a single architecture allows for a multifunctional microrobot that simultaneously exhibits chiral recognition, but also fluorescent properties and the ability to be magnetically navigable and propelled in the presence of a chemical fuel, as described by Martin Pumera and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202116090).

         <title>Inter&#8208;relationships between Oxygen Evolution and Iridium Dissolution Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage of excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen depends on the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and thus the rational design of novel iridium&#8208;based catalysts with improved electrocatalytic properties. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand both the OER and dissolution mechanisms as well as their inter&#8208;relationship. This Minireview gathers state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information of these phenomena on different Ir catalysts.







Abstract
The widespread utilization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers currently remains uncertain, as they rely on the use of highly scarce iridium as the only viable catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is known to present the major energy losses of the process. Understanding the mechanistic origin of the different activities and stabilities of Ir&#8208;based catalysts is, therefore, crucial for a scale&#8208;up of green hydrogen production. It is known that structure influences the dissolution, which is the main degradation mechanism and shares common intermediates with the OER. In this Minireview, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of dissolution and its relationship with the structure of different iridium catalysts is gathered and correlated to different mechanisms of the OER. A perspective on future directions of investigation is also given.

         <title>The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic fluorophores in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) range have been validated as attractive imaging tools in biomedical research owing to their biocompatibility, flexible chemical structure, and tunable spectra. This Review systematically summarizes recent advances in the chemistry, design principles, and optical properties of NIR&#8208;II organic contrast agents.







Abstract
Optical imaging, especially fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, is a non&#8208;invasive imaging approach with high spatial and temporal resolution and high sensitivity, compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the merits of imaging using the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, like deeper penetration depth, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, high resolution, and low tissue damage, researchers have devoted great effort to developing contrast agents with NIR&#8208;II absorption or emission. In this Review, we summarize recently developed organic luminescent and photoacoustic materials, ranging from small molecules to conjugated polymers. Then, we systematically introduce engineering strategies and describe the imaging performance classified by the skeleton cores. Finally, we elucidate the challenges and prospects of these NIR&#8208;II organic dyes for potential clinical applications. We expect our summary can inspire researchers to expand the spectrum of NIR&#8208;II contrast agents for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Operando Imaging of Chemical Activity on Gold Plates with Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship is of crucial importance to the evaluation and the rational design of novel catalysts. Herein, single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is employed for super&#8208;resolution mapping of the chemical activity and kinetic analysis of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;based reactions on single gold plates, which enables spatiotemporal characterizations down to the single&#8208;reaction level.







Abstract
Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemical techniques are thus in high demand. Here, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)32+ based reactions on Au plates using single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy. By converting electrochemical signals into optical signals, we manage to achieve the ultimate sensitivity of single&#8208;entity chemistry, that is directly resolving the single photons from individual electrochemical reactions. High spatial resolution, up to 37&#8197;nm, further enables mapping Au chemical activity and the reaction kinetics. The spatiotemporally resolved dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationship on Au plates shows that the restructuring of catalysts plays an important role in determining the reactivity. Our approach may lead to gaining new insights towards evaluating and designing electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally high performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photocatalytic reduction displayed by an iron&#8211;porphyrin bearing urea groups in the second coordination sphere is the result of the interaction of CO2 with the catalyst prior to the occurrence of the second electron uptake in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the best molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Powering these catalysts with the help of photosensitizers comes along with a couple of unsolved challenges that need to be addressed with much vigor. We have designed an iron porphyrin catalyst decorated with urea functions (UrFe) acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding scaffold towards the CO2 substrate. We found a spectacular photocatalytic activity reaching unreported TONs and TOFs as high as 7270 and 3720&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. While the Fe0 redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, we show here that the FeI species is already involved in the CO2 activation, which represents the rate&#8208;determining step in the photocatalytic cycle. The urea functions help to dock the CO2 upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations bring support to our experimental findings that constitute a new paradigm in the catalytic reduction of CO2.

         <title>Origin of High Diastereoselectivity in Reactions of Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselective reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates have been systematically investigated. Diastereoselectivity was found to be general for &#1013;&#8208;lactams, &#1013;&#8208;lactones, and cycloheptanones with various substituent patterns. Computational investigations provided insight into the origin of the diastereoselectivity. A model for predicting the stereochemistry of seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolate alkylations is proposed.







Abstract
Unlike many reactions of their six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring counterparts, the reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates are highly diastereoselective. Diastereoselectivity was observed for a range of substrates, including lactam, lactone, and cyclic ketone derivatives. The stereoselectivity arises from torsional and steric interactions that develop when electrophiles approach the diastereotopic &#960;&#8208;faces of the enolates, which are distinguished by subtle differences in the orientation of nearby atoms of the ring.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 was proven to be an effective radical precursor under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The metalloid nature of Ge allows single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) at the neutral Ge center and leads to advantages in separation and derivatization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, in particular alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, another proposal is reported by using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 shows comparable activity to that of Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722; and Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.

         <title>Reversible One&#8208; to Two&#8208; to Three&#8208;Dimensional Transformation in CuII Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible multi&#8208;dimensional transformation of a coordination polymer composed of CuII ions and terephthalate ligands was achieved for the first time by controlling the coordination environment. The dimensional transformation led to significant changes in the chemical and physical properties specific to coordination polymers, such as gas sorption and magnetism.







Abstract
A reversible transformation between 1D, 2D, and 3D is demonstrated for the first time in coordination polymers comprising CuII ions and bidentate terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;). 1D uniform chains were reversibly transformed into 2D layers with the construction of Cu&#8208;paddlewheels by eliminating water molecules. 2D/3D reversible transformation was achieved by removing/rebinding N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide coordinated to the paddlewheels. These dimensional transformations significantly changed chemical and physical properties such as gas sorption and magnetism. Although the uptake in open&#8208;framework 1D and 2D Cu&#8208;BDC was insignificant, pronounced absorption was observed for 3D Cu&#8208;BDC. Drastic difference in magnetic behavior is consistent with their coordination structures; uniform 1D chain of CuII in 1D Cu&#8208;BDC and 2D sheet based on CuII&#8208;paddlewheel dimers in 2D Cu&#8208;BDC. Ferromagnetic behavior observed in air&#8208;exposed 3D Cu&#8208;BDC is attributed to the 3D structure formed by the connection of 2D sheets.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by a Dual&#8208;Function Cobalt Catalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles is reported, which employs an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. The method is characterized by its excellent functional group tolerance, substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes, and scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) with a low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv).







Abstract
The direct functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds with nucleophiles minimizes pre&#8208;functionalization and converts inexpensive, abundantly available materials to value&#8208;added alkenyl&#8208;substituted products but remains challenging. Here we report an electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles employing an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. These C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through H2 evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv) and its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex structures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds with nucleophiles minimizes pre-functionalization and converts inexpensive, abundantly available materials to value-added alkenyl-substituted products but remains challenging. Here we report an electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles employing an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. These C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H cross-coupling reactions proceed through H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv) and its successful application in the late-stage functionalization of complex structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitchable Molecular Communication between Programmable DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Membraneless Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>

Photoswitchable bi&#8208;directional trafficking of biomolecules between programmable DNA&#8208;based artificial membraneless organelles in a cell&#8208;like microcompartment has been achieved to imitate intracellular communication towards construction of advanced functional artificial cells.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal organization of distinct biological processes in cytomimetic compartments is a crucial step towards engineering functional artificial cells. Mimicking controlled bi&#8208;directional molecular communication inside artificial cells remains a considerable challenge. Here we present photoswitchable molecular transport between programmable membraneless organelle&#8208;like DNA coacervates in a synthetic microcompartment. We use droplet microfluidics to fabricate membraneless non&#8208;fusing DNA coacervates by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet, and employ the interior DNA coacervates as artificial organelles to imitate intracellular communication via photo&#8208;regulated uni&#8208; and bi&#8208;directional transfer of biomolecules. Our results highlight a promising new route to assembly of multicompartment artificial cells with functional networks.

         <title>Cyclic Solid&#8208;State Multiple Phase Changes with Tuned Photoemission in a Gold Thiolate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;emissive amorphous AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer undergoes two successive crystallisation phase changes on mild solid&#8208;state heating. The first high symmetric crystalline phase becomes slightly red&#8208;emissive and the second, which has a lower symmetry, exhibits intense luminescence due to the presence of aurophilic interactions. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding, offering potential for non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
The discovery of a universal memory that exhibits fast access speed, high&#8208;density storage, and non&#8208;volatility has fuelled research into phase&#8208;change materials over the past decades. In spite of the efficiency of the inorganic chalcogenides for phase&#8208;change random access memory (PCRAM), they still have some inherent drawbacks, such as high temperature required for phase change and difficulty to control the domain size of the phase change, because of their brittleness. Here we present a AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer which undergoes two successive phase changes on application of mild heating (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) from amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline1&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline2 phases. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding. More importantly, each phase exhibits different photoluminescent properties for an efficient optical read&#8208;out. We believe that the ability of the AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer to have reversible phase changes under soft conditions and at the same time to display distinct optical signals, can pave the way for the next generation of PCRAM.

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of dialdehydes led to structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes in good yields, with high enantioselectivity enabled by unprecedented NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes followed by kinetic resolution. This protocol, which features mild reaction conditions and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance, provides modular access to value&#8208;added axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.







Abstract
Axially chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Macrocycle Conformer Ensembles and 13C&#8208;NMR Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum mechanical investigations of hydrocarbon macrocycle ensembles in solution by comparison of experimental and computed 13C&#8208;NMR spectra are described. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory allows the deduction of contributing molecular conformations.







Abstract
NMR as a routine analytical method provides important three&#8208;dimensional structure information of compounds in solution. Here we apply the recently released CRENSO computational workflow for the automated generation of conformer ensembles to the quantum mechanical calculation of 13C&#8208;NMR spectra of a series of flexible cycloalkanes up to C20H40. We evaluate the computed chemical shifts in comparison with corresponding experimental data in chloroform. It is shown that accurate and properly averaged theoretical NMR data can be obtained in about a day of computation time on a standard workstation computer. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables one to deduce preferred conformations of large, non&#8208;rigid macrocycles under ambient conditions from our automated procedure.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolution of High Mechanical Strength Dry&#8208;Network Polythiourethane Thermosets into Neat Macroscopic Hollow Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to obtain macroscopic hollow structures was developed involving a self&#8208;evolution process from dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermosets (PTUs) polymer films to neat hollow objects via immersion of aqueous NaOH solutions.







Abstract
Organism&#8208;inspired hollow structures are attracting increasing interest for the construction of various bionic functional hollow materials. Next&#8208;generation self&#8208;evolution hollow materials tend to combine simple synthesis, high mechanical strength, and regular shape. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermoset with excellent mechanical performance. The polymer film could evolve into a neat and well&#8208;organized object with a macroscopic hollow interior structure after being immersed in an aqueous NaOH solution. The self&#8208;evolution hollow structure originated from a hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network, which was later transformed into a network bearing both hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The swelling and thickness growth of this material could be controlled by the NaOH concentration and the immersion time. This unique self&#8208;evolution behavior was further utilized to produce a series of macroscopic 3D hollow&#8208;containing molds, which could be potentially applied in the production of smart materials.

         <title>Homogeneously Large Polarons in Aromatic Passivators Improves Charge Transport between Perovskite Grains for &gt;24&#8201;% Efficiency in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport behavior of two amine Cu porphyrin supramolecules with different stacking interactions in perovskite grain boundaries was investigated in detail. Results prove that the construction of homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in aromatic passivators is a key factor for the charge transport between perovskite grains. This work also affords a new strategy to design new optoelectronic materials with improved charge mobilities.







Abstract
Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;&#8208;backbones have attracted considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often self&#8208;assemble into supramolecules that probably influence the charge&#8208;transfer process in the perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the presence of a stronger interaction between the amine units and the central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules. This has a modified effect on the dipole direction of the porphyrins to be quantized as homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in a periodic lattice. The porphyrin supramolecules can stabilize perovskite grain boundaries to greatly improve the stability of PSCs, while the HLPs&#8208;featured supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grains to remarkably increase the cell performance to as high as 24.2&#8201;%. This work proves that the modulation of the intermolecular interaction of aromatic passivators to yield HLPs is crucial for the cascaded acceleration of charge transport between perovskite grains.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Recording of Fermentation and Lipid Metabolism Processes in Live Microalgae Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of solid&#8208;state MAS NMR on live microalgae for monitoring of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamics changes is demonstrated. Conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids is observed, accompanied with rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. It is concluded that high cell densities, creating dark, anoxia conditions, induce lipid catabolism and cell death resulting in breakdown of cell and organelle membranes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time recording of processes in living cells has been limited to detection of small cellular components such as soluble proteins and metabolites. Here we report a multiphase NMR approach using magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR to synchronously follow microbial processes of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamic changes in live microalgae cells. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii green algae were highly concentrated, introducing dark fermentation and anoxia conditions. Single&#8208;pulse NMR experiments were applied to obtain temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic profiles of the formed fermentation products. Through dynamics&#8208;based spectral editing NMR, simultaneous conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids was observed and rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. This suggests that lipolysis under dark and anoxia conditions finally results in the breakdown of cell and organelle membranes, which could be beneficial for recovery of intracellular microbial useful products.

         <title>Hybrid Elastic Organic Crystals that Respond to Aerial Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight, mechanically reinforced, hygroresponsive organic crystalline hybrid materials has been synthesized by a universally applicable approach. The crystals are robust, durable, and moisture&#8208;absorbing, and show a highly linear deformation over a wide range of relative humidity. Such precise spatiotemporal control over the light output in response to air humidity allows the materials to be used as optical waveguides.







Abstract
Reshaping of elongated organic crystals that can be used as semiconductors, waveguides or soft robotic grippers by application of force or light is now a commonplace, however mechanical response of organic crystals to changes in humidity has not been accomplished yet. Here, we report a universal approach to instigating a humidity response into elastically bendable organic crystals that elicits controllable deformation with linear response to aerial humidity while retaining their physical integrity entirely intact. Hygroresponsive bilayer elements are designed by mechanically coupling a humidity&#8208;responsive polymer with elastic molecular crystals that have been mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating. As an illustration of the application of these cladded crystalline actuators, they are tested as active optical transducers of visible light where the position of light output can be precisely controlled by variations in aerial humidity. Within a broader context, the approach described here provides access to a vast range of mechanically robust, lightweight hybrid hygroresponsive crystalline materials.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Nanolayer For Copper Film Oxidation Mitigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The wide use of copper is limited by rapid oxidation, which deteriorates its electrical and mechanical properties. Main oxidation mitigation approaches involve alloying or surface passivation technologies using organic molecules or inorganic&#8208;based materials. However, surface alloying often modifies the physical properties of copper, while surface passivation is characterized with limited thermal and chemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical approach for surface&#8208;anchoring of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nanolayer on copper electrodes. NHC&#8208;nanolayer was prepared by electro&#8208;deposition of alkyne&#8208;functionalized imidazolium cations. Water reduction reaction generated high concentration of hydroxide ions in proximity to the copper electrode. The hydroxide ions deprotonated the alkyne&#8208;functionalized imidazolium cations, inducing the self&#8208;assembly of NHCs on the electrode&#8217;s surface. In addition, hydroxide ions deprotonated the alkyne group and enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization reaction by coupling surface&#8208;anchored and solvated NHCs that resulted the formation of 2 nm thick NHC&#8208;nanolayer. Copper film coated with NHC&#8208;nanolayer demonstrated high oxidation resistance at elevated temperature and in alkaline conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlative Electrochemical Microscopy for the Elucidation of the Local Ionic and Electronic Properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the SEI prevents the continuous degradation of the electrolyte at the anode. The SEI acts as an insu&#173;lating layer for electron transfer, still allowing the ionic flux through the layer. We combine the feedback and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current modes of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the first time to assess quantitatively the local electronic and ionic properties of the SEI varying the SEI formation conditions and the used electrolytes in the field of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Correlations between the electronic and ionic properties of the resulting SEI on a model Cu electrode demonstrates the unique feasibility of the proposed strategy to provide the two essential properties of an SEI: ionic and electronic conductivity in dependence on the formation conditions, which is anticipated to exhibit a significant impact on the field of LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cold Denaturation of Proteins in the Absence of Solvent: Implications for Protein Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of temperature on the stability of proteins is well explored above 298K, but harder to track experimentally below 273K. Variable temperature ion mobility mass spectrometry (VT IM&#8208;MS) allows us to measure the structure of molecules at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. Here we monitor conformational changes that occur to two isotypes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on cooling by measuring their collision cross sections (CCS) at discrete drift gas temperatures from 295 to 160K. The CCS at 250K is larger than predicted from collisional theory and experimental data at 295K. This restructure is attributed to change in the strength of stabilizing intermolecular interactions. Below 250K the CCS of the mAbs increases in line with prediction implying no rearrangement. Comparing data from isotypes suggest disulfide bridging influences thermal structural rearrangement. These findings indicate that  in vacuo  deep&#8208;freezing minimizes denaturation and maintains the native fold and VT IM&#8208;MS measurements at sub ambient temperatures provide new insights to the phenomenon of cold denaturation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds.&#160; Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the g position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;C  carbenium  interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pd&#8211;H/Isothiourea Cooperative Catalysis Approach to anti&#8208;Aldol Motifs:&#160;Enantioselective a&#8208;Alkylation of Prochiral Esters with Oxyallenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160; biological and therapeutic significance of natural products is a powerful impetus for the development of efficient methods to facilitate their construction. Accordingly, and reflecting the prevalence of beta&#8208;oxy&#8208;carbonyl motifs,, a sophisticated arsenal of aldol&#8208;based strategies has evolved that is contingent on the generation of single enolate isomers. Since this has the potential to compromise efficiency in reagent&#8208;based paradigms, direct catalysis&#8208;based solutions would be enabling. To complement the array of substrate&#8208;based strategies, and regulate enolate geometry at the catalyst level, a direct catalytic alkylation of esters with oxyallenes has been developed. Synergizing metal hydride reactivity with Lewis base catalysis has resulted in a broad reaction scope with useful levels of stereocontrol (up to &gt;99%  ee  ). Facile derivatization of these ambiphilic linchpins is demonstrated, providing access to high&#8208;value  vicinal  stereocenter&#8208;containing motifs, including 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes have led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing for the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA&#8217;s inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomeric Acceptor: A &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy to Bridge Small Molecules and Polymers for Stable Solar Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomeric acceptors are expected to combine the advantages of both highly developed small molecular and polymeric acceptors. However, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on oligomers lag far behind due to their slow development and low diversity. Here, three oligomeric acceptors were produced through oligomerization of small molecules. The dimer dBTIC&#947;&#8208;EH achieved the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.48% in bulk heterojunction devices and possess T80 (80% of the initial PCE) lifetime of&#160;1020 h under illumination, which are far better than that of small molecular and polymeric acceptors. More excitingly, it showed PCEs of 16.06% in quasi&#8208;planar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) devices which is the highest value OSCs using oligomeric acceptors to date. These results suggest that oligomerization of small molecules is a promising strategy to achieve OSCs with optimized performance between the high efficiency and durable stability, and give oligomeric materials a shining future in the commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Extraction of Transition Metals from Spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 Cathode via Regulation of Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complexity of chemical compounds in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) results in great difficulties in the extraction of multiple transition metals, which have similar physicochemical characteristics. Here, we propose a novel strategy for selective extraction of nickel, cobalt, and manganese from spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 with high recovery yields of 99.1%, 95.1%, and 95.3%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well&#8208;designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the sustainable development of the battery recycling industry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nonenzymatic Analog of Pyrimidine Nucleobase Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic theories for the origin of life posit that inorganic catalysts enabled self&#8208;organized chemical precursors to the pathways of metabolism, including those that make genetic molecules. Recently, experiments showing nonenzymatic versions of a number of core metabolic pathways have started to support this idea. However, experimental demonstrations of nonenzymatic reaction sequences along the  de novo  ribonucleotide biosynthesis pathways are limited. Here we show that all three reactions of pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis that convert aspartate to orotate proceed at 60 &#186;C without photochemistry under aqueous conditions in the presence of metals such as Cu  2+  and Mn  4+  . Combining reactions into one&#8208;pot variants is also possible. Life may not have invented pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis from scratch, but simply refined existing nonenzymatic reaction channels. This work is a first step towards uniting metabolic theories of life&#8217;s origin with those centered around genetic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymers with Fluorine Induced Favorable Molecular Stacking Enable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) are explored by inserting a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated fluoro&#8208;substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene polymeric chains. The broad conjugated plane of pyrene and &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; selenium atoms not only enhance the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of HTM molecules greatly but also render a strong interaction with perovskite surface, leading to an efficient charge transport/transfer in both HTM layer and perovskite/HTM interface. Note that fluorine substitution adjacent to pyrene boosts the stacking of HTMs towards a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation, further facilitating the efficient charge transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing  PE10  as dopant&#8208;free HTM afford an excellent efficiency of 22.3% and dramatically enhanced the device longevity, qualifying it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Disulfide Exchange Polymerization of Polyguanidine for Effective Biomedical Applications by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New preparation methods of vectors are the key to developing next generation of biomacromolecule delivery systems. In this study, a controllable disulfide exchange polymerization was established to obtain low&#8208;toxicity and efficient bioreducible polyguanidines (mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSSn, n = 13, 26, 39, 75, 105) by regulating the concentration of activated nucleophiles and reaction time under mild reaction conditions. The relationship between the degrees of polymerization and biocompatibility was studied to identify the optimal polyguanidine mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26. Such polyguanidine exhibited good in virto performance in delivering different functional nucleic acids. The impressive therapeutic effects of mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26 were further verified in the 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice as well as the mice with full&#8208;thickness skin defects. Controllable disulfide exchange polymerization provides an attractive strategy for the construction of new biomacromolecule delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of new bioorthogonal reactions with mutual orthogonality to classic bioorthogonal reactions such as the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click reaction and the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is of great importance in providing chemical tools for multiplex labelling of live cells. Here we report the first anionic cycloaddend&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal cycloaddition reaction between phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione and furan&#8208;2( 3H  )&#8208;one derivatives, where the high polarity of water is exploited to stabilize the highly electron&#8208;rich anionic cycloaddend. The reaction is metal&#8208; and strain&#8208;free, which proceeds rapidly in aqueous solution and on live cells with a second&#8208;order rate constants up to 119 M &#8208;1  s &#8208;1  . The combined utilization of this reaction together with the two other widely used bioorthogonal reactions allows for mutually orthogonal labelling of three types of proteins or three groups of living cells in one batch without cross&#8208;talking. Such results highlight the great potential for multiplex labelling of different biomolecules in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanines:&#160;Amphiphilic Phosphotyrosine Mimetics Displaying Fluorine&#8208;Specific Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF5&#8208;amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono&#8208;anionic PF5 motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein&#8208;binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8208;F&#8208;bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Free Ring&#8211;Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Hydrazonium Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ring&#8211;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclopropenes using hydrazonium initiators is described. The initiators, which are formed by the condensation of 2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and an aldehyde, polymerize cyclopropene monomers by a sequence of [3+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion reactions. This process generates short chain polyolefins (Mn &#8804; 9.4 kg/mol) with relatively low dispersities (&#272; &#8804; 1.4). The optimized conditions showed efficiency comparable to that achieved with Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyst for the polymerization of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclopropene. A positive correlation between monomer to initiator ratio and degree of polymerization was revealed through NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Lactonization of Alkynylmalonic Acids Enabled by Chiral Bifunctional P,N ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the linear coordination nature of gold(I) catalysts, achieving high enantiocontrol in asymmetric gold catalysis is a big challenge. To improve the enantiocontrol of gold catalysis, an ion&#8208;pairing strategy was therefore proposed. A series of bifunctional P,N ligands based on chiral spirocyclic and biaryl scaffolds were synthesized and applied in the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric lactonization of alkynylmalonic acids. A wide range of chiral lactones containing an &#945;&#8208;position quaternary stereocenter were synthesized with high yields, excellent regioselectivity and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utilities of the current reaction were demonstrated by gram scale synthesis and transformations of chiral lactones. The origin of enantioselectivity and the role of the alcohol additive were elucidated  via  control experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Class of Readily Tunable Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium(III) Catalyst for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral half&#8208;sandwich cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) (CpRh  III  ) complexes are powerful catalysts to promote asymmetric C&#8208;H activation reactions. Their preparation normally involved linking or embedding the Cp motif to or into a certain chiral backbone to forge the so&#8208;called chiral Cp ligand. However, preparation of planar&#8208;chiral CpRh  III  catalyst bearing a non&#8208;chiral Cp ligand remains a formidable challenge and rarely reported. We describe herein an unusual class of planar&#8208;chiral rhodium catalysts bearing non&#8208;chiral Cp ligands. Differed from existing ones, this catalyst is facile to tune. Twelve chiral CpRh  III  catalysts had been prepared with ease, and successfully used into two enantioselective C&#8208;H activation reactions. Given its convenient synthesis and high structural tunability, this catalyst is expected to find more utilities in asymmetric C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving 37.1% Green Electroluminescent Efficiency and 0.09 eV Full Width at Half Maximum Based on a Ternary Boron&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Nitrogen Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a ternary boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;nitrogen embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with multiple resonance thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), namely DBNO, is developed by adopting the  para  boron&#8208;&#960;&#8208;boron and  para  oxygen&#8208;&#960;&#8208;oxygen strategy. The designed molecule presents a vivid green emission with high photoluminescence quantum yield (96%) and extremely narrow    full width at half maximum  (FWHM) of 19 nm/0.09 eV, which surpasses all previously reported green TADF emitters to date. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction endows it with a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio of 96%. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on DBNO reveals a narrowband green emission with a peak at 504 nm and a FWHM of 24 nm/0.12 eV. Particularly, a significantly improved device performance is achieved by the TADF&#8208;sensitization (  hyperfluorescence  ) mechanism, presenting a FWHM of 27 nm and maximum external quantum efficiency of 37.1%.</dc:description>

In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction endows it with a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio of 96%. The organic light-emitting diode (OLED) based on DBNO reveals a narrowband green emission with a peak at 504 nm and a FWHM of 24 nm/0.12 eV. Particularly, a significantly improved device performance is achieved by the TADF-sensitization (  hyperfluorescence  ) mechanism, presenting a FWHM of 27 nm and maximum external quantum efficiency of 37.1%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting the Productivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Enhancing CO2 Diffusion through Porous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and feedstocks offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. However, the commercialization is limited by the low productivity. Here, we report a strategy to enhance the productivity of CO2 electroreduction by improving diffusion of CO2 to the surface of catalysts using the porous organic cages (POCs) as an additive. It was noted that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could reach 76.1% with a current density of 1.7 A cm&#8208;2 when Cu&#8208;nanorod(nr)/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used, which were much higher than that using Cu&#8208;nr. Detailed studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic pores of CC3 can adsorb large amount of CO2 for the reaction, and the diffusion of CO2 in the CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than that in the liquid electrolyte. Thus, more CO2 molecules contact with the nanocatalysts in the presence of CC3, enhancing CO2 reduction and inhibting generation of H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Synthesis Methodology&#8208;Directed Immiscible Octahedral PdxRh1&#8208;x Dual&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Superior Three&#8208;Way Catalytic Activities over Rh</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study provided an effective strategy to construct dual&#8208;atom sites by solid&#8208;solution alloying. A slow synthesis methodology was established for the solid solution preparations as dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts. The atomic&#8208;level homogeneous Pd  x  Rh  1&#8722;x  dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts were successfully synthesized over the whole composition range, as convinced by the X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscope&#8208;energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy mapping measurements. The challenging morphology formation in immiscible alloys was achieved by an energy controlling process as the octahedral Rh&#8208;rich alloys. The Pd  0.3  Rh  0.7  dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst had unique surface states to activate the key reactants of CO and NO in the complex three&#8208;way catalytic reactions, and it performed significantly better than pure Rh.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools for Protein Lysine Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine acylation plays pivotal roles in cell physiology, including DNA transcription and repair, signal transduction, immune defense, metabolism, and many other key cellular processes. Molecular mechanisms of dysregulated lysine acylation are closely involved in the pathophysiological progress of many human diseases, most notably cancers. In recent years, chemical biology tools have become instrumental in studying the function of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), identifying new &#8216;writers&#8217;, &#8216;erasers&#8217; and &#8216;readers&#8217;, and in targeted therapies. Here, we describe key developments in chemical biology approaches that have advanced the study of lysine acylation and its regulatory proteins (2016&#8208;2021). We further discuss the discovery of ligands (inhibitors and PROTACs) that are capable of targeting regulators of lysine acylation. Next, we discuss some current challenges of these chemical biology probes and suggest how chemists and biologists can utilize chemical probes with more discriminating capacity. Finally, we suggest some critical considerations in future studies of PTMs from our perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Desymmetrization of&#160;1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines by C(sp3)&#8211;H&#160;Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is the enantioselective synthesis of Hantzsch&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs), which are frequently contained in pharmaceuticals. Readily available symmetrical 1,4&#8208;DHPs were used as substrates, and the methyl group at the 2&#8208; or 6&#8208;position of the 1,4&#8208;DHP was selectively monobrominated by desymmetrizing enantioselective bromination. The inert C&#8211;H bond was converted into a versatile C&#8211;Br bond, which guaranteed the modification of the chiral 1,4&#8208;DHP derivatives with high efficiency. Furthermore, axially chiral 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were accessible by central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Hetero)arylsulfur compounds where the S atom is in the oxidation state (VI) represent a large percentage of the molecular functionalities present in organic chemistry. More specifically, (hetero)aryl&#8210;S(VI) fluorides have recently received enormous attention due to their potential as chemical biology probes, as a result of their reactivity in a simple, modular and ef&#64257;cient manner. Whereas the synthesis and application of the level 1 of fluorination at S(VI) (sulfonyl and sulfonimidoyl fluorides) have been widely studied and reviewed, the synthetic strategies towards higher levels of fluorination (level 2 to 5) are somewhat more limited.
