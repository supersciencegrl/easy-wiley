      <title>Endowing zeolite LTA superballs with multifold light manipulation ability</title>
      <dc:description>Advances in zeolites research emerging from interdisciplinary efforts have opened new opportunities beyond conventional applications. Colloids drive much current research owing to their distinct collective behaviors  , but so far, zeolite used as a colloidal building block to construct ordered superstructures remains unexplored.

Remarkably, self&#8208;assembly of ZAS at elevated temperature forms 3D chiral photonic crystals that enable negative circular dichroism, selective reflection of right&#8208;handed circularly polarized (CP) light and left&#8208;handed CP luminescence based on PBG.

      <title>Boosting Quantum Efficiency of Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence up to 52% via Intramolecular Halogen Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications in optoelectronics, bioelectronics, and security protection. However, achieving UOP with high quantum efficiency (QE) over 20% is still full of challenges due to the forbidden intersystem crossing (ISC) and fast non&#8208;radiative transitions in organic molecules. Here, we present a novel strategy to enhance the QE of UOP materials by modulating intramolecular halogen bonding via structural isomerism. The QE of CzS2Br reaches up to 52.10%, which is the highest afterglow efficiency reported so far. The crucial reason for the extraordinary QE is intramolecular halogen bonding, which can not only effectively enhance ISC by promoting spin&#8208;orbit coupling, but also greatly confine excited&#8208;molecular motions to restrict non&#8208;radiative pathways. This work provides a reasonable strategy to develop highly efficient UOP materials for practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Solvation Rule for Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Enabler in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the exceptionally high energy density of lithium metal anodes, the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is still impeded by the instability of the interphase between the lithium metal and the electrolyte. To formulate a functional electrolyte system that can stabilize the lithium metal anode, one must understand the solvation behavior of the solvent molecules since the electrochemical properties of a solvent can be heavily influenced by its solvation status. We unambiguously demonstrated the solvation rule for the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) enabler in an electrolyte system. In this study, fluoroethylene carbonate was used as the SEI enabler due to its ability to form a robust SEI on the lithium metal surface, allowing relatively stable LMB cycling. The results revealed that the solvation number of fluoroethylene carbonate must be &#8805; 1 to ensure the formation of a stable SEI in which the sacrificial reduction of the SEI enabler subsequently leads to the stable cycling of LMBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrophobic organic electrolyte protected Zn anodes for aqueous Zn batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage device due to low cost and high energy density.

Here, we separate aqueous electrolyte from Zn anode by coating a thin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer on anode and filling the pores of MOF with hydrophobic Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP) organic electrolyte that is immiscible with aqueous Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;H2O bulk electrolyte.

      <title>Detailed Visualization of Aromaticity Using Isotropic Magnetic Shielding</title>
      <dc:description>For many years, Clar&#8217;s aromatic sextet theory has served as a qualitative method for assessing the aromatic character of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A new approach, based on the calculation of isotropic magnetic shielding (IMS) contour plots, is shown to provide a feature&#8208;rich picture of aromaticity that is both quantitative yet still easily interpreted. Chemists are visual creatures who are adept at discerning reactivity and chemical behavior from molecular structures. To quote Roald Hoffman, &#8220;People like pictures. Chemists live off them.&#8221; Thus, the detailed image analysis we present simultaneously provides quantitative assessment of electronic structure, which is still easy&#8208;to&#8208;understand through visual inspection, embedded in an aesthetically appealing and intuitive picture that draws the reader in. In this study, we provide novel computed contour plots for a representative selection of aromatic molecules. Where Clar&#8217;s static drawings capture only a partial sketch of the electronic properties of a molecule, IMS contour plots present a detailed, global landscape of a molecule that sums all possible resonance structures. This novel analysis allows us to correct certain drawbacks of Clar&#8217;s analysis with respect to polycyclic aromatics and quantitatively assess the bonding and electronic structure of acene hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Advances of Synthetic Macrocycle&#8208;Based Nonporous Adaptive Crystals for Molecular Separation</title>
      <dc:description>The exploitation of new materials for adsorptive separation of industrially important hydrocarbons is of great importance in both scientific research and petrochemical industry. Nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) as a robust class of synthetic materials have drawn much attention during the past five years for their superior performance in adsorption and separation. Pillararenes are the main family of macrocyclic arenes used for NACs construction, where the structure&#8211;function relationship has been intensively studied. In the past two years, some emerging types of synthetic macrocyclic arenes have been successfully brought into this research field, showing the gradual enrichment and diversification of NACs materials. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the recent advances of synthetic macrocycle&#8208;based NACs, which are categorized by various practical applications in molecular separation. Besides, NACs&#8208;based vapochromic supramolecular systems are also discussed. Finally, future perspectives and challenges of NACs are given. We envisage that this mini&#8208;review will be a useful and timely reference for those who are interested in new molecular and supramolecular crystals for storage and separation applications.</dc:description>

      <title>&#173;Recoding Cancer Epigenome by Intervening Metabolism and Iron Homeostasis with Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Re(I) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The development and malignancy of cancer cells are closely related to the changes of epigenome. In this work, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted rhenium(I) complex (  DFX&#8208;Re3  ) integrating the clinical iron chelating agent deferasirox (  DFX  ) has been designed. By relocating iron to mitochondria and changing the key metabolic species related to epigenetic modifications,  DFX&#8208;Re3  can elevate the methylation levels of histone, DNA and RNA. As a consequence,  DFX&#8208;Re3  affects the events related to apoptosis, RNA polymerases and T&#8208;cell receptor signalling pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that  DFX&#8208;Re3  induces immunogenic apoptotic cell death and exhibits potent antitumor activity  in vivo  . Our study provides a new approach for the design of novel epigenetic drugs that can recode cancer epigenome by intervening mitochondrial metabolism and iron homeostasis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;fluorination reactions of carbonyl compounds are among the most powerful and efficient synthetic methods for constructing optically active &#945;&#8208;fluorinated carbonyl compounds. &#160; Nevertheless, &#945;&#8208;fluorination of &#945;&#8208;nonbranched carboxylic acid derivatives is still a big challenge because of relatively high p  K  a  values of their &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms and difficulty of subsequent synthetic transformation without epimerization. &#160; Here we show that chiral Cu(II)&#8211;3&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208; L &#8208;alanine&#8208;derived amide complexes are highly effective catalysts for the enantio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;fluorination of  N  &#8208;( &#945;&#8208;arylacetyl)&#8208; and  N  &#8208;( &#945;&#8208;alkylacetyl)&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazoles. &#160; The substrate scope has been widely broadened (25 examples including quaternary &#945;&#8208;fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative). &#160; &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated products are converted to the corresponding esters, secondary amides, tertiary amides, ketones, and alcohols with almost no epimerization in quantitative yield.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Catalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;fluorination reactions of carbonyl compounds are among the most powerful and efficient synthetic methods for constructing optically active &#945;&#8208;fluorinated carbonyl compounds. &#160; Nevertheless, &#945;&#8208;fluorination of &#945;&#8208;nonbranched carboxylic acid derivatives is still a big challenge because of relatively high p  K  a  values of their &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms and difficulty of subsequent synthetic transformation without epimerization. &#160; Here we show that chiral Cu(II)&#8211;3&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208; L &#8208;alanine&#8208;derived amide complexes are highly effective catalysts for the enantio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;fluorination of  N  &#8208;( &#945;&#8208;arylacetyl)&#8208; and  N  &#8208;( &#945;&#8208;alkylacetyl)&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazoles. &#160; The substrate scope has been widely broadened (25 examples including quaternary &#945;&#8208;fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative). &#160; &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated products are converted to the corresponding esters, secondary amides, tertiary amides, ketones, and alcohols with almost no epimerization in quantitative yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Correlating Glycoforms of DC&#8208;SIGN with Stability Using a Combination of Enzymatic Digestion and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry
</title>
      <dc:description>
Uncovering stability of DC&#8208;SIGN glycoforms with native mass spectrometry: A combined strategy of exoglycosidase sequencing, native mass spectrometry, ion mobility, and gas&#8208;phase unfolding uncovered the occupancy and structural detail of O&#8208;glycans present on the carbohydrate binding domain of DC&#8208;SIGN. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding by ion mobility revealed differences in stability among glycoforms, independent of glycoprotein mass.







Abstract
The immune scavenger protein DC&#8208;SIGN interacts with glycosylated proteins and has a putative role in facilitating viral infection. How these recognition events take place with different viruses is not clear and the effects of glycosylation on the folding and stability of DC&#8208;SIGN have not been reported. Herein, we report the development and application of a mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based approach to both uncover and characterise the effects of O&#8208;glycans on the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN. We first quantify the Core&#8197;1 and 2 O&#8208;glycan structures on the carbohydrate recognition and extracellular domains of the protein using sequential exoglycosidase sequencing. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry, we show how specific O&#8208;glycans, and/or single monosaccharide substitutions, alter both the overall collision cross section and the gas&#8208;phase stability of the DC&#8208;SIGN isoforms. We find that rather than the mass or length of glycoprotein modifications, the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN is better correlated with the number of glycosylation sites.

      <title>Activatable CRISPR Transcriptional Circuits Lighted up by Fluorescent RNA for mRNA Sensing and Silencing</title>
      <dc:description>CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 systems precisely activated with cell&#8208;specific information improve abilities to develop smart sensors or therapeutic strategies. We report the first development of an activatable dCas9 transcriptional circuit that enables sensing and silencing of mRNA in living cells using hybridization&#8208;mediated structure switching for gRNA activation. The gRNA is designed with the spacer sequence blocked by a hairpin structure, and mRNA hybridization induces gRNA structure switching and activates transcription of reporter RNA. A mRNA sensor developed using light&#8208;up RNA reporter shows high sensitivity and fast&#8208;response imaging of  survivin  mRNA in cells under drug treatments and different cell lines. Furthermore, a feedback circuit is engineered by incorporating a small hairpin RNA in reporter RNA. It demonstrates a smart strategy for dynamic sensing and silencing of  survivin  with induced tumor cell apoptosis. This circuit illustrates a broadly applicable platform to develop cell&#8208;specific sensing and therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

      <title>Atropisomerism in diarylamines: structural requirements and mechanisms of conformational interconversion</title>
      <dc:description>In common with other hindered structures containing two aromatic rings linked by a short tether, diarylamines may exhibit atropisomerism (chirality due to restricted rotation). Previous examples have principally been tertiary amines, especially those with cyclic scaffolds. Little is known of the structural requirement for atropisomerism in structurally simpler secondary and acyclic diarylamines. In this paper we describe a systematic study of a series of acyclic secondary diarylamines, and we quantify the degree of steric hindrance in the&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;ortho&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;positions that is required for atropisomerism to result. Through a detailed experimental and computational analysis, the role of each&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;ortho&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&#8208;substituent on the mechanism and rate of conformational interconversion is rationalised. We also present a simple predictive model for the design of configurationally stable secondary diarylamines.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Proton&#8208;responsive photochromic molecules are attractive for their ability to react on non&#8208;invasive rapid optical stimuli and the importance of protonation/deprotonation process in various fields. Conventionally, their acidic/basic sites are on hetero&#8208;atoms, which are orthogonal to the photo&#8208;active&#160;p&#8208;center. Here, we incorporate azulene, an acid&#8208;sensitive pure hydrocarbon, into the skeleton of a diarylethene&#8208;type photoswitch. The latter exhibits a novel proton&#8208;gated negative photochromic ring&#8208;closure and its optical response upon protonation in both open and closed forms is much more pronounced than those of diarylethene photoswitches with hetero&#8208;atom based acidic/basic moieties. The unique behavior of the new photoswitch can be attributed to direct protonation on its&#160;p&#8208;system, supported by&#160;1H NMR and theoretical calculations.

      <title>Targeted Degradation of Transcription Co&#8208;activator SRC&#8208;1 through the N&#8208;Degron Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Aberrantly elevated steroid receptor co&#8208;activator&#8208;1 (SRC&#8208;1) expression and activity are strongly correlated with cancer progression and metastasis. Here we report, for the first time, the development of a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that is composed of a selective SRC&#8208;1 binder linked to a specific ligand for UBR box, a unique class of E3 ligases recognizing N&#8208;degrons. We showed that the bifunctional molecule efficiently and selectively induced the degradation of SRC&#8208;1 in cells through the N&#8208;degron pathway. Importantly, given the ubiquitous expression of the UBR protein in most cells, PROTACs targeting the UBR box could degrade a protein of interest regardless of cell types. We also showed that the SRC&#8208;1 degrader significantly suppressed cancer cell invasion and migration  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Together, these results demonstrate that the SRC&#8208;1 degrader can be an invaluable chemical tool in the studies of SRC&#8208;1 functions. Moreover, our findings suggest PROTACs based on the N&#8208;degron pathway as a widely useful strategy to degrade disease&#8208;relevant proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable Ti3+ defects in oriented mesoporous titania frameworks for efficient photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Black TiO  2  has attracted great scientific attention owing to its outstanding photoelectronic properties.

Such integration of unique mesoscopic architecture and atomic vacancies provide both effective mass transportation and enhanced light utilization, leading to a remarkable increase in H  2  generation rate. A maximum H  2  evolution rate of 19.8 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  can be achieved, along with outstanding stability under solar light, which is superior to the previous TiO  2  &#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosted Tc of 166 K in superconducting D3S synthesized from elemental sulfur and hydrogen</title>
      <dc:description>The discovery of superconductivity in H3S at 203 K marked an advance towards room&#8208;temperature superconductivity and demonstrated the enormous potential of H&#8208;dominated compounds to possess high critical temperatures (Tcs). There have been numerous reports of the H&#8208;S system over the last five years; nevertheless, important questions remain unanswered. In particular, it is crucial to verify whether the Tc was determined correctly for samples prepared from compressed H2S, since they are inevitably contaminated with H&#8208;depleted byproducts. In the present study, we prepare stoichiometric H3S by direct in situ synthesis from elemental S and excess H2. We reveal that the Im&#8208;3m phase of D3S samples exhibits Tcs that are significantly higher than previously reported values (~150 K), reaching a maximum Tc of 166 K at 157 GPa. Furthermore, we confirm that the sharp decrease in Tc below 150 GPa is accompanied by continuous rhombohedral structural distortions and demonstrate that the Cccm phase is non&#8208;metallic, with molecular H2 units in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The discovery of superconductivity in H3S at 203 K marked an advance towards room&#8208;temperature superconductivity and demonstrated the enormous potential of H&#8208;dominated compounds to possess high critical temperatures (Tcs). There have been numerous reports of the H&#8208;S system over the last five years; nevertheless, important questions remain unanswered. In particular, it is crucial to verify whether the Tc was determined correctly for samples prepared from compressed H2S, since they are inevitably contaminated with H&#8208;depleted byproducts. In the present study, we prepare stoichiometric H3S by direct in situ synthesis from elemental S and excess H2.

      <title>Stretchable Electrochemical Sensors for Cell and Tissue Detection</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical sensing based on conventional rigid electrodes has large restriction on characterizing the biomolecules of deformed cells or soft tissues. The recent emergence of stretchable sensors allows them to conformally contact to curved surface and perfectly comply with the deformation of living cells and tissues. This provides a powerful strategy to monitor biomolecules from mechanically deformed cells, tissues and organisms in real time, and opens up new opportunities to explore the mechanotransduction process. In this minireview, we first summarize the fabrication of stretchable electrodes with emphasis on the nanomaterial&#8208;enabled strategies. We then describe representative applications of stretchable sensor in real&#8208;time monitoring of mechanically&#8208;sensitive cells and tissues. Finally, we present the future possibilities and challenges of stretchable electrochemical sensing in cell, tissue and in vivo detection.</dc:description>

      <title>Planting repulsion centers for faster ionic diffusion in superionic conductors</title>
      <dc:description>The successful launch of solid&#8208;state batteries relies on the discovery of solid electrolytes with remarkably high ionic conductivity.

Herein, we propose a new design strategy to facilitate ionic conduction in SICs by planting immobile repulsion centers. Our  ab&#8208;initio  molecular dynamics simulations on the model system Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  demonstrate that the sodium ionic conductivity can be increased by approximately one order of magnitude by simply doping large Cs ions as repulsion centers in the characteristic vacant site of Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  . We find that planting immobile repulsion centers locally induces the formation of high&#8208;energy sites, leading to a &#8220;fast track&#8221; for ionic conduction owing to the unique interactions among mobile ions in SICs.

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopropanone Equivalents and Application to the Formation of Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclopropanone derivatives have long been considered unsustainable synthetic intermediates due to their extreme strain and kinetic instability. Herein, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;sulfonylcyclopropanols as stable yet powerful equivalents of the corresponding cyclopropanone derivatives, via &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of sulfonylcyclopropanes using a bis(silyl) peroxide as electrophilic oxygen source.

Both the electronic and steric nature of the sulfonyl moiety, which serves as a base&#8208;labile protecting group and confers crystallinity to these cyclopropanone precursors, were found to have a crucial impact on the rate of equilibration to the corresponding cyclopropanone, highlighting their modular nature and the potential for their widespread adoption as synthetic intermediates. The utility of these cyclopropanone surrogates is demonstrated in a mild and stereospecific formal [3+1] cycloaddition with simple hydroxylamines acting here as nitrene equivalents, leading to the efficient formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactam derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Anisotropic electron conductance driven by reaction byproducts on a porous network of dibromobenzothiadiazole on Cu(110)</title>
      <dc:description>Efficiency in charge&#8208;transport is a fundamental but demanding prerequisite to allow better exploitation of molecular functionalities in organic electronics and energy&#8208;conversion systems. Here, we report on a mechanism that enables a one&#8208;dimensional conductance structure by connecting discrete molecular states at 2.1eV through the pores of a metal&#8208;organic network on Cu(110). Two adjacent, periodic and isoenergetic contributions, namely a molecular resonance and the confined surface&#8208;state, add&#8208;up leading to anisotropic structures, as channels, observable in real&#8208;space conductance images. The adsorption configurations of Br atoms, inorganic byproduct of the redox&#8208;reacted 4,7&#8208;dibromobenzo[c]&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (2Br&#8208;BTD) molecules on the copper surface, drive the confinement of the Cu surface state within the pores and critically control the channel continuity. Small displacements of the Br atoms change the local surface potential misaligning the energy levels. This work visualizes the effect of order&#8208;disorder transitions caused by the movement of single atoms in the electronic properties of two&#8208;dimensional organic networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Styrylethyltrimethoxysilane &#8211; Coated Surfaces, Particles and Crosslinked Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfur as a side product of natural gas and oil refining is

an underused resource. Converting landfilled sulfur waste into

materials merges the ecological imperative of resource efficiency

with economic considerations. A strategy to convert sulfur into

polymeric materials is the inverse vulcanization reaction of sulfur

with alkenes. However, the formed materials are of limited

applicability, since they need to be cured at high temperatures

(&gt; 130 &#176;C) for multiple hours. Herein, the reaction of elemental sulfur

with styrylethyltrimethoxysilane is reported. Marrying the inverse

vulcanization and silane chemistry yielded high sulfur content

polysilanes, which could be cured via room temperature

polycondensation to obtain coated surfaces, particles, and

crosslinked materials. The polycondensation was triggered by

hydrolysis of poly(sulfur&#8208;r&#8208;styrylethyltrimethoxysilane) (poly(Sn&#8208;r&#8208;

StyTMS) under mild conditions (HCl, pH 4). For the first time, an

inverse vulcanization polymer could be conveniently coated and

mildly cured via post&#8208;polycondensation. Silica microparticles coated

with the high sulfur content polymer could improve their Hg2+ ion

remediation capability.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on CuOx Nanocubes Tracking the Evolution of Chemical State, Geometric Structure, and Catalytic Selectivity using Operando Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The direct electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into multi&#8208;carbon (C  2+  ) products still faces fundamental and technological challenges. While facet&#8208;controlled and oxide&#8208;derived Cu materials have been touted as promising catalysts, their stability has remained problematic and poorly understood. The present work uncovers changes in the chemical and morphological state of supported and unsupported Cu  2  O nanocubes during operation in low&#8208;current H&#8208;Cells and in high&#8208;current Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) using neutral pH buffer conditions. While unsupported nanocubes achieved a sustained C  2+  faradaic efficiency of around 60% for 40 h, the dispersion on a carbon support sharply shifted the selectivity pattern towards C  1  products. O  perando  XAS and time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy revealed the degradation of the cubic shape and, in the presence of a carbon support, the formation of small Cu&#8208;seeds during the surprisingly slow reduction of bulk Cu  2  O. Here, the initially (100)&#8208;rich facet structure has presumably no controlling role on the catalytic selectivity, whereas the oxide&#8208;derived generation of under&#8208;coordinated lattice defects, as revealed by the  operando  Cu&#8208;Cu coordination numbers, can support the high C  2+  product yields.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Electrofreezing of Super Cooled Water on Surfaces of Pyroelectric Crystals is Trigered by Planar&#8208;Trigonal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>Electrofreezing experiments of super&#8208;cooled water (SCW) with different ions, performed directly on the charged hemihedral faces of pyroelectric LiTaO  3  and AgI crystals, in the presence and in the absence of pyroelectric charge are reported. It is demonstrated that bicarbonate (HCO  3   &#8315;   ) ions elevate the icing temperature near the positively charged faces. In contrast, the hydronium (H  3  O   &#8314;   ), slightly reduces the icing temperature. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the hydrated planar&#8208;trigonal HCO  3   &#8315; ions   self&#8208;assemble with water molecules near the surface of the AgI crystal as clusters of slightly different configuration from those of the ice&#8208;like hexagons. These clusters, however, have a tendency to serve as embryonic nuclei for ice crystallization. Consequently, we predicted and experimentally confirmed that the planar trigonal ions of NO  3   &#8315;   and guanidinium (Gdm   &#8314;   ) elevate the icing temperature near the positive and negative charged surfaces, respectively. On the other hand, the Cl   &#8315;   and SO  4  2   &#8315;   ions of different configurations   reduce the icing temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphorothioate Modification of mRNA Accelerates Rate of Translation Initiation Providing More Efficient Protein Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Messenger RNA (mRNA) with phosphorothioate modification (PS&#8208;mRNA) to the phosphate site of A, G, C and U with all possible 16 combinations were prepared, and the translation reaction was evaluated using an  E. coli  cell&#8208;free translation system. Protein synthesis from PS&#8208;mRNA increased in 12 of 15 patterns when compared with that of unmodified mRNA. The protein yield increased 22&#8208;fold when the phosphorothioate modification at A/C sites was introduced into the region from the 5'&#8208;end to the initiation codon. Single&#8208;turnover analysis of PS&#8208;mRNA translation showed that phosphorothioate modification increases the amount of translating ribosomes, suggesting that the rate of translation initiation (rate of ribosome complex formation) was positively affected by the modification.

      <title>Pressure&#8208;Suppressed Carrier Trapping Leads to Enhanced Emission in Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite (HA)2(GA)Pb2I7</title>
      <dc:description>Lattice compression through hydrostatic pressure is an effective way to tune the structural and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites &#8208; a new class of emerging materials for photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting applications. However, few examples exhibit improved photoluminescence (PL) performance of 2D perovskites upon compression. It also remains unclear how the pressure&#8208;induced structural changes affect carrier trapping, which is critical for the optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites. Here, we show a remarkable PL enhancement by 12 folds using pressure to modulate the structure of a recently developed 2D perovskite (HA)2(GA)Pb2I7  (HA =  n&#8208;hexylammonium, GA = guanidinium). This structure features an extremely large cage previously unattainable, affording us a rare opportunity to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship and explore emergent phenomena in halide perovskites.  In situ  structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical analyses reveal that lattice compression under a mild pressure within 1.6 GPa considerably suppresses the carrier trapping, leading to significantly enhanced emission. Further pressurization induces a non&#8208;luminescent amorphous yellow phase, which, surprisingly, is retained and exhibits a continuously increasing bandgap during decompression. When the pressure is released to 1.5 GPa, intriguingly, emission can be triggered by above&#8208;bandgap laser irradiation, accompanied by a color change from yellow to orange. The obtained orange phase could be retained at ambient conditions and exhibits two&#8208;fold higher PL emission compared with the pristine (HA)2(GA)Pb2I7. Our findings not only reveal extraordinary pressure&#8208;induced variations and their underlying mechanisms in 2D halide perovskites but also demonstrate the formation of a new phase with enhanced properties at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Electrofreezing as Triggered by CO2 on Pyroelectric Crystals. A Qualitative Difference of Icing on Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>By performing icing experiments on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces of pyroelectric amino acids and on the x&#8208;cut faces of LiTaO  3  , we discovered that the effect of electrofreezing of super cooled water is triggered by ions of carbonic acid.

(ii) &#160;In the absence of the ionic current, achieved by linking the two hemihedral faces of hydrophilic crystals by a conductive paint, water of the two pH levels freeze at the same temperature.

      <title>Engineering Platinum&#8208;Oxygen Dual Catalytic Sites via Charge Transfer towards High&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;site catalyst allows for a synergetic reaction in the close proximity to enhance catalysis. It is highly desirable to create dual&#8208;site interfaces in single&#8208;atom system in order to maximize the effect. Herein, we report a cation&#8208;deficient electrostatic anchorage route to fabricate an atomically dispersed platinum&#8208;titania catalyst (Pt  1  O1  /Ti  1&#8208;x  O  2  ), which shows greatly enhanced hydrogen evolution activity, surpassing that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in mass by a factor of 53.2.  Operando  techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that Pt  1  O1  /Ti  1&#8208;x  O  2  experiences a Pt&#8208;O dual&#8208;site catalytic pathway, where the inherent charge transfer within the dual sites encourages the jointly coupling protons and plays the key role during the Volmer&#8208;Tafel process. There is almost no decay in the activity of Pt  1  O1  /Ti  1&#8208;x  O  2  over 300,000 cycles, meaning 30 times of enhancement in stability compared to the commercial Pt/C catalysts (10,000 cycles).</dc:description>

A tandem catalytic cycle of [Ir(ppy)  2  (dtb&#8208;bpy)]  +  generates a potent iridium photoreductant via a second catalytic cycle in the presence of DIPEA which productively engages aryl bromides, iodides and even chlorides as well as primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides.

      <dc:description>Here an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of azide&#8208;ynamides via &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbene intermediates is reported, which represents the first generation of &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbenes from alkynes. This protocol enables the practical and divergent synthesis of an array of polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles in generally good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivities. Moreover, such an asymmetric azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization has been achieved with high enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 e.r.) by employing BOX&#8208;Cu complexes as chiral catalysts. Thus, this protocol constitutes the first example of asymmetric azide&#8208;alkyne cyclization.

      <title>High&#8208;Tc Enantiomeric Ferroelectrics Based on Homochiral Dabco&#8208;derivatives (Dabco = 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)</title>
      <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco) and its derivatives have been extensively utilized as building units of excellent molecular ferroelectrics for decades. However, the homochiral dabco&#8208;based ferroelectric remains a blank. Herein, by adding a methyl (Me) group accompanied by the introduction of homochirality to the [H2dabco]2+ in the non&#8208;ferroelectric [H2dabco][TFSA]2 (TFSA = bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)ammonium), we successfully designed enantiomeric ferroelectrics [R and S&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8208;H2dabco][TFSA]2. The two enantiomers show two sequential phase transitions with transition temperature (Tc) as high as 405.8 K and 415.8 K, which is outstanding in both dabco&#8208;based ferroelectrics and homochiral ferroelectrics. To our knowledge, [R and S&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8208;H2dabco][TFSA]2 are the first examples of dabco&#8208;based homochiral ferroelectrics. This finding opens an avenue to construct dabco&#8208;based homochiral ferroelectrics and will inspire the exploration of more eminent enantiomeric molecular ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring Optical Properties of Luminescent Semiconducting Nanocrystals via Hydrostatic, Anisotropic Static, and Dynamic Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>Luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals are a fascinating class of materials because of their size&#8208;dependent emission. Multitudes of past studies have demonstrated that semiconductor nanoparticles with radii smaller than their Bohr radius experience quantum confinement and thus size&#8208;dependent emission. Exerting pressure to these nanoparticles represents an additional, more dynamic, strategy to alter their size and shift their emission. Upon the application of pressure, lattices are strained, and electronic structure is altered. In this review, colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are first introduced. The effects of uniform hydrostatic pressure on the optical properties of metal halide perovskite (ABX  3  ), II&#8208;VI, III&#8208;V, and IV&#8208;VI semiconductor nanocrystals are then examined.

      <title>Natural Soft/Rigid Superlattice as Anodes for High Performance Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The volume expansion and poor conductivity are two major obstacles that hinder the pursuing for the lithium&#8208;ion batteries with long cycling life and high power density. Herein, we highlight a misfit compound PbNbS  3  with soft/rigid superlattice structure, which was unambiguously confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy and electrochemical characterization, as a promising anode material for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries with simultaneously optimized capacity, stability and conductivity. In this model, the soft PbS sublayers primarily react with lithium, endow the capacity and prevent the decompositon of the superlattice structure, while the rigid NbS  2  sublayers support the skeleton and enhances the migration of electrons and lithium ions, as a result synergistically leading to a specific capacity of 710 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 100 mA g  &#8722;1  which is 1.6 times of NbS  2  and 3.9 times of PbS. Our finding reveals the competitive strategy of soft/rigid structure in lithium&#8208;ion battery and broadens the horizons in designing new single&#8208;phase anode materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>E. coli  and  Salmonella  are two of the most common bacterial pathogens involved in food and water borne related deaths. Hence, it is critical to develop rapid and sensitive detection strategies for near outbreak applications. We report a simple and specific assay to detect as low as 1 CFU/mL of  E. coli  in water within 6 hours by targeting the bacteria&#8217;s surface protease activity. The assay relies on polythiophene acetic acid (PTAA) as optical reporter and a short unlabeled peptide (LL37  FRRV  ) previously optimized as substrate for OmpT, an outer membrane protease on  E. coli  . LL37  FRRV  interacts with PTAA to enhance its fluorescence while also inducing the formation of a helical PTAA&#8208;LL37  FRRV  construct, as confirmed by Circular Dichroism. However, in the presence of  E. coli  , LL37  FRRV  is cleaved and can no longer affect PTAA&#8217;s conformation and optical properties.

      <title>Engineering Sensitized Photon Upconversion Efficiency via Nanocrystal Wavefunction and Molecular Geometry</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet energy transfer from inorganic nanocrystals to molecular acceptors has attracted strong attention as a promising approach to high&#8208;efficiency photon upconversion that is important for energy&#8208;related applications. Because energy transfer is a donor&#8208;acceptor interfacial process, it is essential to simultaneously engineer the nanocrystal and molecular parameters in order to uncover unified physical principles that are transferable among different systems. Here we study this problem using CsPbBr  3  and CdSe nanocrystals as triplet donors and carboxylated anthracene isomers as acceptors. We find that the position of the carboxyl anchoring group on the molecule dictates the donor&#8208;acceptor coupling to be either &#8220;through&#8208;bond&#8221; or &#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;, while the relative strengths of the two coupling pathways is controlled by the &#8220;wavefunction&#8208;leakage&#8221; of nanocrystals that can be quantitatively tuned by nanocrystal sizes or shell thicknesses. By simultaneously engineering molecular geometry and nanocrystal wavefunction, energy transfer and photon upconversion efficiencies of a nanocrystal/molecule system can be improved by orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

Because energy transfer is a donor&#8208;acceptor interfacial process, it is essential to simultaneously engineer the nanocrystal and molecular parameters in order to uncover unified physical principles that are transferable among different systems. Here we study this problem using CsPbBr  3  and CdSe nanocrystals as triplet donors and carboxylated anthracene isomers as acceptors. We find that the position of the carboxyl anchoring group on the molecule dictates the donor&#8208;acceptor coupling to be either &#8220;through&#8208;bond&#8221; or &#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;, while the relative strengths of the two coupling pathways is controlled by the &#8220;wavefunction&#8208;leakage&#8221; of nanocrystals that can be quantitatively tuned by nanocrystal sizes or shell thicknesses. By simultaneously engineering molecular geometry and nanocrystal wavefunction, energy transfer and photon upconversion efficiencies of a nanocrystal/molecule system can be improved by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
