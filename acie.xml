         <title>Achieving Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Cascade Cationic Insertion in Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and dissymmetry factor (glum) is difficult due to usually unmatched electric transition dipole moment (&#181;) and magnetic transition dipole moment (m) of materials. Herein we tackle this issue by playing a &#8220;cascade cationic insertion&#8221; trick to achieve strong CPL (with PLQY of ~ 100%) in lead&#8208;free metal halides with high glum values reaching &#8208;2.3&#215;10&#8208;2 without using any chiral inducers. Achiral solvents of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) infiltrate the crystal lattice via asymmetric hydrogen bonding, distorting the perovskite structure to induce the &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; chirality. Surprisingly, additional insertion of Cs+ cation to substitute partial (CH3)2NH2+ transforms the chiral space group to achiral but the crystal maintains chiroptical activity. Further doping of Sb3+ stimulates strong photoluminescence as a result of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) formation without disturbing the crystal framework. The chiral perovskites of indium&#8208;antimony chlorides embedded on LEDs chips demonstrate promising potential as CPL emitters. Our work presents rare cases of chiroptical activity of highly luminescent perovskites from only achiral building blocks via spontaneous resolution as a result of symmetry breaking.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;chiral Nonlinear Optical Effect with Large Anisotropic Response in Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiral organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are vital candidates for superior nonlinear optical (NLO) effects associated with circularly polarized (CP) light. NLO in chiral materials often couples with magnetic dipole (MD) transition, as well as the conventional electric dipole (ED) transition. However, the importance of MD transition in NLO process of chiral OIHPs has not yet been well recognized. Here, the circular polarized probe analysis of second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) provides the direct evidence that the contribution of MD leads to a large anisotropic response to CP lights in chiral OIHPs, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBACl)2PbI4. The thin films exhibit great sensitivity to CP lights over a wide wavelength range, and the g&#8208;value reaches up to 1.57 at the wavelength where the contribution of MD is maximized. Furthermore, it is also effective as CP light generator, outputting CP&#8208;SHG with maximum g&#8208;factor of 1.76 upon the stimulation of linearly polarized light. This study deepens the understanding of relation between chirality and magneto&#8208;optical effect, and such an efficient discrimination and generation of CP light signal is highly applicable for chirality&#8208;based sensor and optical communication devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism in&#160;Carbonic Acid through Direct Synthesis from&#160;Carbon Dioxide Clathrate Hydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is widespread in astrochemically relevant environments, often&#160;coexisting with water (H2O) ices and thus triggering a great interest regarding the
possible formation of their adducts under various thermodynamic conditions. Amongst&#160;them, solid carbonic acid (H2CO3) remains elusive, yet being widely studied. Synthetic
routes followed for its production have always been characterised by drastic irradiation&#160;on solid ice mixtures or complex procedures on fluid samples (such as laser heating at
moderate to high pressures). Here we report about a simpler yet effective synthetic route&#160;to obtain two diverse carbonic acid crystal structures from the fast, cold compression
of pristine CO2 clathrate hydrate samples. The two distinct polymorphs we obtained,&#160;differing in the water content, have been deeply characterised via spectroscopic and
structural techniques to assess their composition and their astonishing pressure stability,&#160;checked up to half a megabar, also highlighting the complex correlations between them
so to compile a detailed phase diagram of this system. These results may have a&#160;profound impact on the prediction and modelisation of the complex chemistry which
characterises many icy bodies of our Solar System.</dc:description>

         <title>Interphase Engineering via Solvent Molecule Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal battery has been regarded as promising next&#8208;generation battery system aiming for higher energy density. However, the lithium metal anode suffers severe side&#8208;reaction and dendrite issues. Its electrochemical performance is significantly depended&#160;on the electrolyte components and solvation structure. Herein, a series of fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect&#160;derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.76%)&#160;enables remarkable CE of 99.71% (25 &#8451;) as well as high CE of 98.56% even at &#8208;20 &#8451;. Moreover, the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery exhibits excellent performance in a wide temperature range&#160;(&#8208;20 to 50&#160;&#8451;) ascribed to the modified interphase rich in LiF/LiO2. Furthermore, the pouch cell delivers superior energy density of 344.4 Wh kg&#8208;1 and maintains 80% capacity retention after 50 cycles. The novel solvent design via molecule chemistry provides alternative strategy to adjust solvation structure and thus favors high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chelating Additive Regulating Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry for Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) usually suffered from poor reversibility and limited lifespan because of serious water induced side&#8208;reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and rampant zinc (Zn) dendrite growth. Reducing the content of water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths can effectively suppress those inherent defects of AZMBs. In this work, we originally discovered that the two carbonyl groups of N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactam (N&#8208;ac) chelating ligand can serve as dual solvation sites to coordinate with Zn2+, thereby minimizing water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths, and greatly inhibit water&#8208;induced side&#8208;reactions and HER. Moreover, the N&#8208;ac chelating additive can form a unique physical barrier interface on Zn surface, preventing the harmful contacting with water. In addition, the preferential adsorption of N&#8208;ac on Zn (002) facets can promote highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn2+ deposition. As a result, Zn//Cu half&#8208;cell within N&#8208;ac added electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;high 99.89% Coulombic efficiency during 8000 cycles. Zn//Zn symmetric cells also demonstrated unprecedented long life of more than 9800 hours (over one year). Aqueous Zn//ZnV6O16&#183;8H2O (Zn//ZVO) full&#8208;cell preserved 78% capacity even after ultra&#8208;long 2000 cycles. A more practical pouch&#8208;cell was also obtained (90.2% capacity after 100 cycles). This method offers a promising strategy for accelerating the development of highly efficient AZMBs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-metal batteries (AZMBs) usually suffered from poor reversibility and limited lifespan because of serious water induced side-reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and rampant zinc (Zn) dendrite growth. Reducing the content of water molecules within Zn-ion solvation sheaths can effectively suppress those inherent defects of AZMBs. In this work, we originally discovered that the two carbonyl groups of N-Acetyl-&#949;-caprolactam (N-ac) chelating ligand can serve as dual solvation sites to coordinate with Zn2+, thereby minimizing water molecules within Zn-ion solvation sheaths, and greatly inhibit water-induced side-reactions and HER. Moreover, the N-ac chelating additive can form a unique physical barrier interface on Zn surface, preventing the harmful contacting with water. In addition, the preferential adsorption of N-ac on Zn (002) facets can promote highly reversible and dendrite-free Zn2+ deposition. As a result, Zn//Cu half-cell within N-ac added electrolyte delivered ultra-high 99.89% Coulombic efficiency during 8000 cycles.

         <title>The Cyanoketenyl Anion [NC3O]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and gram&#8208;scale isolation of the elusive cyanoketenyl anion [NC3O]&#8722; is reported. Despite its cumulene&#8208;like structure, it exhibits a bent geometry in the solid state, which is also confirmed by computational studies. The cyanoketenyl anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules such as CO2, H2O or NH3 to form more complex organic compounds, including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate.







Abstract
Cumulenes and heterocumulenes with three or more cumulative multiple bonds are usually reactive species that serve as valuable building blocks for more complex molecules but tend to isomerize or cyclize and therefore are difficult to isolate. Using a mild ligand exchange reaction at the carbon in &#945;&#8208;metalated ylides, we have now succeeded in the synthesis and gram&#8208;scale isolation of the elusive cyanoketenyl anion [NC3O]&#8722;. Despite its assumed cumulene&#8208;like structure and the delocalization of the negative charge across the whole 5&#8208;atom molecule, it features a bent geometry with a nucleophilic central carbon atom. Computational studies reveal an ambiguous bonding situation in the anion, which can be illustrated only by a combination of different resonance structures. Nonetheless, the anion features remarkable stability, thus allowing the storage of its potassium&#8208;crown ether salt and its application as a highly functional synthetic building block. The cyanoketenyl anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules to form more complex organic compounds, including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate. This work demonstrated that reactive species can be generated by novel synthesis methods and open up atom&#8208;economic pathways to complex compounds from small abundant molecules.

         <title>Correlation between Heteroatom Coordination and Hydrogen Evolution for Single&#8208;site Pt on Carbon&#8208;based Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Pt single&#8208;site catalysts was constructed and exhibited increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along the S&#8208;, P&#8208;, C&#8208; and N&#8208;coordinated Pt. The structure&#8208;performance correlation is established. The multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption deepens the understanding of activity and stability. The density of states (DOS) of Pt 5d orbitals near Fermi level (Ef) can promote the activity by facilitating electron transfer and proton capture.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic performance of single&#8208;site catalysts (SSCs) is closely correlated with the electronic structure of metal atoms. Herein we construct a series of Pt SSCs on heteroatom&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, which exhibit increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along S&#8208;doped, P&#8208;doped, undoped and N&#8208;doped supports. Theoretical simulation indicates a multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process on Pt SSCs due to the low coordination, and a reasonable descriptor is figured out to evaluate the HER activities. Relative to C&#8208;coordinated Pt, N&#8208;coordinated Pt has higher reactivity due to the electron transfer of N&#8208;to&#8208;Pt, which enriches the density of states of Pt 5d orbital near the Fermi level and facilitates the capturing of protons, just the opposite to the situations for P&#8208; and S&#8208;coordinated ones. The stable N&#8208;coordinated Pt originates from the kinetic stability throughout the multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process. This finding provides a significant guidance for rational design of advanced Pt SSCs on carbon&#8208;based supports.

         <title>Unlocking Amides: A General Method for the Self&#8208;Immolative Release of Amide&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methodologies for the self&#8208;immolative release of amide motifs remain scarce despite the prevalence of amides in molecules. Herein, is presented a general and comprehensive strategy for the selective release of a diverse range of amides using a range of common triggers. A stable prodrug of the FDA approved antibiotic linezolid showcased the method and exhibited selective release and equipotency to free linezolid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.







Abstract
The controlled liberation of molecules from a constructed framework is a subject of profound interest across various chemical fields. It allows for the masking of a molecule's properties and precise deployment upon a single controllable release event. While numerous methodologies have been developed for amines, alcohols, and thiols, approaches for utilising amides as payload&#8208;release handles are still in their early stages of development, despite the prevalence of amides in therapeutic compounds and materials. Herein, is presented a comprehensive strategy for the controlled and selective release of a diverse range of amides with stable linkers. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated by its successful application in the targeted release of various amide&#8208;containing drugs in their natural form via the use of commonly used trigger motifs, such as dipeptides or glycosides. As a proof of concept, the FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic linezolid has been successfully converted into a prodrug form and released selectively only in the presence of the trigger event. Significantly, in its prodrug state, no activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was exhibited. Linezolid's full potential was achieved only upon controlled release, where an equipotent efficacy to the free linezolid control was demonstrated, thus emphasising the immense potential of this method.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of Cell&#8208;Surface Proteins via Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy by Using Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy for targeted degradation of cell&#8208;surface proteins with an antibody&#8211;peptide conjugate (Ab&#8208;CMA) is reported, in which a peptide targeting chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) was conjugated with commercially available antibodies for CMA&#8208;based lysosomal degradation of the corresponding antigen independent of specific cell&#8208;surface receptors or E3 ligases, with useful implications for both biochemical research and for therapeutics.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;surface proteins are important drug targets but historically have posed big challenges for the complete elimination of their functions. Herein, we report antibody&#8211;peptide conjugates (Ab&#8208;CMAs) in which a peptide targeting chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) was conjugated with commercially available monoclonal antibodies for specific cell&#8208;surface protein degradation by taking advantage of lysosomal degradation pathways. Unique features of Ab&#8208;CMAs, including cell&#8208;surface receptor&#8208; and E3 ligase&#8208;independent degradation, feasibility towards different cell&#8208;surface proteins (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand&#8197;1 (PD&#8208;L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)) by a simple change of the antibody, and successful tumor inhibition in vivo, make them attractive protein degraders for biomedical research and therapeutic applications. As the first example employing CMA to degrade proteins from the outside in, our findings may also shed new light on CMA, a degradation pathway typically targeting cytosolic proteins.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upcycling and Depolymerization of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As environmental concerns associated with the ultimate fate of polymers grow, researchers are exploring methods to enhance the recycling and sustainability of these ubiquitous materials. Enhanced upcycling, degradation and depolymerization strategies have recently been achieved via photocatalysis and are summarized in this Mini Review.







Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling and depolymerization of vinyl polymers have emerged as promising strategies to combat plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. This mini review critically summarizes current developments in the upcycling and degradation of vinyl polymers including polystyrene and poly(meth)acrylates. Of these material classes, polymethacrylates possess the unique possibility to undergo a photocatalytic depolymerization back to monomer under thermodynamically favourable conditions, thus presenting significant advantages over traditional thermal strategies. Our perspective on current formidable challenges and potential future directions are also discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic upcycling and depolymerization of vinyl polymers have emerged as promising strategies to combat plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. This mini review critically summarizes current developments in the upcycling and degradation of vinyl polymers including polystyrene and poly(meth)acrylates.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell, Single&#8208;Mitochondrial DNA Assay Using Hydrogel Droplet Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While understanding mtDNA heteroplasmy and intercellular heterogeneity requires single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis, existing methods restrict studies to small cell populations. We present a high&#8208;throughput, multiplex method for single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mtDNA analysis using rolling circle amplification and hydrogel droplet microfluidics.







Abstract
There is growing interest in understanding the biological implications of single cell heterogeneity and heteroplasmy of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but current methodologies for single&#8208;cell mtDNA analysis limit the scale of analysis to small cell populations. Although droplet microfluidics have increased the throughput of single&#8208;cell genomic, RNA, and protein analysis, their application to sub&#8208;cellular organelle analysis has remained a largely unsolved challenge. Here, we introduce an agarose&#8208;based droplet microfluidic approach for single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mtDNA analysis, which allows simultaneous processing of hundreds of individual mtDNA molecules within &gt;10,000 individual cells. Our microfluidic chip encapsulates individual cells in agarose beads, designed to have a sufficiently dense hydrogel network to retain mtDNA after lysis and provide a robust scaffold for subsequent multi&#8208;step processing and analysis. To mitigate the impact of the high viscosity of agarose required for mtDNA retention on the throughput of microfluidics, we developed a parallelized device, successfully achieving ~95&#8201;% mtDNA retention from single cells within our microbeads at &gt;700,000 drops/minute. To demonstrate utility, we analyzed specific regions of the single&#8208;mtDNA using a multiplexed rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay. We demonstrated compatibility with both microscopy, for digital counting of individual RCA products, and flow cytometry for higher throughput analysis.

         <title>Second Generation Catalytic Enantioselective Nucleophilic Desymmetrization at Phosphorus (V): Improved Generality, Efficiency and Modularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates.







Abstract
A broadly improved second generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds is described. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a wide range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) containing compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates. A new ureidopeptide BIMP catalyst/thiaziolidinone leaving group combination allowed for a far wider substrate scope and increased reaction efficiency and practicality over previously established protocols. The resulting enantioenriched intermediates could then be transformed into an even greater range of distinct classes of P(V) compounds by displacement of the remaining leaving group as well as allowing for even further diversification downstream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to pinpoint the origin of enantioselectivity for the BIMP&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization, to rationalize how a superior catalyst/leaving group combination leads to increased generality in our second&#8208;generation catalytic system, as well as shed light onto observed stereochemical retention and inversion pathways when performing late&#8208;stage enantiospecific SN2@P reactions with Grignard reagents.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Tailored PVDF&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residual DMF solvents in PVDF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes suffered from inevitably serious side reactions with high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode and lithium metal anode which restrict the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state Li||NCM811 cells. We proposed a novel strategy of anchoring DMF solvents by incorporating low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite molecular sieves as fillers to modulate the solvation structures in PVDF&#8208;based solid state electrolyte. Inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and CEI derived from the tailored anion&#8208;rich solvated structure guarantee long&#8208;term cycling stability of the solid&#8208;state Li||NCM811&#8197;cell at high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3&#8197;V and 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based polymer electro&#8208;lytes are attracting increasing attention for high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries because of their high room temperature ionic conductivity, adequate mechanical strength and good thermal stability. However, the presence of highly reactive residual solvents, such as N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), severely jeopardizes the long&#8208;term cycling stability. Herein, we propose a solvation&#8208;tailoring strategy to confine residual solvent molecules by introducing low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite molecular sieves as fillers. The strong interaction between DMF and the molecular sieve weakens the ability of DMF to participate in the solvation of Li+, leading to more anions being involved in solvation. Benefiting from the tailored anion&#8208;rich coordination environment, the interfacial side reactions with the lithium anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode are effectively suppressed. As a result, the solid&#8208;state Li||Li symmetrical cells demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 5100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li||NCM811 full cells achieve excellent cycling stability for more than 1130 and 250 cycles under the charging cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3&#8197;V and 4.5&#8197;V, respectively. Our work is an innovative exploration to address the negative effects of residual DMF in PVDF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes and highlights the importance of modulating the solvation structures in solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Macrocyclic Dual&#8208;Locked &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; Drug for Selective and Traceless Release in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked approach to embed a small&#8208;molecule drug in a cyclic structure to control bioactivity is described, with the possibility to introduce cell&#8208;targeting entities. Selective and traceless release of the active drug occurs under intracellular conditions found in cancer cells owing to the dual lock and targeting entities.







Abstract
Drug safety and efficacy due to premature release into the bloodstream and poor biodistribution remains a problem despite seminal advances in this area. To circumvent these limitations, we report drug cyclization based on dynamic covalent linkages to devise a dual lock for the small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, camptothecin (CPT). Drug activity is &#8220;locked&#8221; within the cyclic structure by the redox responsive disulfide and pH&#8208;responsive boronic acid&#8208;salicylhydroxamate and turns on only in the presence of acidic pH, reactive oxygen species and glutathione through traceless release. Notably, the dual&#8208;responsive CPT is more active (100&#8208;fold) than the non&#8208;cleavable (permanently closed) analogue. We further include a bioorthogonal handle in the backbone for functionalization to generate cyclic&#8208;locked, cell&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208; and protein&#8208;CPTs, for targeted delivery of the drug and traceless release in triple negative metastatic breast cancer cells to inhibit cell growth at low nanomolar concentrations.

         <title>Engineering NH2&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH2 Triple&#8208;atom Sites in Defective MOFs for Selective Overall Photoreduction of CO2 into CH3COCH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced Cu2+ into the connected nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (Cu&#8208;MOF) and formed special NH2&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH2 catalytic sites for photocatalytic H2O splitting and selective CO2 reduction into acetone. Two amino groups and Cu sites synergistically captured the CO2 molecules and stabilized and decreased the activation energy barriers of the *CO, *CH3, *COCH3, and *COCOCH3 key species, which ultimately produced the C3 product. Finally, Cu&#8208;MOF efficiently converted H2O and CO2 into CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivities up to 97.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Selective photoreduction of CO2 to multicarbon products, is an important but challenging task, due to high CO2 activation barriers and insufficient catalytic sites for C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, a defect engineering strategy for incorporating copper sites into the connected nodes of defective metal&#8211;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for selective overall photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 into acetone. The Cu2+ site in well&#8208;modified CuN2O2 units served as a trapping site to capture electrons via efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, forming the active Cu+ site for CO2 reduction. Two NH2 groups in CuN2O2 unit adsorb CO2 and cooperated with copper ion to functionalize as a triple atom catalytic site, each interacting with one CO2 molecule to strengthen the binding of *CO intermediate to the catalytic site. The deoxygenated *CO attached to the Cu site interacted with *CH3 fixed at one amino group to form the key intermediate CO*&#8208;CH3, which interacted with the third reduction intermediate on another amino group to produce acetone. Our photocatalyst realizes efficient overall CO2 reduction to C3 product acetone CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity up to 97&#8201;% without any adducts, offering a promising avenue for designing triple&#8208;atomic sites to producing C3 product from photosynthesis with water.

         <title>Reductive Doping Inhibits the Formation of Isomerization&#8208;Derived Structural Defects in N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive doping effectively prevents the creation of defects caused by structural changes (isomerization) during the production of n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF). This process involves several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, the integer charge transfer, or the formation of charge transfer complexes, to stop structural isomerization.







Abstract
Recently, solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has been made through in&#8208;situ oxidative polymerization and reductive doping, which exhibited exceptionally high electrical conductivities and optical transparency. The discovery of n&#8208;PBDF is considered a breakthrough in the field of organic semiconductors. In the initial report, the possibility of structural defect formation in n&#8208;PBDF was proposed, based on the observation of structural isomerization from (E)&#8208;2H,2&#8242;H&#8208;[3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuranylidene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dione (isoxindigo) to chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]chromene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione (dibenzonaphthyrone) in the dimer model reactions. In this study, we present clear evidence that structural isomerization is inhibited during polymerization. We reveal that the dimer (BFD1) and the trimer (BFD2) can be reductively doped by several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, forming charge transfer complexes (CTC) or undergoing an integer charge transfer (ICT) with reactants available during polymerization. Once the hydride transfer adducts, the CTC, or the ICT product forms, structural isomerization can be effectively prevented even at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of why isomerization&#8208;derived structural defects are absent in n&#8208;PBDF backbone. It lays a solid foundation for the future development of n&#8208;PBDF as a benchmark polymer for organic electronics and beyond.

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Programmed Biosynthesis of Heterotrimeric Fungal Depside Thielavin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyketide synthase ThiA that forms the heterotrimeric fungal depside thielavin A (1) has been identified and characterized. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ThiA was found to perform two consecutive esterification reactions as well as subsequent hydrolysis, and a plausible reaction mechanism for the TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions has been proposed. Furthermore, this study provides insights into how ThiA selectivity yields the heterotrimeric product.







Abstract
Thielavin A (1) is a fungal depside composed of one 3&#8208;methylorsellinic acid and two 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid units. It displays diverse biological activities. However, the mechanism underlying the assembly of the heterotrimeric structure of 1 remains to be clarified. In this study, we identified the polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of 1. This PKS, designated as ThiA, possesses an unusual domain organization with the C&#8208;methyltransferase (MT) domain situated at the C&#8208;terminus following the thioesterase (TE) domain. Our findings indicated that the TE domain is solely responsible for two rounds of ester bond formation, along with subsequent chain hydrolysis. We identified a plausible mechanism for TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions and obtained insights into how a single PKS can selectively yield a specific heterotrimeric product. In particular, the tandem acyl carrier protein domains of ThiA are critical for programmed methylation by the MT domain. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence of highly optimized domain&#8211;domain communication within ThiA for the selective synthesis of 1, which can advance our understanding of the programming rules of fungal PKSs.

         <title>Designing Degradable Polymers from Tricycloalkenes via Complete Cascade Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
we disclosed a complete cascade RORCMP using tricycloalkenes. We found trans tricycloalkenes enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP with TON ~10,000 and Mn up to 170&#8197;kg/mol. Also, one&#8208;shot cascade MOMP was achieved to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation.







Abstract
Cascade metathesis polymerization has been developed as a promising method to synthesize complex but well&#8208;defined polymers from monomers containing multiple reactive functional groups. However, this approach has been limited to the monomers involving simple alkene/alkyne moieties or produced mainly non&#8208;degradable polymers. In this study, we demonstrate a complete cascade ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization (RORCMP) using various tricycloalkenes and two strategies for the efficient degradation. Through rational design of tricycloalkene monomers, the structure and reactivity relationship was explored. For example, tricycloalkenes with trans configuration in the central ring enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP than the corresponding cis isomers. Also, a 4&#8208;substituted cyclopentene moiety in the monomers significantly enhanced the overall cascade RORCMP performance, with the maximum turnover number (TON) reaching almost 10,000 and molecular weight up to 170&#8197;kg/mol using an amide&#8208;containing monomer. Furthermore, we achieved one&#8208;shot cascade multiple olefin metathesis polymerization using tricycloalkenes and a diacrylate, to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we successfully designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation under mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Cascade metathesis polymerization has been developed as a promising method to synthesize complex but well-defined polymers from monomers containing multiple reactive functional groups. However, this approach has been limited to the monomers involving simple alkene/alkyne moieties or produced mainly non-degradable polymers. In this study, we demonstrate a complete cascade ring-opening/ring-closing metathesis polymerization (RORCMP) using various tricycloalkenes and two strategies for the efficient degradation. Through rational design of tricycloalkene monomers, the structure and reactivity relationship was explored. For example, tricycloalkenes with &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; configuration in the central ring enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP than the corresponding &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers. Also, a 4-substituted cyclopentene moiety in the monomers significantly enhanced the overall cascade RORCMP performance, with the maximum turnover number (TON) reaching almost 10,000 and molecular weight up to 170&#8197;kg/mol using an amide-containing monomer. Furthermore, we achieved one-shot cascade multiple olefin metathesis polymerization using tricycloalkenes and a diacrylate, to produce new highly A,B-alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we successfully designed xylose-based tricycloalkenes to give well-defined polymers that underwent ultra-fast and complete degradation under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Biocatalysts for the C&#8722;H Activation of Fatty Acids by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of biocatalysts for the regioselective mid&#8208; and end&#8208;chain C&#8722;H activation of fatty acids to generate hydroxy acids is described. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was successfully applied to the multidomain enzyme family of CYP116B cytochrome P450 monooxygenases to generate ancestor variants with distinct product and thermostability profiles.







Abstract
Selective, one&#8208;step C&#8722;H activation of fatty acids from biomass is an attractive concept in sustainable chemistry. Biocatalysis has shown promise for generating high&#8208;value hydroxy acids, but to date enzyme discovery has relied on laborious screening and produced limited hits, which predominantly oxidise the subterminal positions of fatty acids. Herein we show that ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is an effective tool to explore the sequence&#8208;activity landscape of a family of multidomain, self&#8208;sufficient P450 monooxygenases. We resurrected 11 catalytically active CYP116B ancestors, each with a unique regioselectivity fingerprint that varied from subterminal in the older ancestors to mid&#8208;chain in the lineage leading to the extant, P450&#8208;TT. In lineages leading to extant enzymes in thermophiles, thermostability increased from ancestral to extant forms, as expected if thermophily had arisen de novo. Our studies show that ASR can be applied to multidomain enzymes to develop active, self&#8208;sufficient monooxygenases as regioselective biocatalysts for fatty acid hydroxylation.

         <title>Accessing Mg&#8208;Ion Storage in V2PS10 via Combined Cationic&#8208;Anionic Redox with Selective Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
V2PS10 achieves reversible capacity of 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with fast Mg2+ insertion kinetics. Insertion is accompanied by simultaneous anionic and cationic redox on spatially separated sites. The nature of the electron transfer depends on the coordination of individual Mg sites by the distinct sulphur species involved, creating synergy between specific site occupancies and the selective cleavage of one of the two chemically distinct sets of S&#8722;S bonds.







Abstract
Magnesium batteries attract interest as alternative energy&#8208;storage devices because of elemental abundance and potential for high energy density. Development is limited by the absence of suitable cathodes, associated with poor diffusion kinetics resulting from strong interactions between Mg2+ and the host structure. V2PS10 is reported as a positive electrode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries. Cyclable capacity of 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved with fast Mg2+ diffusion of 7.2
10&#8722;11&#8211;4
10&#8722;14&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1. The fast insertion mechanism results from combined cationic redox on the V site and anionic redox on the (S2)2&#8722; site; enabled by reversible cleavage of S&#8722;S bonds, identified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Detailed structural characterisation with maximum entropy method analysis, supported by density functional theory and projected density of states analysis, reveals that the sulphur species involved in anion redox are not connected to the transition metal centres, spatially separating the two redox processes. This facilitates fast and reversible Mg insertion in which the nature of the redox process depends on the cation insertion site, creating a synergy between the occupancy of specific Mg sites and the location of the electrons transferred.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Asymmetric Backbone for Highly Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.7&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules, namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTM in organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the system of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;eC9. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.7&#8201;%, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of storage at air ambient.







Abstract
The hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS), is the most widely used material in the realization of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the stability of PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS&#8208;based OSCs is quite poor, arising from its strong acidity and hygroscopicity. In addition, PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS has an absorption in the infrared region and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, thus limiting the enhancement of short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. Herein, two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs), namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTM in binary OSCs based on the well&#8208;known system of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;eC9. Compared with BrCz, BrBACz shows larger dipole moment, deeper work function and lower surface energy. Moreover, BrBACz not only enhances photon harvesting in the active layer, but also minimizes voltage losses as well as improves interface charge extraction/ transport. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz as HTM exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.70&#8201;% with a remarkable Jsc of 29.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Voc of 0.856&#8197;V, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs so far. In addition, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of storage at air ambient, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Triazine Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine frameworks were employed as metal&#8208;free visible light photocatalysts for the efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons under ambient conditions. The catalytic efficiency of the meticulously crafted thiophene&#8208;based CTF was remarkably similar to that of transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysts previously reported. This not only highlights the potential of CTFs but also enhances our comprehension of the mechanisms governing effective C&#8722;H activation within photocatalytic polymers.







Abstract
Investigations into the selective oxidation of inert sp3 C&#8722;H bonds using polymer photocatalysts under mild conditions have been limited. Additionally, the structure&#8208;activity relationship of photocatalysts often remains insufficiently explored. Here, a series of thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are used for the efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to aldehydes or ketones under ambient aerobic conditions. Spectroscopic methods conducted in situ and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the sulfur atoms within the thiophene units play a pivotal role as oxidation sites due to the generation of photogenerated holes. The effect of photogenerated holes on photocatalytic toluene oxidation was investigated by varying the length of the spacer in a CTF donor&#8208;acceptor based photocatalyst. Furthermore, the manipulation of reactive oxygen species was employed to enhance selectivity by weakening the peroxidative capacity. As an illustrative example, this study successfully demonstrated the synthesis of a precursor of the neurological drug AMG&#8208;579 using a photocatalytic protocol.

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Interphases Regulated by Trace Dual Electrolyte Additives for Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid aqueous electrolyte of ZnSO4 with trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate enables ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anode by virtue of D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species alternately and reversibly adsorb on Zn surface to form dynamical molecular interphases and enter Zn2+ solvation sheath to boost de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits exceptional stability for &gt;6400&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Metallic zinc is a promising anode material for rechargeable aqueous multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries due to its high capacity and low cost. However, the practical use is always beset by severe dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions occurring at anode/electrolyte interface. Here we demonstrate dynamic molecular interphases caused by trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate for ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. Triggered by plating and stripping electric fields, the D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species are alternately and reversibly (de&#8208;)adsorbed on Zn metal, respectively, to accelerate Zn2+ transportation for uniform Zn nucleation and deposition and inhibit side reactions for high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating behaviors for &gt;6400&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which enables long&#8208;term cycling stability of Zn||ZnxMnO2 full cell for more than 2000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecule Aggregation for Nearly Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Sol Electrolyte to Advanced Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries: The Case of Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal as a promising anode of aqueous batteries faces the severe challenges from dendrite growth and side reactions. Here, tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS) is explored as an electrolyte additive for advanced Zn anodes. It is interesting to note that TPPS spontaneously assembles into unique aggregates. As they adsorb on the Zn anode, the aggregates enhance the resistance to electrolyte percolation and dendrite growth compared to the reported single molecules. Meanwhile, TPPS facilitates anion association in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, and boosts the transference number of Zn2+ up to 0.95. Therefore, anion&#8208;related side reactions and anion&#8208;induced electrode overpotentials are reduced accordingly. In this context, the electrolyte containing TPPS exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance. Even under a high loading of MnO2 (25 mg cm&#8208;2), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.7), and a lean electrolyte (15 uL mAh&#8208;1), the full cells still represent a higher cumulative capacity compared to the reported data. The advantages of this electrolyte are also adapted to other cathode materials. The pouch cells of Zn|| NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O realize a capacity of ~0.35 Ah at 0.4 C under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Promoted Activation of N2O, Amine, and H2 as well as Catalytic Hydrogenation of Imines, Quinoline, and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond activation and catalysis using s&#8208;block metals are of great significance but underexplored. Herein, a series of calcium pincer complexes with deprotonated side arms have been prepared using pyridine&#8208;based PNP and PNN ligands. The complexes were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystal diffraction. Utilizing the obtained calcium complexes, unprecedented N2O activation by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) involving dearomatization&#8208;aromatization of the pyridine ligand was achieved, generating aromatized calcium diazotate complexes as products. Additionally, the dearomatized calcium complexes were able to activate the N&#8211;H bond as well as reversibly activate H2, offering an opportunity for the catalytic hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules. DFT calculations were applied to analyze the electronic structures of the synthesized complexes and explore possible reaction mechanisms. This study is an important complement to the area of MLC and main&#8208;group metal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Minimalistic Covalent Bond&#8208;Forming Chemical Reaction Cycle that Consumes Adenosine Diphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of active matter requires the ability to design materials capable of harnessing energy from a source to carry out work. Nature achieves this using chemical reaction cycles in which energy released from an exergonic chemical reaction is used to drive biochemical processes. Although many chemically fuelled synthetic reaction cycles&#160;have been reported, the generally high complexity of the reported systems hampers a full understanding of how the available chemical energy is actually exploited by these systems. This lack of understanding is a limiting factor in the design of active matter. Here, we report a minimalistic reaction cycle in which adenosine diphosphate (ADP) triggers the formation of a catalyst for its own hydrolysis. This establishes an interdependence between the concentrations of the network components resulting in the transient formation of the catalyst. The network is sufficiently simple that all kinetic and thermodynamic parameters governing its behaviour can be characterised, allowing kinetic models to be built that simulate the progress of reactions within the network. While the current network does not enable the ADP&#8208;hydrolysis reaction to populate a nonequilibrium composition, these models provide insight into the way the network dissipates energy. Furthermore, design principles are revealed for constructing driven systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilization of Amino&#8208;site into a Pore&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Separation of Propyne/Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation of propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) is a crucial yet complex process, however, it remains a great difficulty in developing porous materials that can meet the requirements for practical applications, particularly with an exceptional ability to bind and store trace amounts of C3H4. Functionalization of pore&#8208;partitioned metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ppMOFs) is methodically suited for this challenge owing to the possibility of dramatically increasing binding sites on highly porous and confined domains. We here immobilized Lewis&#8208;basic (&#8208;NH2) and Lewis&#8208;acidic (&#8208;NO2) sites on this platform. Along with an integrated nature of high uptake of C3H4 at 1 kPa, high uptake difference of C3H4&#8208;C3H6, moderated binding strength, promoted kinetic selectivity, trapping effect and high stability, the NH2&#8208;decorated ppMOF (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2) can efficiently produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 (99.95%, 8.3 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1) at room temperature, which is six times more than the NO2&#8208;decorated crystal (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NO2). The in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, crystallographic analysis, and sequential blowing tests showed that the densely packed amino group in this highly porous system has a unique ability to recognize and stabilize C3H4 molecules. Moving forward, the strategy of organic functionalization can be extended to other porous systems, making it a powerful tool to customize advanced materials for challenging tasks.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stoichiometric Haloform Coupling for Ester Synthesis with Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The haloform reaction from methyl ketones to carboxylic acids is one of the oldest known synthetic organic reactions and has been used in myriad applications over the decades. The corresponding reaction to produce esters is, however, less developed, as the reaction is generally limited to simple, primary alcohols that are used in solvent&#8208;level quantities, thereby restricting the complexity of esters that can be directly formed. Herein, we detail the development of a general ester&#8209;forming haloform coupling reaction using one equivalent of alcohol. Mechanistic and kinetic modelling studies demonstrated that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which facilitated the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells Enabled by 1, 2, 4&#8208;Selenadiazole&#8208;Containing Crystalline Small Molecule with Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer morphology is recognized as an ideal structure facilitating exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed OSCs (LbL&#8208;OSCs), polymer donors and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are separately deposited, and it is challenging to realize a fibril network of pure SMAs with the absence of tight interchain entanglement as polymers. In this work, crystalline small molecule donors (SMDs), named TDZ&#8208;3TR and SeDZ&#8208;3TR, were designed and introduced into the L8&#8208;BO acceptor solution, forcing the phase separation and molecular fibrilization. SeDZ&#8208;3TR showed higher crystallinity and lower miscibility with L8&#8208;BO acceptor than TDZ&#8208;3TR, enabling more driving force to favor the phase separation and better molecular fibrilization of L8&#8208;BO. On the other hand, two donor polymers of PM6 and D18 with different fibril widths and lengths were put together to optimize the fibril network of the donor layer. The simultaneously optimization of the acceptor and donor layers resulted in a more ideal double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer and an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38% in LbL&#8208;OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bending, Twisting, and Propulsion of Photoreactive Crystals by Controlled Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid release of gas by a chemical reaction to generate momentum is one of the most fundamental ways to elicit motion that could be used to sustain and control the motility of objects. We report that hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in liquid media. In needle&#8208;like regular crystals, the reaction occurs mainly on the surface and results in the formation of cracks that evolve due to internal pressure; the expansion on the cracked surface of the crystal results in bending, twisting, or coiling of the crystal. In hollow crystals, gas accumulates inside their cavity and emanates preferentially from the recess at the crystal terminus, propelling the crystal to undergo directional photomechanical motion through the liquid. The motility of the object which can be controlled externally to perform work delineates the concept of &#8220;crystal microbots&#8221;, realized by photoreactive organic crystals where prolonged directional motion for actuation or delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Photochromic Silver(I) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Alternative Topology, Dynamic Photoluminescence and Efficient Photothermal Conversion Modulated by Anionic Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photogenerated radicals are an indispensable member of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photochromic material family, as they can effectively modulate the photoluminescence and photothermal conversion performance of radical&#8208;induced photochromic complexes. Herein, two novel radical&#8208;induced photochromic metal&#8210;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Ag(TEPE)](AC)&#8901;7/4H2O&#8901;5/4EtOH (1) and [Ag(TEPE)](NC)&#8901;3H2O&#8901;EtOH (2), are reported. Distinctly different topological networks can be obtained by judiciously introducing alternative &#960;&#8211;conjugated anionic guests, including a new topological structure (named as sfm) first reported in this work, describing as 4,4,4,4&#8208;c net. EPR data and UV&#8208;Vis spectra prove the radical&#8208;induced photochromic mechanism. Dynamic photochromism exhibits tunability in a wide CIE color space, with a linear segment from yellow to red for 1, while a curved coordinate line for 2, resulting in colorful emission from blue to orange. Moreover, photogenerated TEPE* radicals effectively activate the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion effect of MOFs. Under 1 W cm&#8208;2 808 nm laser irradiation, the surface temperatures of photoproducts 1* and 2* can reach ~160 &#8451; and ~120 &#8451;, respectively, with competitive NIR photothermal conversion efficiencies &#951; = 51.8% (1*) and 36.2% (2*). This work develops a feasible electrostatic compensation strategy to accurately introduce photoactive anionic guests into MOFs to construct multifunctional radical&#8208;induced photothermal conversion materials with tunable photoluminescence behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Superoxide Radicals in Uranyl Peroxide Solids: Lasting Signatures Identified by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>U(VI) peroxide phases (studtite and meta&#8208;studtite) are found throughout the nuclear fuel cycle and exist as corrosion products in high radiation fields.&#160; Peroxides are part of a family of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that include hydroperoxyl and superoxide species and are produced during alpha radiolysis of water.&#160; While U(VI) peroxides have been thoroughly investigated, the incorporation and stability of ROS species within studtite have not been validated. In the current study, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to identify the presence of free radicals within a series of U(VI) peroxide samples containing depleted, weapons&#8208;grade, and natural uranium.&#160; Density functional theory calculations indicated that the predicted EPR signals matched well with a superoxide (O2&#8208;&#8226;) species incorporated into the studtite structure, confirming the presence of ROS in the material. Further analysis of samples that were synthesized between 1945 and 2023 indicated that there is a correlation between the radical signal and the product of specific activity multiplied by age of the sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerized Acceptors with Conjugate&#8208;Break Linker Enable Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing new acceptors is critical for intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) with high efficiency and mechanical robustness. However, nearly all stretchable polymer acceptors exhibit limited efficiency and high&#8208;performance small molecular acceptors are very brittle. In this regard, we select thienylene&#8208;alkane&#8208;thienylene (TAT) as the conjugate&#8208;break linker and synthesize four dimerized acceptors by the regulation of connecting sites and halogen substitutions. It is found that the connecting sites and halogen substitutions considerably impact the overall electronic structures, aggregation behaviors, and charge transport properties. Benefiting from the optimization of the molecular structure, the dimerized acceptor exhibits rational phase separation within the blend films, which significantly facilitates exciton dissociation while effectively suppressing charge recombination processes. Consequently, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid OSCs render the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.07% among reported acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linker. Most importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based IS&#8208;OSCs achieve high PCE (14.29%) and remarkable stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 18.23%), significantly surpassing Y6&#8208;based counterpart (PCE = 12.80% and COS = 8.50%). To sum up, these findings demonstrate that dimerized acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linkers have immense potential in developing highly efficient and mechanically robust OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Pd/Organoboron&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Carbohydrate Functionalization with Alkoxyallenes Involving Noncovalent Stereocontrol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate the robustness of a synergistic chiral Pd/organoboron system in tackling a challenging suite of site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity issues across a considerable palette of biologically relevant carbohydrate polyols, when prochiral alkoxyallenes were employed as electrophiles. In view of the burgeoning role of noncovalent interactions (NCIs) in stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis, our mechanistic experiments and DFT modeling of the reaction path unexpectedly revealed that NCIs such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between the resting states of the Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl complex and the borinate saccharide are critically involved in the stereoselectivity control. Our strategy thus illuminates the untapped potential of harnessing NCIs in the context of transition metal catalysis to tackle stereoselectivity challenges in carbohydrate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude Enhancement of Photoinitiation Activity via A Simple Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of high&#8208;performance photoinitiator is the key to enhance the printing speed, structure resolution and product quality in 3D laser printing. Here, to improve the printing efficiency of 3D laser nanoprinting, we investigate the underlying photochemistry of gold and silver nanocluster initiators under multiphoton laser excitation. Experimental results and DFT calculations reveal the high cleavage probability of the surface S&#8208;C bonds in gold and silver nanoclusters which generate multiple radicals. Based on this understanding, we design several alkyl&#8208;thiolated gold nanoclusters and achieve a more than two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of photoinitiation activity, as well as a significant improvement in printing resolution and fabrication window. Overall, this work for the first time unveils the detailed radical formation pathways of gold and silver nanoclusters under multiphoton activation and substantially improves their photoinitiation sensitivity via surface engineering, which pushes the limit of the printing efficiency of 3D laser lithography.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Supporting Atomic Bi&#8722;N2O2&#160;Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic CO2&#160;Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>Single atomic catalysts (SACs) offer a superior platform for studying the structure&#8208;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to obtain well&#8208;defined and novel site configuration owing to the uncertainty of functional framework&#8208;derived SACs through calcination.&#160;Herein, a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2&#160;site supported on the (1 1 0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) is reported directly for CO2RR.&#160;In flow cell, the target catalyst Bi1&#8208;HOF maintains a faradaic efficiency (FE) HCOOH of over 90% at a wide potential window of 1.4 V.&#160; The corresponding partial current density ranges from 113.3 to 747.0 mA cm&#8722;2. And, Bi1&#8208;HOF exhibits a long&#8208;term stability of over 30 h under a successive potential&#8208;step test with a current density of 100~400 mA cm&#8722;2. Density function theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1 1 0) plane of HOF effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from Bi center to CO2 molecule, reaching an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. Besides, this study offers a versatile method to reach series of M&#8722;N2O2 sites with regulable metal centers via the same intercalation mechanism, broadening the platform for studying the&#160;structure&#8208;activity relationships during CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chiral B&#8722;N Adduct as a New Frontier in Ferroelectrics and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral B&#8722;N adduct [RC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (RMBA&#8208;BF3) was synthesized and found to display excellent ferroelectric polarization, as established by experimental and theoretical characterizations. Mechanical energy harvesting devices made from its as&#8208;made crystals were shown to exhibit efficient piezoelectric nanogenerator output performance.







Abstract
Within the burgeoning field of electronic materials, B&#8722;N Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, distinguished by their partial charge distribution across boron and nitrogen centers, represent an underexplored class with significant potential. These materials exhibit inherent dipoles and are excellent candidates for ferroelectricity. However, the challenge lies in achieving the optimal combination of hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base pairs to yield B&#8722;N adducts with stable dipoles. Herein, we present an enantiomeric pair of B&#8722;N adducts [R/SC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (R/SMBA&#8208;BF3) crystallizing in the polar monoclinic P21 space group. The ferroelectric measurements on RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave a rectangular P&#8208;E hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization of 7.65&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a value that aligns with the polarization derived from the extensive density&#8208;functional theory computations. The PFM studies on the drop&#8208;casted film of RMBA&#8208;BF3 further corroborate the existence of ferroelectric domains, displaying characteristic amplitude&#8208;bias butterfly and phase&#8208;bias hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA&#8208;BF3 was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5&#8197;pC&#8201;N&#8722;1 for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as&#8208;made crystals of RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2&#8197;V. This work thus underscores the untapped potential of B&#8722;N adducts in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.

         <title>The Versatile Establishment of Charge Storage in Polymer Solid Electrolyte with Enhanced Charge Transfer for LiF&#8208;Rich SEI Generation in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin covalent organic framework (POF) with &#8220;charge storage&#8221; properties is designed and integrated into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to investigate the impact of adequate charge transfer on lithium salt decomposition. The results show that LiTFSI can obtain sufficient charge from POF to promote the formation of LiF&#8208;rich SEl layer, thus improving the cycling performance of the battery.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;state electrolyte interface (SEI) between the solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte and the lithium metal anode dramatically affects the overall battery performance. Increasing the content of lithium fluoride (LiF) in SEI can help the uniform deposition of lithium and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites, thus improving the cycle stability performance of lithium batteries. Currently, most methods of constructing LiF SEI involve decomposing the lithium salt by the polar groups of the filler. However, there is a lack of research reports on how to affect the SEI layer of Li&#8208;ion batteries by increasing the charge transfer number. In this study, a porous organic polymer with &#8220;charge storage&#8221; properties was prepared and doped into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to study the effect of sufficient charge transfer on the decomposition of lithium salts. The results show in contrast to porphyrins, the unique structure of POF allows for charge transfer between each individual porphyrin. Therefore, during TFSI&#8722; decomposition to the formation of LiF, TFSI&#8722; can obtain sufficient charge, thereby promoting the break of C&#8722;F and forming the LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Compared with single porphyrin (0.423&#8197;e&#8722;), POF provides 2.7&#8197;times more charge transfer to LiTFSI (1.147&#8197;e&#8722;). The experimental results show that Li//Li symmetric batteries equipped with PEO&#8208;POF can be operated stably for more than 2700&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Even the Li//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) symmetric cells are stable for more than 1100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In addition, LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li batteries have excellent cycling performance at 2&#8197;C (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 750 cycles). Even LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) cells have excellent cycling performance at 1&#8197;C (96&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Even when the PEO&#8208;base is replaced with a PEG&#8208;base and a PVDF&#8208;base, the performance of the cell is still significantly improved. Therefore, we believe that the concept of charge transfer offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance assemblies.

Therefore, during TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition to the formation of LiF, TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can obtain sufficient charge, thereby promoting the break of C&#8722;F and forming the LiF-rich SEI. Compared with single porphyrin (0.423&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), POF provides 2.7&#8197;times more charge transfer to LiTFSI (1.147&#8197;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). The experimental results show that Li//Li symmetric batteries equipped with PEO-POF can be operated stably for more than 2700&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Even the Li//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) symmetric cells are stable for more than 1100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;//PEO-POF//Li batteries have excellent cycling performance at 2&#8197;C (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 750 cycles). Even LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;//PEO-POF//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) cells have excellent cycling performance at 1&#8197;C (96&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Even when the PEO-base is replaced with a PEG-base and a PVDF-base, the performance of the cell is still significantly improved. Therefore, we believe that the concept of charge transfer offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high-performance assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Compatible Gel&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by NaF&#8208;Solubility&#8208;Regulation toward All&#8208;Climate Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>

In the designed &#8220;salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer&#8221; gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte, dissolved NaF salt occupies free solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment and added aggregates, which induced stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. It delivers enhanced Na+ transport kinetics from electrolyte to interface and high compatibility with different cathodes and anodes. The assembled solid&#8208;state Na&#8201;||&#8201;Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a pragmatic choice for high&#8208;safety sodium batteries but still plagued by interfacial compatibility with both cathode and anode simultaneously. Here, salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer fibers with NaF salt inlaid in polylactide (PLA) fiber network was fabricated via electrospinning and subsequent in situ forming gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte in liquid electrolytes. The obtained PLA&#8208;NaF GPE achieves a high ion conductivity (2.50&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and large Na+ transference number (0.75) at ambient temperature. Notably, the dissolution of NaF salt occupies solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment, which facilitates aggregates with increased anionic coordination (anion/Na+ &gt;1). Aggregates with higher HOMO realize the preferential oxidation on the cathode so that inorganic&#8208;rich and stable CEI covers cathode&#8217; surface, preventing particles&#8217; breakage and showing good compatibility with different cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)3, Na2+2xFe2&#8208;x(SO4)3, Na0.72Ni0.32Mn0.68O2, NaTi2(PO4)3). While, passivated Na anode induced by the lower LUMO of aggregates, and the lower surface tension between Na anode and PLA&#8208;NaF GPE interface, leading to the dendrites&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the assembled Na&#8201;||&#8201;Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Pyrene&#8208;Based Hole Transporting Material Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Py&#8208;DB with an extended conjugated structure is an effective dopant&#8208;free HTM when applied in n&#8208;i&#8208;p&#8208;type PSCs, affording an efficiency of 24.33&#8201;%, the highest PCE for a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM.







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is significant to the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we developed a novel star&#8208;shape arylamine HTM, termed Py&#8208;DB, with a pyrene core and carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds as the bridge units. Compared to the reference HTM (termed Py&#8208;C), the extension of the planar conjugation backbone endows Py&#8208;DB with typical intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions and excellent solubility, resulting in improved hole mobility and film morphology. In addition, the lower HOMO energy level of the Py&#8208;DB HTM provides efficient hole extraction with reduced energy loss at the perovskite/HTM interface. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.33&#8201;% was achieved for dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based PSCs, which is the highest PCE for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p configured PSCs. The dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based device also exhibits improved long&#8208;term stability, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h exposure to 25&#8201;% humidity at 60&#8201;&#176;C. These findings provide valuable insights and approaches for the further development of dopant&#8208;free HTMs for efficient and reliable PSCs.

         <title>Appending Coronene Diimide with Carbon Nanohoops Allows for Rapid Intersystem Crossing in Neat Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8221; type coronene diimide&#8208;core double nanohoop (CDI&#8211;CPP), which has significant intra&#8211; and intermolecular charge&#8211;transfer interactions in the solid state, was designed and synthesized. CDI&#8211;CPP can undergo rapid intersystem crossing in neat film with a time constant of 238&#8197;ps.







Abstract
The development of innovative triplet materials plays a significant role in various applications. Although effective tuning of triplet formation by intersystem crossing (ISC) has been well established in solution, the modulation of ISC processes in the solid state remains a challenge due to the presence of other exciton decay channels through intermolecular interactions. The cyclic structure of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) offers a unique platform to tune the intermolecular packing, which leads to controllable exciton dynamics in the solid state. Herein, by integrating an electron deficient coronene diimide (CDI) unit into the CPP framework, a donor&#8208;acceptor type of conjugated macrocycle (CDI&#8208;CPP) featuring intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interaction was designed and synthesized. Effective intermolecular CT interaction resulting from a slipped herringbone packing was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Transient spectroscopy studies showed that CDI&#8208;CPP undergoes ISC in both solution and the film state, with triplet generation time constants of 4.5&#8197;ns and 238&#8197;ps, respectively. The rapid triplet formation through ISC in the film state can be ascribed to the cooperation between intra&#8208; and intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interactions. Our results highlight that intermolecular CT interaction has a pronounced effect on the ISC process in the solid state, and shed light on the use of the characteristic structure of CPPs to manipulate intermolecular CT interactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview article highlights the role of sulfur in enhancing sustainable carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions for emerging organic synthesis goals. A unique combination of sulfur properties is emphasized for initiating radical transformations and facilitating waste&#8208;free processes, offering significant advancements and new eco&#8208;friendly synthesis directions.







Abstract
This review explores the pivotal role of sulfur in advancing sustainable carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling reactions. The unique electronic properties of sulfur, as a soft Lewis base with significant mesomeric effect make it an excellent candidate for initiating radical transformations, directing C&#8722;H&#8208;activation, and facilitating cycloaddition and C&#8722;S bond dissociation reactions. These attributes are crucial for developing waste&#8208;free methodologies in green chemistry. Our mini&#8208;review is focused on existing sulfur&#8208;directed C&#8722;C coupling techniques, emphasizing their sustainability and comparing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with traditional approaches. The review highlights the importance of this research in addressing current challenges in organic synthesis and catalysis. The innovative use of sulfur in photocatalytic, electrochemical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes not only exemplifies significant advancements in the field but also opens new avenues for environmentally friendly chemical processes. By focusing on atom economy and waste minimization, the analysis provides broad appeal and potential for future developments in sustainable organic chemistry.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Allysine for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic approach was developed for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of the side chain of dimethyl lysine. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope and modifies dimethyl lysine and tertiary amines to form aldehydes in small molecules, peptides, proteins and cells.







Abstract
Inspired by the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which selectively converts the side chain of lysine into allysine, an aldehyde&#8208;containing post&#8208;translational modification, we report herein the first chemical method for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of dimethyl lysine. This approach is highly chemoselective for dimethyl lysine on proteins. We highlight the utility of this biomimetic approach for generating aldehydes in a variety of pharmaceutically active linear and cyclic peptides at a late stage for their diversification with various affinity and fluorescent tags. Notably, we utilized this approach for generating small&#8208;molecule aldehydes from the corresponding tertiary amines. We further demonstrated the potential of this approach in generating cellular models for studying allysine&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Regulating Lateral Adsorbate Interaction for Efficient Electroreforming of Bio&#8208;polyols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation was proposed. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which effectively tuned the adsorption energies and tailored the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products.







Abstract
Tailoring the selectivity at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface is one of the greatest challenges for heterogeneous electrocatalysis, and complementary strategies to catalyst structural designs need to be developed. Herein, we proposed a new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways by lateral adsorbate interaction for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion possesses the alcoholic property that facilely adsorbs on the nickel oxyhydroxide catalyst, but is resistant to oxidation due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl groups. The alien HFIP adsorbents can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which achieved a &gt;2&#8208;fold enhancement of the oxalate selectivity to 55&#8201;% for the representative glycerol oxidation and can be extended to various bio&#8208;polyol substrates. Through in situ spectroscopic analysis and DFT calculation on the glycerol oxidation, we reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded adsorbate interaction can effectively tune the adsorption energies and tailor the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products. This work offers an additional perspective of tuning electrocatalytic reactions via introducing redox&#8208;innocent adsorbates to create lateral adsorbate interactions.

         <title>An Enzymatic Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage and Aldol Reaction Cascade Converts an Angular Scaffold into the Linear Tetracyclic Core of Ochraceopones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones originates from a common angular tetracycle through a cascade of enzymatic C&#8722;C bond cleavage and construction. The multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH facilitates the cleavage of a C&#8722;C bond in the angular tetracycle by an unprecedented free&#8208;radical&#8208;initiated process. The subsequent new aldolase OchL constructs a C&#8722;C bond through an aldol reaction to generate the linear tetracycle.







Abstract
Meroterpenoids of the ochraceopones family featuring a linear tetracyclic scaffold exhibit exceptional antiviral and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. The biosynthetic pathway and chemical logic to generate this linear tetracycle, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized all biosynthetic enzymes to afford ochraceopones and elucidated the complete biosynthetic pathway. We demonstrated that the linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones was derived from an angular tetracyclic precursor. A multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH was validated to catalyze the free&#8208;radical&#8208;initiated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage of the angular tetracycle. Then, a new carbon&#8208;carbon bond was verified to be constructed using a new aldolase OchL, which catalyzes an intramolecular aldol reaction to form the linear tetracycle. This carbon&#8208;carbon bond fragmentation and aldol reaction cascade features an unprecedented strategy for converting a common angular tetracycle to a distinctive linear tetracyclic scaffold in meroterpenoid biosynthesis.

         <title>Boosted Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH by Rhenium Atomically Dispersed on Indium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2Re&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst with atomically dispersed Re boosts selective CH3OH formation in sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2. The atomically dispersed Re is beneficial for CO2 conversion to CO which is strongly adsorbed on 2Re&#8208;In2O3 and prefers to undergo hydrogenation to CH3OH rather than desorption from 2Re&#8208;In2O3, thus boosting CH3OH formation. This opens a new way to improve sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free selective photoreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven photoreduction of CO2 is promising in alleviating environment burden, but suffers from low efficiency and over&#8208;reliance on sacrificial agents. Herein, rhenium (Re) is atomically dispersed in In2O3 to fabricate a 2Re&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst. In sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2 with H2O, 2Re&#8208;In2O3 shows a long&#8208;term stable efficiency which is enhanced by 3.5 times than that of pure In2O3 and is also higher than those on Au&#8208;In2O3, Ag&#8208;In2O3, Cu&#8208;In2O3, Ir&#8208;In2O3, Ru&#8208;In2O3, Rh&#8208;In2O3 and Pt&#8208;In2O3 photocatalysts. Moreover, carbon&#8208;based product of the photoreduction overturns from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. Re promotes charge separation, H2O dissociation and CO2 activation, thus enhancing photoreduction efficiency of CO2 on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. During the photoreduction, CO is a key intermediate. CO prefers to desorption rather than hydrogenation on pure In2O3, as CO binds to pure In2O3 very weakly. Re strengthens the interaction of CO with 2Re&#8208;In2O3 by 5.0 times, thus limiting CO desorption but enhancing CO hydrogenation to CH3OH. This could be the origin for photoreduction product overturn from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. The present work opens a new way to boost sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2.

We introduce and entirely new dynamic, non&#8208;covalent bonding interaction based on selenadiazole chalcogen squares which are capable of tuning bulk glass transition temperature, increase toughness, imbue self&#8208;healing abilities, and control hydrodynamic diameter of solvated macromolecular architectures. All of these properties can be accessed via a single selenadiazole containing molecule, easily and quickly incorporated into a broad array of polymer systems via Passerini and Biginelli multicomponent reactions.







Abstract
Herein we introduce chalcogen squares via selenadiazole motifs as a new class of dynamic supramolecular bonding interactions for the modification and control of soft matter materials. We showcase selenadiazole motifs in supramolecular networks of varying primary chain length prepared through polymerization using tandem step&#8208;growth/Passerini multicomponent reactions (MCRs). Compared to controls lacking the selenadiazole motif, these networks display increased glass transition temperatures and moduli due to the chalcogen bonding linkages formed between chains. These elastomeric networks were shown to autonomously heal at room temperature, retaining up to 83&#8201;% of the ultimate tensile strength. Lastly, we use post&#8208;polymerization modification via the Biginelli MCR to add selenadiazole motifs to narrowly dispersed polymers for controlled topology in solution. Chalcogen squares via selenadiazoles introduce an exciting exchange mechanism to the realm of dynamic materials.

         <title>Changing Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with a Reversible Rotaxane Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The translocation of a macrocycle relative to a point chiral center on a rotaxane axle can amplify the macroscopic expression of the molecular chirality in a soft matter system. When the macrocycle binds to a chiral amino acid on the rotaxane axle in a nematic liquid crystal doped with 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the rotaxane, the liquid crystal helix contracts to approximately 68&#8201;% of the pitch length observed when the ring is distant from the chiral center.







Abstract
The transmission of chiral information between the molecular, meso and microscopic scales is a facet of biology that remains challenging to understand mechanistically and to mimic with artificial systems. Here we demonstrate that the dynamic change in the expression of the chirality of a rotaxane can be transduced into a change in pitch of a soft matter system. Shuttling the position of the macrocycle from far&#8208;away&#8208;from to close&#8208;to a point&#8208;chiral center on the rotaxane axle changes the expression of the chiral information that is transmitted across length scales; from nanometer scale constitutional chirality that affects the conformation of the macrocycle, to the centimeter scale chirality of the liquid crystal phase, significantly changing the pitch length of the chiral nematic structure.

         <title>Optimizing Intermediate Adsorption over PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) Bimetallene for Boosted Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a library of Pd&#8208;based bimetallene with various transition metal dopants (PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)) are screened to learn their structure&#8211;activity relationship towards NO3RR. The ultra&#8208;thin structure of metallene greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites, and the transition metals dopants play a key role in precisely tuning the electronic state and optimizing intermediates adsorption, thus facilitating nitrate reduction to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NO3RR) is a promising and eco&#8208;friendly strategy for ammonia production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the eight&#8208;electron transfer process and poor mechanistic understanding strongly impedes its application. To unveil the internal laws, herein, a library of Pd&#8208;based bimetallene with various transition metal dopants (PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)) are screened to learn their structure&#8211;activity relationship towards NO3RR. The ultra&#8208;thin structure of metallene greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites, and the transition metals dopants break the electronic balance and upshift its d&#8208;band center, thus optimizing intermediates adsorption. The anisotropic electronic characteristics of these transition metals make the NO3RR activity in the order of PdCu&gt;PdCo&#8776;PdFe&gt;PdNi&gt;Pd, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 295&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 along with Faradaic efficiency of 90.9&#8201;% is achieved in neutral electrolyte on PdCu bimetallene. Detailed studies further reveal that the moderate N&#8208;species (*NO3 and *NO2) adsorption ability, enhanced *NO activation, and reduced HER activity facilitate the NH3 production. We believe our results will give a systematic guidance to the future design of NO3RR catalysts.

         <title>A Tag&#8208;Free Platform for Synthesis and Screening of Cyclic Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS), macrocyclic peptide libraries traditionally necessitate decoding tags, essential for both library synthesis and identifying hit peptide sequences post&#8208;screening. Our innovation introduces a tag&#8208;free technology platform for synthesizing cyclic peptide libraries in solution and facilitates screening against biological targets to identify peptide binders through unconventional intramolecular CyClick and DeClick Chemistries (CCDC) discovered within our research. This combination allows for the synthesis of diverse cyclic peptide libraries, the incorporation of various amino acids, and facile linearization and decoding of cyclic peptide binder sequences. Our sensitivity&#8208;enhancing derivatization method, utilized in tandem with nano LC&#8208;MS/MS, enables the sequencing of peptides even at exceedingly low picomolar concentrations. Employing our technology platform, we've successfully unearthed novel cyclic peptide binders against a monoclonal antibody and the first cyclic peptide binder of HIV CAPSID protein responsible for viral infections as validated by microscale thermalshift assays (TSA), biolayer Interferometry (BLI) and functional assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Porous Aromatic Framework&#160;Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) show promising potential in anionic conduction due to their high stability and customizable functionality. However, the insolubility of most PAFs presents a significant challenge in their processing into membranes and subsequent applications. In this study, continuous PAF membranes with adjustable thickness were successfully created using liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization. The rigid backbone and the stable C&#8722;C coupling endow PAF membrane with superior chemical and dimensional stabilities over most conventional polymer membranes. Different quaternary ammonium functionalities were anchored to the backbone through flexible alkyl chains with tunable length. The optimal PAF membrane exhibited an OH&#8208;&#160;conductivity of 356.6 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity. Additionally, the PAF membrane exhibited outstanding alkaline stability, retaining 95% of its OH&#8722; conductivity after 1000 hours in 1M NaOH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of PAF materials in anion exchange membranes, achieving the highest OH&#8722; conductivity and exceptional chemical/dimensional stability. This work provides the possibility for the potential of PAF materials in anionic conductive membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Revision of a Widespread Marine Sulfonolipid Class Based on Isolation and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cosmopolitan marine Roseobacter clade is of global biogeochemical importance. Members of this clade produce sulfur&#8208;containing amino lipids (SALs) of importance for biofilm formation and marine surface colonization processes. Despite their physiological importance and abundance, SALs have only been explored through genomic mining approaches and lipidomic studies based on mass spectrometry, which left the relative and absolute structures of SALs unresolved hindering progress in biochemical and functional investigations. Here, we report the structural revision of a new group of SALs, which we named cysteinolides, using a combination of analytical techniques, isolation and degradation experiments and total synthetic efforts. Contrary to the previously proposed homotaurine&#8208;based structures, cysteinolides are composed of an N,O&#8208;acylated cysteinolic acid&#8208;containing head group carrying various different (&#945;&#8209;hydroxy) carboxylic acids. We performed the first validated targeted&#8208;network based analysis, which allowed us to map the distribution and structural diversity of cysteinolides across bacterial lineages. Beyond offering structural insights, our research provides SAL standards and validated analytical data. This information holds significance for forthcoming investigations into bacterial sulfonolipid metabolism and biogeochemical nutrient cycling within marine environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Dissipative Control of Multimodal Motion in a Silver(I) Catenate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stepwise dissipative control of two distinct motions, i.e., shuttling and sliding, is demonstrated in a single multicomponent device. When [2]rotaxane 1, which acts as a biped, and deck 2 were treated with AgBF4 / PhCH2Br + NEt3 as chemical fuel, the transient catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8226;[Ag3(2)]3+ was instantly generated showing multimodal motion and autonomous return to 1 and 2. In the dissipative process, catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8226;[Ag3(2)]3+ cleanly transformed into the follow&#8208;up transient device (1)&#8226;[Ag3(2)]3+ exhibiting only sliding motion. Two interference&#8208;free dissipative cycles proved the resilience and robustness of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Modified RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribonucleic acids&#160;play a vital role in living organisms. Many of their cellular functions depend critically on chemical modification. Methods to modify RNA in a controlled manner &#8211; both in vitro and in vivo &#8211; are thus essential to evaluate and understand RNA biology at the molecular and mechanistic levels. The diversity of modifications, combined with the size and uniformity of RNA (made up of only 4 nucleotides) makes its site&#8208;specific modification a challenging task that needs to be addressed by complementary approaches. One such approach is solid&#8208;phase RNA synthesis. We discuss recent developments in this field, starting with new protection concepts in the ongoing effort to overcome current size limitations. We continue with selected modifications that have posed significant challenges for their incorporation into RNA. These include deazapurine bases required for atomic mutagenesis to elucidate mechanistic aspects of catalytic RNAs, and RNA containing xanthosine, N4&#8208;acetylcytidine, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytidine, 3&#8208;methylcytidine, 2&#8217;&#8208;OCF3, and 2&#8217;&#8208;N3 ribose modifications. We also discuss the all&#8208;chemical synthesis of 5&#8217;&#8208;capped mRNAs and the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides to obtain long RNA with multiple distinct modifications, such as those needed for single&#8208;molecule FRET&#8208;studies. Finally, we highlight promising developments in RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modification using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functionalities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>First examples of diborane(6) dianions decorated with weakly coordination B(C6F5)3 (BCF) groups and SiEt3+ moieties have been synthesized demonstrating the synthetic potential of the [B2(CN)6]2&#8722; dianion. [B2{CNB(C6F5)3}6]2&#8211; (1) was isolated as potassium and tetrabutylammonium salt. 1 is a rare example for a weakly coordinating dianion and it was used for the stabilization of the carbo&#173;cation [Ph3C]+ and the oxonium acid [H(OEt2)2]+. Reaction of [Ph3C]21 with HSiEt3 resulted in the silylated neutral diborane(6) [B2{CNB(C6F5)3}4(CNSiEt3)2] (2) in which two BCF groups have been selectively replaced by SiEt3+ substituents, underlining the stability and chemical versatility of the [B2(CN)6]2&#8722; dianion. The chemical properties and physicochemical data of 1 and 2 provide insight into electronic, coordinating, and steric properties of theses novel diborane(6) compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the direct synthesis of new azulene derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reactions. A five&#8208;membered ring as backbone in the applied triene&#8208;yne substrates turned out to be crucial to induce the 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization mode necessary to trigger azulene formation. The obtained targets are of high interest due to their potential applications in different fields, like organic materials, medicine or cosmetics. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry were measured, based on these the electronic properties were determined . Short two or three step sequences towards the applied starting materials make this approach synthetically highly attractive.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and internal dynamics of short RNA duplexes determined by a combination of pulsed EPR methods and MD simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We used EPR spectroscopy to characterize the structure of RNA duplexes and their internal twist, stretch and bending motions. We prepared eight 20 base&#8208;pair long RNA duplexes containing the rigid spin&#8208;label &#199;m, a cytidine analogue, at two positions and acquired orientation&#8208;selective PELDOR/DEER data. By using different frequency bands (X&#8208;, Q&#8208;, G&#8208;band), detailed information about the distance and orientation of the labels was obtained and provided insights into the global conformational dynamics of the RNA duplex. We used 19F Mims ENDOR experiments on three singly &#199;m and singly fluorine labeled RNA duplexes to determine the exact position of the &#199;m spin label in the helix. In a quantitative comparison to MD simulations of RNA with and without &#199;m spin labels, we found that state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art force fields with explicit parameterization of the spin label were able to describe the conformational ensemble present in our experiments. The MD simulations further confirmed that the &#199;m spin labels are excellent mimics of cytidine inducing only small local changes in the RNA structure. &#199;m spin labels are thus ideally suited for high&#8208;precision EPR experiments to probe the structure and, in conjunction with MD simulations, motions of RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in a Porous Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photoresponsive systems with non&#8208;invasive orthogonal control by distinct wavelengths of light is still in its infancy. In particular, the design of photochemically triggered&#8208;orthogonal systems integrated into solid materials that enable multiple dynamic control over their properties remains a longstanding challenge. Here we report the orthogonal and reversible control of two types of photoswitches in an integrated solid porous framework, that is, visible&#8208;light responsive o&#8208;fluoroazobenzene and nitro&#8208;spiropyran motifs. The properties of the constructed material can be selectively controlled by different wavelengths of light thus generating four distinct states providing a basis for dynamic multifunctional materials. Solid state NMR demonstrated the selective transformation of the azobenzene switch in the bulk which in turn modulates N2 and CO2 adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Water in Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of Methanol Conversion for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water molecules, which act as both solvent and reactant, play critical roles in photocatalytic reactions for methanol conversion. However, the influence of water on the adsorption of methanol and desorption of liquid products, which are two essential steps that control the performance in photocatalysis, has been well under&#8208;explored. Herein, we reveal the role of water in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes of methanol conversion on the platinized carbon nitride (Pt/C3N4) model photocatalyst. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy techniques, isotope effects, and computational calculations demonstrate that water shows adverse effects on the adsorption of methanol molecules and desorption processes of methanol oxidation products on the surface of Pt/C3N4, significantly altering the reaction pathways in photocatalytic methanol conversion process. Guided by these discoveries, a photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system is designed to achieve a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 2.3%, which is among the highest values reported. This work highlights the important roles of solvents in controlling the adsorption/desorption behaviours of liquid&#8208;phase heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes Fabricated on Flexible Polymer Supports for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrathin continuous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes have the potential to achieve high gas permeance and selectivity simultaneously for otherwise difficult gas separations, but with few exceptions for zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) membranes, current methods cannot conveniently realize practical large&#8208;area fabrication. Here, we propose a ligand back diffusion&#8208;assisted bipolymer&#8208;directed metal ion distribution strategy for preparing large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes on flexible polymeric support layers. The bipolymer directs metal ions to form a cross&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network with a uniform distribution of metal ions on support layers. Ligand back diffusion controls the feed of ligand molecules available for nuclei formation, resulting in the continuous growth of large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes. We report the practical fabrication of three representative defect&#8208;free MOF membranes with areas larger than 2,400 cm2 and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8210;130 nm), including ZIFs and carboxylate&#8208;linker MOFs. Among these, the ZIF&#8208;8 membrane displays high gas permeance of 3,979 GPU for C3H6, with good mixed gas selectivity (43.88 for C3H6/C3H8). To illustrate its scale&#8208;up practicality, MOF membranes were prepared and incorporated into spiral&#8208;wound membrane modules with an active area of 4,800 cm2. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930 GPU for C3H6) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C3H6/C3H8).</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Mediated Polymerization Catalyzed by Carbon Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomediated polymerizations replace traditional methods due to cost&#8208;efficiency, sustainability, and temporal control. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, specifically carbon nanomaterials (dots and nitrides), bring many advantages. They&#8242;re derived inexpensively from biomass and highly efficient in various polymerization modes. This review covers their preparation, photocatalytic properties, and use in various polymerization methods. It also discusses their applications, and future prospects and challenges.







Abstract
Carbon nanomaterials, specifically carbon dots and carbon nitrides, play a crucial role as heterogeneous photoinitiators in both radical and cationic polymerization processes. These recently introduced materials offer promising solutions to the limitations of current homogeneous systems, presenting a novel approach to photopolymerization. This review highlights the preparation and photocatalytic performance of these nanomaterials, emphasizing their application in various polymerization techniques, including photoinduced i) free radical, ii) RAFT, iii) ATRP, and iv) cationic photopolymerization. Additionally, it discusses their potential in addressing contemporary challenges and explores prospects in this field. Moreover, carbon nitrides, in particular, exhibit exceptional oxygen tolerance, underscoring their significance in radical polymerization processes and allowing their applications such as 3D printing, surface modification of coatings, and hydrogel engineering.

         <title>&#8220;Off&#8208;Label Use&#8221; of the Siderophore Enterobactin Enables Targeted Imaging of Cancer with Radioactive Ti(IV)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional, cancer&#8208;targeting version of the siderophore enterobactin (Ent) was identified as an ideal carrier for the targeted delivery of radioactive titanium&#8208;45 to tumors in a mouse model of cancer. This is the first demonstration of targeted imaging with the Ti&#8208;45 isotope, opening new possibilities for nuclear imaging applications with radiometals.







Abstract
The development of inert, biocompatible chelation methods is required to harness the emerging positron emitting radionuclide 45Ti for radiopharmaceutical applications. Herein, we evaluate the Ti(IV)&#8208;coordination chemistry of four catechol&#8208;based, hexacoordinate chelators using synthetic, structural, computational, and radiochemical approaches. The siderophore enterobactin (Ent) and its synthetic mimic TREN&#8208;CAM readily form mononuclear Ti(IV) species in aqueous solution at neutral pH. Radiolabeling studies reveal that Ent and TREN&#8208;CAM form mononuclear complexes with the short&#8208;lived, positron&#8208;emitting radionuclide 45Ti(IV), and do not transchelate to plasma proteins in vitro and exhibit rapid renal clearance in na&#239;ve mice. These features guide efforts to target the 45Ti isotope to prostate cancer tissue through the design, synthesis, and evaluation of Ent&#8208;DUPA, a small molecule conjugate composed of a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting peptide and a monofunctionalized Ent scaffold. The [45Ti][Ti(Ent&#8208;DUPA)]2&#8722; complex forms readily at room temperature. In a tumor xenograft model in mice, selective tumor tissue accumulation (8&#177;5&#8201;%, n=5), and low off&#8208;target uptake in other organs is observed. Overall, this work demonstrates targeted imaging with 45Ti(IV), provides a foundation for advancing the application of 45Ti in nuclear medicine, and reveals that Ent can be repurposed as a 45Ti&#8208;complexing cargo for targeted nuclear imaging applications.

         <title>Enhanced Detection of Novel Low&#8208;Frequency Gene Fusions via High&#8208;Yield Ligation and Multiplexed Enrichment Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of double&#8208;strand stem in adapter imposes effect on ligation strategy and reaction equilibrium. We conducted a pioneering investigation into the stability of double&#8208;stranded adapter DNA and cascaded it with blocker displacement amplification technology, enabling improved ligation yield with enhanced conversion efficiency and selective enrichment in mutations with low variant allele frequency.







Abstract
Panel&#8208;based methods are commonly employed for the analysis of novel gene fusions in precision diagnostics and new drug development in cancer. However, these methods are constrained by limitations in ligation yield and the enrichment of novel gene fusions with low variant allele frequencies. In this study, we conducted a pioneering investigation into the stability of double&#8208;stranded adapter DNA, resulting in improved ligation yield and enhanced conversion efficiency. Additionally, we implemented blocker displacement amplification, achieving a remarkable 7&#8208;fold enrichment of novel gene fusions. Leveraging the pre&#8208;enrichment achieved with this approach, we successfully applied it to Nanopore sequencing, enabling ultra&#8208;fast analysis of novel gene fusions within one hour with high sensitivity. This method offers a robust and remarkably sensitive mean of analyzing novel gene fusions, promising the discovery of pivotal biomarkers that can significantly improve cancer diagnostics and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

         <title>The Synthesis and Reactivity of Naphthoquinonynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first systematic exploration of the synthesis and reactivity of naphthoquinonynes is described. Routes to two regioisomeric Kobayashi&#8208;type naphthoquinonyne precursors have been developed, and the reactivity of the ensuing aryne intermediates has been investigated. A broad range of cycloadditions, nucleophile additions and difunctionalizations can be achieved while maintaining the integrity of the highly sensitive quinone unit.







Abstract
The first systematic exploration of the synthesis and reactivity of naphthoquinonynes is described. Routes to two regioisomeric Kobayashi&#8208;type naphthoquinonyne precursors have been developed, and the reactivity of the ensuing 6,7&#8208; and 5,6&#8208;aryne intermediates has been investigated. Remarkably, these studies have revealed that a broad range of cycloadditions, nucleophile additions and difunctionalizations can be achieved while maintaining the integrity of the highly sensitive quinone unit. The methodologies offer a powerful diversity oriented approach to C6 and C7 functionalized naphthoquinones, which are typically challenging to access. From a reactivity viewpoint, the study is significant because it demonstrates that aryne&#8208;based functionalizations can be utilized strategically in the presence of highly reactive and directly competing functionality.

         <title>Rechargeable Afterglow Nanotorches for In Vivo Tracing of Cell&#8208;Based Microrobots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) rechargeable nanotorch was devised for in vivo tracking of cell&#8208;based microrobots (MRs). The as&#8208;prepared nanotorch uses faPT, a methylene blue analog, as a NIR transducer, generating singlet oxygen that prompts the SA570, a modified version of Schaap's 1,2&#8208;dioxetane, to produce a 10&#8208;day&#8208;lasting afterglow. Once its glow fades, the nanotorch can be non&#8208;invasively recharged using 660&#8197;nm light, highlighting its potential for continuous in vivo MR tracking.







Abstract
As one of the self&#8208;luminescence imaging approaches that require pre&#8208;illumination instead of real&#8208;time light excitation, afterglow luminescence imaging has attracted increasing enthusiasm to circumvent tissue autofluorescence. In this work, we developed organic afterglow luminescent nanoprobe (nanotorch), which could emit persistent luminescence more than 10&#8197;days upon single light excitation. More importantly, the nanotorch could be remote charged by 660&#8197;nm light in a non&#8208;invasive manner, which showed great potential for real&#8208;time tracing the location of macrophage cell&#8208;based microrobots.

         <title>Cyclopropenimine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Activation for the Synthesis of Polyurethanes and Small&#8208;Molecule Carbonates and Carbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropenimine, polyurethane, carbon dioxide, carbamates, organocatalysisCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Organo&#8208;carbonation (OrCa) polymerization employs the superbase cyclopropenimine to bind CO2 and mediate its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. Cyclopropenimine is recyclable and this procedure provides direct access to N&#8208;alkylated polyurethanes.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Given the adverse impact of CO2 on the atmosphere, it is of paramount importance to devise strategies for upcycling it into useful materials, such as polymers and fine chemicals. To activate such stable molecule, superbases offer viable modes of binding to CO2. In this study, a superbase cyclopropenimine derivative was found to exhibit exceptional proficiency in activating CO2 and mediating its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. The versatility of this reaction can be extended to monofunctional amines and alcohols, yielding a variety of functional carbonates and carbamates.

         <title>Transpassive Metal Dissolution vs. Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Implication for Alloy Stability and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) have sparked significant interest for their corrosion and electrocatalytic stability. Investigating the CrCoNi alloy revealed substantial metal dissolution during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) without typical corrosion indicators. This finding impacts MPEA stability understanding, emphasizing the need of precise OER catalyst efficiency measurements through metal ion quantification.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) are gaining interest in corrosion and electrocatalysis research due to their electrochemical stability across a broad pH range and the design flexibility they offer. Using the equimolar CrCoNi alloy, we observe significant metal dissolution in a corrosive electrolyte (0.1&#8197;M NaCl, pH&#8197;2) concurrently with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the transpassive region, despite the absence of hysteresis in polarization curves or other obvious corrosion indicators. We present a characterization scheme to delineate the contribution of OER and alloy dissolution, using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for OER&#8208;onset detection, and quantitative chemical analysis with inductively coupled&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and ultraviolet visible light (UV/Vis) spectrometry to elucidate metal dissolution processes. In situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM) revealed that the transpassive metal dissolution on CrCoNi is dominated by intergranular corrosion. These results have significant implications for the stability of MPEAs in corrosion systems, emphasizing the necessity of analytically determining metal ions released from MPEA electrodes into the electrolyte when evaluating Faradaic efficiencies of OER catalysts. The release of transition metal ions not only reduces the Faradaic efficiency of electrolyzers but may also cause poisoning and degradation of membranes in electrochemical reactors.

         <title>Molecular Twist&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Crystal Isomerization and Valence Tautomeric Transitions in a Cobalt&#8208;Dioxolene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;activated molecular twist&#8208;induced unconventional trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis structural transformation is realized in the solid state, and consequent one&#8208;step&#8208;to&#8208;two&#8208;step transitions of valence tautomeric behaviors are observed.







Abstract
A mononuclear valence tautomeric (VT) complex, [Co(pycz)2(Sq)(Cat)] (1&#8208;trans), where pycz = 9&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, Sq&#8901;&#8722; = 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;semiquinonato, and Cat2&#8722; = 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;catecholato, is synthesized in the trans configuration, which undergoes one&#8208;step valence tautomeric transition above room temperature. Remarkably, 1&#8208;trans can transform into its isomeric structure, [Co(pycz)2(Sq)(Sq)] (1&#8208;cis), at temperature above 350&#8197;K in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal way by in situ molecular twist, and the resulting 1&#8208;cis exhibits a pronounced two&#8208;step VT transition during magnetic measurements that is rare for mononuclear VT complexes. Such drastic solid&#8208;state structural transformation is reported in VT compounds for the first time, which is actuated by a crystal surface's melting&#8208;recrystallization induced phase transition process. DFT calculations offer an underlying mechanism suggesting a concerted bond rotation during the structural transformation. The results demonstrate an unconventional approach that realizes structural transformation of VT complexes and the control of VT performance.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Heck Coupling and Allylboration of Iododiboron Compounds via Diboryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ambiphilic reactivity of iododiboron compounds was disclosed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reactions of iododiborons, alkenes and aldehydes/imines. The reaction features mild conditions, broad scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and functional group tolerance. An unconventional Pd(0/I/II) catalytic cycle is operative, supported by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Geminal bis(boronates) are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. The fact that they predominantly serve as nucleophiles in the previous reports, however, has restrained their synthetic potential. Herein we disclose the ambiphilic reactivity of &#945;&#8208;halogenated geminal bis(boronates), of which the first catalytic utilization was accomplished by merging a formal Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a highly diastereoselective allylboration of aldehydes or imines, providing a new avenue for rapid assembly of polyfunctionalized boron&#8208;containing compounds. We demonstrated that this cascade reaction is highly efficient and compatible with various functional groups, and a wide range of heterocycles. In contrast to a classical Pd(0/II) scenario, mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations have provided strong evidence for a catalytic cycle involving Pd(I)/diboryl carbon radical intermediates.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Tricoordinate Organoberyllium Azides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first two examples of molecular tricoordinate organoberyllium azides were synthesized via salt metathesis as well as radical recombination. First reactivity studies on these compounds reveal extensive ligand scrambling, the formation of a unique &#947;&#8208;azide borole adduct, as well as the potential to generate highly reactive beryllium nitrene intermediates.







Abstract
A series of terminal mono&#8208; and disubstituted beryllium azides of the form [(CAAC)Be(N3)R] (R=CAACH, Dur; CAACH/CAAC=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl/idene, Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) and [L2Be(N3)2] (L=CAACNH=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imine, IiPrMe=1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), respectively, were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Thermolysis and photolysis products of these first examples of tricoordinate azidoberyllium complexes evidence extensive ligand scrambling and the formal insertion of nitrenes into the CAAC&#8722;Be bond, generating cyclic alkyl(amino)imine (CAAI) ligands. Furthermore, the reaction with a small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) leads to unexpected CAAC&#8208;NHC ligand exchange, while the reaction with pentaphenylborole yields the first &#947;&#8208;azide adduct of a borole, long postulated to be the first step in the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines from boroles and azides.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Integration of Phosphor, Initiator, and Crosslinker for the Photo&#8208;Polymerization of Flexible Phosphorescent Polymer Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional phosphorescence molecule, benzothiadiazole&#8208;based dialkene (BTD&#8208;HEA), has been developed, serving as both photo&#8208;initiator and crosslinker. It facilitates the rapid polymerization of various acrylate&#8208;based monomers into flexible phosphorescent gels within 120&#8197;s, while enabling real&#8208;time in situ monitoring. The versatility of BTD&#8208;HEA underscores its potential applications in the fields of bioimaging and wearable optoelectronics.







Abstract
A general approach to constructing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials involves the incorporation of a phosphorescent emitter into a rigid host or polymers with high glass transition temperature. However, these materials often suffer from poor processability and suboptimal mechanical properties, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we developed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based dialkene (BTD&#8208;HEA), a multifunctional phosphorescent emitter with a remarkable yield of intersystem crossing (&#934;ISC, 99.83&#8201;%). Its high triplet exciton generation ability and dialkene structure enable BTD&#8208;HEA to act as a photoinitiator and crosslinker, efficiently initiating the polymerization of various monomers within 120&#8197;seconds. A range of flexible phosphorescence gels, including hydrogels, organogels, ionogels, and aerogels were fabricated, which exhibit outstanding stretchability and recoverability. Furthermore, the unique fluorescent&#8208;phosphorescent colorimetric properties of the gels provide a more sensitive method for the visual determination of the polymerization process. Notably, the phosphorescent emission intensity of the hydrogel can be increased by the formation of ice, allowing for the precise detection of hydrogel freezing. The versatility of this emitter paves the way for fabricating various flexible phosphorescence gels with diverse morphologies using microfluidics, film&#8208;shearing, roll coating process, and two/three&#8208;dimensional printing, showcasing its potential applications in the fields of bioimaging and bioengineering.

         <title>Dynamic Entwined Topology in Helical Covalent Polymers Dictated by Competing Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies have uncovered a metal&#8208;coordinated helical covalent polymer (m&#8208;HCP), where the polymer chains intertwine through metal coordination bonds. The reticulation of this entwining topology is illustrated through the incorporation of sodium and potassium ions. Furthermore, ion exchange can lead to a hydrogen&#8208;bonded HCP undergoing conversion into the m&#8208;HCP structure.







Abstract
Naturally occurring polymeric structures often consist of 1D polymer chains intricately folded and entwined through non&#8208;covalent bonds, adopting precise topologies crucial for their functionality. The exploration of crystalline 1D polymers through dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) and supramolecular interactions represents a novel approach for developing crystalline polymers. This study shows that sub&#8208;angstrom differences in the counter&#8208;ion size can lead to various helical covalent polymer (HCP) topologies, including a novel metal&#8208;coordination HCP (m&#8208;HCP) motif. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis of HCP&#8722;Na revealed that double helical pairs are formed by sodium ions coordinating to spiroborate linkages to form rectangular pores. The double helices are interpenetrated by the unreacted diols coordinating sodium ions. The reticulation of the m&#8208;HCP structure was demonstrated by the successful synthesis of HCP&#8722;K. Finally, ion&#8208;exchange studies were conducted to show the interconversion between HCP structures. This research illustrates how seemingly simple modifications, such as changes in counter&#8208;ion size, can significantly influence the polymer topology and determine which supramolecular interactions dominate the crystal lattice.

         <title>Electrochemical Capacitance Traces with Interlayer Spacing in Two&#8208;dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Faradaic contributions to charge storage increase as interlayer spacing widens in a series of Ni3(HIR3&#8208;TAT)2 (R=H, Et, n&#8208;Bu, n&#8208;Pent) 2D conductive MOFs, as the charge storage mechanism shifts to adopt increasingly pseudocapacitive character. An optimum in terms of capacitance is reached, balancing faradaic contributions and resistances.







Abstract
Electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for electrochemical capacitors (EC) for fast energy storage due to their high specific surface areas and potential for redox activity. To maximize energy density, traditional inorganic pseudocapacitors have utilized faradaic processes in addition to double&#8208;layer capacitance. Although conductive MOFs are usually comprised of redox active ligands which allow faradaic reactions upon electrochemical polarization, systematic studies providing deeper understanding of the charge storage processes and structure&#8208;function relationships have been scarce. Here, we investigate the charge storage mechanisms of a series of triazatruxene&#8208;based 2D layered conductive MOFs with variable alkyl functional groups, Ni3(HIR3&#8208;TAT)2 (TAT=triazatruxene; R=H, Et, n&#8208;Bu, n&#8208;Pent). Functionalization of the triazatruxene core allows for systematic variation of structural parameters while maintaining in&#8208;plane conjugation between ligands and metals. Specifically, R groups modulate interlayer spacing, which in turn shifts the charge storage mechanism from double&#8208;layer capacitance towards pseudocapacitance, leading to an increase in molar specific capacitance from Ni3(HIH3&#8208;TAT)2 to Ni3(HIBu3&#8208;TAT)2. Partial exfoliation of Ni3(HIBu3&#8208;TAT)2 renders redox active ligand moieties more accessible, and thus increases the dominance of faradaic processes. Our strategy of controlling charge storage mechanism through tuning the accessibility of redox&#8208;active sites may motivate further design and engineering of electrode materials for EC.

A case study on different decomposition channels of a backbone saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene in the coordination sphere of alanes is reported.

The reaction of the amine&#8208;stabilized alane (NMe3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 1 with the backbone&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) SIDipp (SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;{2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;phenyl}&#8208;imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) at 0&#8201;&#176;C yielded the NHC alane adduct (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2. Reaction at elevated temperatures or prolonged reaction at room temperature gave the product of a ring expansion reaction (RER) of the NHC, (NMe3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH(RER&#8208;SIDippH2) 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NMe3). Subsequent reaction of the latter with sterically less hindered NHCs (IMeMe {=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, IiPrMe {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, and IiPr {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}) afforded the NHC&#8208;stabilized RER&#8208;products (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH(RER&#8208;SIDippH2) 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NHC) (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe, IiPr), while no reaction was observed with the sterically more demanding NHCs IDipp (=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;{2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;phenyl}&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), SIDipp and ItBu (=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The compounds 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NHC) were also obtained starting from (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2 and NHC at room temperature. Heating solutions of (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2 without additional base to 95&#8201;&#176;C resulted in decarbonization of the NHC and substitution of the carbene carbon atom with aluminum hydride under loss of ethene. Subsequent dimerization afforded cis&#8208;[AlH{&#956;&#8208;N(Dipp)CH2CH2N(Dipp)}]2 4_dimer. Heating solutions of the NHC&#8208;ligated aluminum alkyls (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlR3 2R (R=Me, Et) to 145&#8201;&#176;C instead led to complete scission of the NHC backbone with evolution of ethene and isolation of the dialkylaluminium(III) amidinates {DippNC(R)NDipp}AlR2 5R (R=Me, Et).

         <title>Tailoring Second Coordination Sphere for Tunable Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Charge Transfer toward Enhanced Photoelectrochemical H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8211;liquid interfacial charge transfer dynamics of p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated by designing the metal centers and first/second coordination spheres of molecular catalysts in the electrolyte. The p&#8208;Si/Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 photocathode system exhibits efficient and durable photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.







Abstract
The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely limits the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by optimizing the charge transfer dynamics at the solid&#8211;liquid interface via molecular catalyst design. Specifically, the surface of a p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated using molecular catalysts with different metal atoms and organic ligands to improve H2 production performance. Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 is identified as an efficient and durable catalyst for H2 production through the rational design of metal centers and first/second coordination spheres. The modulation with Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2, which contains an electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8722;SO3H group in the second coordination sphere, elevates the flat&#8208;band potential of the polished p&#8208;Si photocathode and nanoporous p&#8208;Si photocathode by 81&#8197;mV and 124&#8197;mV, respectively, leading to the maximized energy band bending and the minimized interfacial carrier transport resistance. Consequently, both the two photocathodes achieve the Faradaic efficiency of more than 95&#8201;% for H2 production, which is well maintained during 18&#8197;h and 21&#8197;h reaction, respectively. This work highlights that the band&#8208;edge engineering by molecular catalysts could be an important design consideration for semiconductor&#8211;catalyst hybrids toward PEC H2 production.

         <title>Spontaneous Curvature Induction in an Artificial Bilayer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous curvature induction in an artificial supramolecular bilayer membrane and its transformation into vesicles in pure water is demonstrated. Compositional asymmetry resulting from the autogenous protonation of amines led to the formation of an asymmetric membrane and curvature induction. The stability provided by the hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of the supramolecular structure in water appears to be critical in the dynamic morphological transformations.







Abstract
Maintaining lipid asymmetry across membrane leaflets is critical for functions like vesicular traffic and organelle homeostasis. However, a lack of molecular&#8208;level understanding of the mechanisms underlying membrane fission and fusion processes in synthetic systems precludes their development as artificial analogs. Here, we report asymmetry induction of a bilayer membrane formed by an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with oxyalkylene side chains bearing terminal tertiary amine moieties (BA1) in water. Autogenous protonation of the tertiary amines in the periphery of the bilayer by water induces anisotropic curvature, resulting in membrane fission to form vesicles and can be monitored using time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy and microscopy. Interestingly, upon loss of the induced asymmetry by extensive protonation using an organic acid restored bilayer membrane. The mechanism leading to the compositional asymmetry in the leaflet and curvature induction in the membrane is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Studies extended to control molecules having changes in hydrophilic (BA2) and hydrophobic (BA3) segments provide insight into the delicate nature of molecular scale interactions in the dynamic transformation of supramolecular structures. The synergic effect of hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of BA1 aggregates provide dynamicity and unusual stability. Our study unveils mechanistic insight into the dynamic transformation of bilayer membranes into vesicles.

         <title>Regulated Dual Defects of Bridging Organic and Terminal Inorganic Ligands in Iron&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nodes for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulated dual defects of bridging organic ligands and terminal ligands of hydroxyls (OH&#8722;) and H2O induce the formation of exposed coordinatively unsaturated Fe centers as active sites in a Fe&#8208;based MOF catalyst, resulting in the efficient activation of inert N2 molecules and thus the enhanced photocatalytic NH3 production.







Abstract
Engineering advantageous defects to construct well&#8208;defined active sites in catalysts is promising but challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O due to the chemical inertness of N2 molecule. Here, we report defective Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalysts via a non&#8208;thermal plasma&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy, where their NH3 production capability is synergistically regulated by two types of defects, namely, bridging organic ligands and terminal inorganic ligands (OH&#8722; and H2O). Specially, the optimized MIL&#8208;100(Fe) catalysts, where there are only terminal inorganic ligand defects and coexistence of dual defects, exhibit the respective 1.7&#8208; and 7.7&#8208;fold activity enhancement comparable to the pristine catalyst under visible light irradiation. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the dual defects in the catalyst induce the formation of abundant and highly accessible coordinatively unsaturated Fe active sites and synergistically optimize their geometric and electronic structures, which favors the injection of more d&#8208;orbital electrons in Fe sites into the N2 &#960;* antibonding orbital to achieve N2 activation and the formation of a key intermediate *NNH in the reaction. This work provides a guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of porous catalysts with precise defective structures for high&#8208;performance activation of catalytic molecules.

         <title>Back Cover: Robust, Ultrafast and Reversible Photoswitching in Bulk Polymers Enabled by Octupolar Molecule Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octupolar design paradigm is proposed to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, i.e., multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse adducts (MOPSAs), as reported by Dingshan Yu, Xudong Chen, Quan Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402349). Such unique design exploits multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to overcome traditional solid&#8208;state photochromism limitations and attain robust ultrafast bidirectional photochromism in bulk polymers for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Atropisomeric Carboxylic Acids Synthesis via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation of Aza&#8208;biaryl Triflates with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading CO2 to value&#8208;added chiral molecules via catalytic asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation is a highly important yet challenging task. Although great progress on the formation of centrally chiral carboxylic acids has been achieved, catalytic construction of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2 has never been reported to date. Herein, we report the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2, which is enabled by nickel&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive carboxylation of racemic aza&#8208;biaryl triflates. A variety of important axially chiral carboxylic acids, which are valuable but difficult to obtain via catalysis, are generated in an enantioconvergent version. This new methodology features good functional group tolerance, easy to scale&#8208;up, facile transformation and avoids cumbersome steps, handling sensitive organometallic reagents and using stoichiometric chiral materials. Mechanistic investigations indicate a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process induced by chiral nickel catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Macroscopic Superlattice Membranes Self&#8208;assembled from Gold Nanobipyramids with Precisely Tunable Tip Arrangements for SERS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A persistent challenge in utilizing Au nanocrystals for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) lies in achieving controllable superstructures that maximize SERS performance. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to enhance the SERS performance by precisely adjusting the tip arrangements of Au nanobipyramids (BPs) in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices (SLs). This is achieved through ligand&#8208;exchange of Au BPs, followed by liquid&#8208;air interfacial assembly, resulting in large&#8208;area, transferrable SL membranes. The key to controlling the arrangement of Au BPs in the SLs is the regulation of the amount of free ligands added during self&#8208;assembly, which allows for the precise formation of various configurations such as tilted SLs, tip&#8208;on&#8208;tip SLs, and tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip SLs. Among these configurations, tip&#8208;on&#8208;tip SLs exhibit the highest enhancement factor for SERS, reaching an impressive value of 1.95 &#215; 108, with uniform and consistent SERS signals across a large area. The experimental findings are further corroborated by simulations using the finite element method. This study establishes an efficient method for engineering the microstructure of 2D SLs composed of Au BPs, highlighting the importance of fine&#8208;tuning the tip arrangements of Au BPs to regulate SERS performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Polyimide Tunneling Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), challenges remain in terms of finding effective and viable strategies to enhance their long&#8208;term stability while maintaining high efficiency. In this study, a new insulating and hydrophobic fluorinated polyimide (FPI: 6FDA&#8208;6FAPB) was used as the interface layer between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) in PSCs. The functional groups of FPI play a pivotal role in passivating interface defects within the device. Due to its high work function, FPI demonstrates field&#8208;effect passivation (FEP) capabilities as an interface layer, effectively mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface. Notably, the FPI insulating interface layer does not impede carrier transmission at the interface, which is attributed to the presence of hole tunneling effects. The optimized PSCs achieve an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.61% and demonstrate excellent stability, showcasing the efficacy of FPI in enhancing device performance and reliability.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Efficient Dark Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with Ultra&#8208;Wide Range Tunable&#8208;Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tunable&#8208;lifetime room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been widely studied due to their broad applications. However, only few reports have achieved wide&#8208;range lifetime modulation. In this work, ultra&#8208;wide range tunable&#8208;lifetime efficient dark blue RTP materials were realized by doping methyl benzoate derivatives into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. The phosphorescence lifetimes of the doped film can be increased from 32.8 ms to 1925.8 ms. Such wide range of phosphorescence lifetime modulation is extremely rare in current reports. Moreover, the phosphorescence emission of the methyl 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate&#8208;doped film is located in the dark blue region and the phosphorescence quantum yield reaches as high as 15.4%, which broadens their applications in organic optoelectronic information. Further studies demonstrated that the reason for the tunable lifetime was that the magnitude of the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group modulates the HOMO&#8208;LUMO and singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of methyl benzoate derivatives, as well as the ability to non&#8208;covalent interactions with PVA. Moreover, the potential applications of luminescent displays and optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these high&#8208;performance dark blue RTP materials have been conducted.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Total Synthesis of Cephalotaxus Diterpenoids and Their Structural Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present a unified chemical synthesis of three subgroups of cephalotaxus diterpenoids for the first time. Key to the success lies in adopting a synthetic strategy that is inspired by biosynthesis but is opposite in nature. By employing selective one&#8208;carbon introduction and ring expansion operations, we have successfully converted cephalotane&#8208;type C18 dinorditerpenoids (using cephanolide B as a starting material) into troponoid&#8208;type C19 norditerpenoids and intact cephalotane&#8208;type C20 diterpenoids. This synthetic approach has enabled us to synthesize cephinoid H, 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;cephinoid H, 7&#8208;oxo&#8208;cephinoid H, fortalpinoid C, 7&#8208;epi&#8208;fortalpinoid C, cephanolide E, and 13&#8208;epi&#8208;cephanolide E. Furthermore, through the development of an intermolecular asymmetric Michael reaction between &#946;&#8208;oxo esters and &#946;&#8208;substituted enones, we have achieved the enantioselective synthesis of advanced intermediates within our synthetic sequence, thus formally realizing the asymmetric total synthesis of the cephalotaxus diterpenoids family.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a unified chemical synthesis of three subgroups of cephalotaxus diterpenoids for the first time. Key to the success lies in adopting a synthetic strategy that is inspired by biosynthesis but is opposite in nature. By employing selective one-carbon introduction and ring expansion operations, we have successfully converted cephalotane-type C18 dinorditerpenoids (using cephanolide B as a starting material) into troponoid-type C19 norditerpenoids and intact cephalotane-type C20 diterpenoids. This synthetic approach has enabled us to synthesize cephinoid H, 13-oxo-cephinoid H, 7-oxo-cephinoid H, fortalpinoid C, 7-epi-fortalpinoid C, cephanolide E, and 13-epi-cephanolide E. Furthermore, through the development of an intermolecular asymmetric Michael reaction between &#946;-oxo esters and &#946;-substituted enones, we have achieved the enantioselective synthesis of advanced intermediates within our synthetic sequence, thus formally realizing the asymmetric total synthesis of the cephalotaxus diterpenoids family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Catalyses Oxidative Coupling Formation of Insecticidal Dimeric Indole Piperazine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)&#8208;catalysed oxidative coupling is an efficient strategy of using simple building blocks to construct complex structural scaffolds of natural products. Among them, heterodimeric coupling between two different monomers is relatively scarce and the corresponding CYP450s are largely undiscovered. Herein, we discovered a fungal CYP450 (CpsD) and its associated cps cluster from 37208 CYP450s of Pfam PF00067 family member database and subsequently identified a group of new skeleton indole piperazine alkaloids (campesines A&#8208;G) by combination of genome mining and heterologous synthesis. Importantly, CYP450 CpsD mainly catalyses intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to generate unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight&#8208;ring scaffold via one C&#8208;C bond and two C&#8208;N bonds formation, illuminating its first dimerase role in this family natural products. The proposed catalytic mechanism of CpsD was deeply investigated via diversified substrate derivatization. Moreover, dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the global honeybee pest Galleria mellonella. Our work shows a representative example of discovering new skeleton monomeric and dimeric indole piperazine alkaloids from microbial resources, expands our knowledge of bond formation art of CYP450s and supports further development of the newly discovered and engineered campesine family compounds as potential biopesticides.</dc:description>

         <title>ATP&#8208;Independent Turnover of Dinitrogen Intermediates Captured on the Nitrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenase reduces N2 to NH3 at its active&#8208;site cofactor. Previous studies of an N2&#8208;bound Mo&#8208;nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii suggest binding of three N2 species via asymmetric belt&#8208;sulfur displacements in the two cofactors of its catalytic component (designated Av1*), leading to the proposal of stepwise N2 reduction involving all cofactor belt&#8208;sulfur sites; yet, the evidence for the existence of multiple N2 species on Av1* remains elusive. Here we report a study of ATP&#8208;independent, EuII/SO32&#8208; driven turnover of Av1* using GC&#8208;MS and frequency&#8208;selective pulse NMR techniques. Our data demonstrate incorporation of D2&#8208;derived D by Av1* into the products of C2H2&#8208; and H+&#8208;reduction, and decreased formation of NH3 by Av1* concomitant with release of N2 under H2; moreover, they reveal a strict dependence of these activities on SO32&#8208;. These observations point to the presence of distinct N2 species on Av1*, thereby providing strong support for our proposed mechanism of stepwise reduction of N2 via belt&#8208;sulfur mobilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Green&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with Approaching 20% Efficiency and Improved Photostability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) processed from non&#8208;halogenated solvents is crucially important for their scale&#8208;up industry production. However, owing to the difficulty of regulating molecular aggregation, there is a huge efficiency gap between non&#8208;halogenated and halogenated solvent processed OSCs. Herein, we fabricate o&#8208;xylene processed OSCs with approaching 20% efficiency by incorporating of a trimeric guest acceptor named Tri&#8208;V into the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X host blend. The incorporation of Tri&#8208;V effectively restricts the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X, and optimizes the phase&#8208;separation morphology, which leads to mitigated trap density states, reduced energy loss and suppressed charge recombination. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X:Tri&#8208;V&#8208;based device achieves an efficiency of 19.82%, representing the highest efficiency for green&#8208;solvent processed OSCs reported to date. Noticeably, with the addition of Tri&#8208;V, the ternary device shows an improved photostability than binary PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X&#8208;based device, and maintains 80% of the initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 1380 h. This work provides a feasible approach for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency, stable, eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, and sheds new light on the large&#8208;scale industrial production of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot deracemization method using  a bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) is proposed for the first time to convert a racemate to the desired enantiomer. Specifically, chiral &#945;, (&#945;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinemethanol) formed enantiospecific cocrystals with racemic dihydromyricetin, and used its own alkaline catalysis to catalyze the racemization between the (2R,3R)&#8208;enantiomer and (2S,3S)&#8208;enantiomer in solution, achieving a one&#8208;pot spontaneous deracemization. &#160;This strategy was also successfully extended to the deracemization of three other racemic compound drugs: (R,S)&#8208;carprofen, (R,S)&#8208;indoprofen, and (R,S)&#8208;indobufen.The one&#8208;pot deracemization method based on the BCA strategy provides a feasible approach to address the incompatibility between cocrystallization and racemization reactions that are commonly encountered in the cocrystallization&#8208;induced deracemization process and opens a new window to develop essential enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical products with atom economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Multipolar Conjugated Polymer Framework Derived Ionic Sieves via Electronic Modulation for Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we build a tunable multipolar conjugated polymer framework platform via pore wall chemistry to probe the role of electronic structure engineering in improving the Li+ conduction by theoretical studies. Guided by theoretical prediction, we develop a new  cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked multipolar polymer framework namely CNF&#8208;COF, acting as efficient ion sieves to modify polymer electrolytes for long&#8208;lifespan all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li metal batteries. The cyano and fluorine groups dual&#8208;decoration in CNF&#8208;COF favorably regulates the electronic structure via multipolar donor&#8208;acceptor electronic effects to afford proper energy band structure and abundant electron&#8208;rich sites for enhanced anti&#8208;oxidative ability, facilitated ion&#8208;pair dissociation and suppressed anion movements. Thus, the CNF&#8208;COF incorporation into poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes not only renders selective rapid Li+ conduction but also facilitates the Li dendrite suppression. Specifically, the constructed composite electrolyte with an ultralow CNF&#8208;COF content of only 0.5 wt% is endowed with a high ionic conductivity of  0.634 mS cm&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C  and a large  Li+  transference number of 0.81. As such,  the  Li  symmetric cell  delivers stable Li plating/stripping over  1400 h.  Impressively, t he assembled  ASS Li battery under  60 &#176;C  allows for stable  cycling  over 2000 cycles  at 1 C and over 1000 cycles even at 2 C.</dc:description>

Strong electron&#8208;acceptors with low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are a crucial unit for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs) with the NIR&#8208;II emission property, however, limited kinds of molecular skeletons are still available. Herein, D&#8211;A CPs involving fluorinated boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes (BAz) with enhanced electron&#8208;accepting properties are reported. Combination of fluorination at the azobenzene ligand and trifluoromethylation at the boron can effectively lower the LUMO energy level down to &#8722;4.42 eV, which is much lower than those of conventional strong electron&#8208;acceptors. The synthesized series of CPs showed excellent absorption/fluorescence property in solution over a wide NIR range including NIR&#8208;II. Furthermore, owing to the inherent solid&#8208;state emissive property of the BAz skeleton, obvious NIR&#8208;II fluorescence from the film (up to &#955;FL = 1213 nm) and the nanoparticle in water (&#955;FL = 1036 nm, brightness = up to 29 cm&#8211;1 M&#8211;1) were observed, proposing that our materials are applicable for developing next&#8208;generation of NIR&#8208;II luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards&#160;More&#160;Sustainable&#160;Aqueous&#160;Zinc&#8208;Ion&#160;Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as the promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their high safety, low cost and environmental benignity. The large&#8208;scale applications of AZIBs will inevitably result in a large amount of spent AZIBs, which not only induce the waste of resources, but also pose environmental risks. Therefore, sustainable AZIBs have to be considered to minimize the risk of environmental pollution and maximize the utilization of spent compounds. Herein, this minireview focus on the sustainability of AZIBs from material design and recycling techniques. The structure and degradation mechanism of AZIBs are discussed to guide the recycling design of the materials. Subsequently, the sustainability of component materials in AZIBs is further analysed to pre&#8208;evaluate their recycling behaviors and mentor the selection of more sustainable component materials, including active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes, and aqueous electrolytes, respectively. According to the features of component materials, corresponding green and economic approaches are further proposed to realize the recycling of active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes and electrolytes, respectively. These advanced technologies endow the recycling of component materials with high efficiency and a closed&#8208;loop&#160;control, ensuring that AZIBs will be the promising candidates of sustainable energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Liquid Crystal&#8208;Templated Chiral Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endowing perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) offers great promise for innovative chiroptical applications, but the existing strategies are inefficient in acquiring stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible chiral perovskite films with large, tunable dissymmetry factor (glum) and long&#8208;term stability. Here, we report a strategy for the design and synthesis of luminescent cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (Lumin&#8208;CLCE) films with mechanically tunable CPL, which is enabled by liquid crystal&#8208;templated chiral self&#8208;assembly and in situ covalent cross&#8208;linking of judiciously designed photopolymerizable CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PQD nanomonomers into the elastic polymer networks. The resulting Lumin&#8208;CLCE films showcase circularly polarized structural color in natural light and noticeable CPL with a maximum glum value up to 1.5 under UV light. The manipulation of CPL intensity and rotation direction is achieved by controlling the self&#8208;assembled helicoidal nanostructure and the handedness of soft helices. A significant breakthrough lies in the achievement of a reversible, mechanically tunable perovskite&#8208;based CPL switch activated by biaxial stretching, which enables flexible, dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels capable of decrypting preset information in specific polarization states. This work can provide new insights for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in information encryption, flexible 3D displays and beyond.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols, the reactivity of 3&#8208;vinylazetidin&#8208;3&#8208;ols 1 and 3&#8208;vinyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;ols 2 under transition metal catalysis remains largely unexplored. We report herein their unique reactivity under dual palladium and acid catalysis. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2(PPh3)2, AgTFA and triflic acid, the reaction of 1 or 2 with aryl iodides affords 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydrofurans, which are valuable heterocycles in organic synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that this arylative ring&#8208;expansion reaction proceeds via a domino process involving Heck arylation of alkene, acid&#8208;catalyzed transposition of allylic alcohol and ring opening of the azetidine/oxetane by an internal hydroxyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sensitive Technique Unravels the Kinetics of Activation and Trans&#8208;Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activation of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system requires the formation of a crRNA&#8208;Cas13a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and the binding of an RNA activator to the RNP. These two binding processes play a crucial role in the performance of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system. However, the binding kinetics remain poorly understood, and a main challenge is the lack of a sensitive method for real&#8208;time measurements of the dynamically formed active CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a enzyme. We describe here a new method to study the binding kinetics and report the rate constants (kon and koff) and dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding between Cas13a and its activator. The method is able to unravel and quantify the kinetics of binding and cleavage separately, on the basis of measuring the real&#8208;time trans&#8208;cleavage rates of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system and obtaining the real&#8208;time concentrations of the active CRISPR&#8208;Cas ternary complex. We further discovered that once activated, the Cas13a system operates at a wide range of temperatures (7&#8211;37 &#176;C) with fast trans&#8208;cleavage kinetics. The new method and findings are important for diverse applications of the Cas13a system, such as the demonstrated quantification of microRNA at ambient temperatures (e.g., 25 &#176;C).</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of An In&#8208;Situ Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Realising Stable Zn Metal Anode under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth understanding of the composition&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the basis of developing a reliable SEI to stablize the Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface, but it remains unclear in rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries. Herein, a well&#8208;designed electrolyte based on 2M Zn(CF3SO3)2&#8208;0.2M acrylamide&#8208;0.2M ZnSO4 is proposed. A robust polymer (polyacrylamide)&#8208;inorganic (Zn4SO4(OH)6.xH2O) hybrid SEI is in&#8208;situ constructed on Zn anodes through controllable polymerization of acrylamide and coprecipitation of SO42&#8208; with Zn2+ and OH&#8208;. For the first time, the underlying SEI composition&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship is systematically investigated and correlated. The results showed that the polymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI, which integrates the high modulus of the inorganic component with the high toughness of the polymer ingredient, can realize high reversibility and long&#8208;term interfacial stability, even under ultrahigh areal current density and capacity (30 mA cm&#8208;2 ~ 30 mAh cm&#8208;2). The resultant Zn||NH4V4O10 cell also exhibits excellent cycling stability. This work will provide a guidance for the rational design of SEI layers in rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lipopeptidomimetic of Transcriptional Activation Domains Selectively Disrupts Med25 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short amphipathic peptides are capable of binding to transcriptional coactivators, often targeting the same binding surfaces as native transcriptional activation domains. However, they do so with modest affinity and generally poor selectivity, limiting their utility as synthetic modulators. Here we show that incorporation of a medium&#8208;chain, branched fatty acid to the N&#8208;terminus of one such heptameric lipopeptidomimetic (LPPM&#8208;8) increases the affinity for the coactivator Med25 &gt;20&#8208;fold (Ki &gt;100 &#956;M to 4 &#956;M), rendering it an effective inhibitor of Med25 protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). The lipid structure, the peptide sequence, and the C&#8208;terminal functionalization of the lipopeptidomimetic each influence the structural propensity of LPPM&#8208;8 and its effectiveness as an inhibitor. LPPM&#8208;8 engages Med25 through interaction with the H2 face of its Activator Interaction Domain and in doing so stabilizes full&#8208;length protein in the cellular proteome. Further, genes regulated by Med25&#8208;activator PPIs are inhibited in a cell model of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. Thus, LPPM&#8208;8 is a useful tool for studying Med25 and Mediator complex biology and the results indicate that lipopeptidomimetics may be a robust source of inhibitors for activator&#8208;coactivator complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Chemiluminescent Probe for Imaging of Macrophage Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a role in both pro&#8208;and anti&#8208;tumor functions; and detection of M1 TAMs is imperative to assess cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy. However, many&#160;optical probes&#160;suffer from shallow tissue penetration depth and poor specificity toward M1 TAMs. Herein, we report a tandem&#8208;locked NIR chemiluminescent (CL) probe for imaging&#160;of M1 TAM during cancer immunotherapy. Through a combined molecular engineering approach via both atomic alternation and introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores are screened out to possess record&#8208;long emission (over 800 nm), record&#8208;high CL quantum yield (2.7% einstein/mol), and prolonged half&#8208;life (7.7 h). Based on an ideal chemiluminophore, the tandem&#8208;locked probe (DPDGN) is developed to only activate CL signal in the presence of both tumour (&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase) and M1 macrophage biomarkers (nitric oxide). Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures its high specificity towards M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment over those in normal tissues or peripheral blood. Thus, DPDGN permits noninvasive imaging and tracking of M1 TAM activation in the tumor of living mice during therapy, showing a good correlation with ex vivo methods. This study not only reports a new molecular approach towards highly efficient chemiluminophores but also reveals the first tandem&#8208;locked CL probes for enhanced imaging specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Migratory Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkenes: Expanding the Scope to &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Diaryl Internal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed migratory functionalization of alkenes witnessed extensive development in the past few years. However, the asymmetric version of this reaction has remained largely underdeveloped owing to the difficulty in simultaneous control of both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. In addition, exploring the wider alkene substrate scope to enable more synthetically valuable applications represents another challenge in this field. In this context, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of internal alkenes involving a chain&#8208;walking process is demonstrated. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and delivers benzylic nitriles in high yields. Even &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diaryl internal alkenes, which are known to be one of the most challenging substrates of this type, could be successfully converted to the desired products with good regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by modifying the electronic and steric effects. Theoretical calculations suggest that the &#951;3&#8208;benzyl coordination mode and the aryl substituent (3,5&#8208;(OMe)2C6H3) on the diphosphite ligand are both key factors in regulating regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of 14N Nuclei</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarization techniques provide a dramatic increase in sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. In spite of the outstanding progress in solution&#8208;state hyperpolarization of spin&#8208;1/2 nuclei, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar nuclei remains challenging. Here, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar 14N nuclei with natural isotopic abundance of &gt;99% is demonstrated. This is achieved via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to tetraalkylammonium salts with vinyl or allyl unsaturated moieties followed by a subsequent polarization transfer from 1H to 14N nuclei at high magnetic field using PH&#8208;INEPT or PH&#8208;INEPT+ radiofrequency pulse sequence. Catalyst screening identified water&#8208;soluble rhodium complex [Rh(P(m&#8208;C6H4SO3Na)3)3Cl] as the most efficient catalyst for hyperpolarization of the substrates under study, providing up to 1.3% and up to 6.6% 1H polarization in the cases of vinyl and allyl precursors, respectively. The performance of PH&#8208;INEPT and PH&#8208;INEPT+ pulse sequences was optimized with respect to inter&#8208;pulse delays, and the resultant experimental dependences were in good agreement with simulations. As a result, 14N NMR signal enhancement of up to 760&#8208;fold at 7.05 T (corresponding to 0.23% 14N polarization) was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing &#960;&#8208;&#960; Superposition Effect of Tetralithium Naphthalenetetracarboxylate with Electron Delocalization for Robust Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organics are gaining significance as electrode materials due to their merits of multi&#8208;electron reaction sites, flexible rearrangeable structures and redox reversibility. However, organics encounter finite electronic conductivity and inferior durability especially in organic electrolytes. To circumvent above barriers, we propose a novel design strategy, constructing conductive network structures with extended &#960;&#8208;&#960; superposition effect by manipulating intermolecular interaction. Tetralithium 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylate (LNTC) interwoven by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) forms LNTC@CNTs composite firstly for Li&#8208;ion storage, where multiple conjugated carboxyls contribute sufficient Li&#8208;ion storage sites, the unique network feature enables electrolyte and charge mobility conveniently combining electron delocalization in &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and the enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; superposition effect between LNTC and CNTs endows laudable structural robustness. Accordingly, LNTC@CNTs maintain an excellent Li&#8208;ion storage capacity retention of 96.4% after 400 cycles. Electrochemical experiments and theoretical simulations elucidate the fast reaction kinetics and reversible Li&#8208;ion storage stability owing to the electron delocalization and &#960;&#8208;&#960; superposition effect, while conjugated carboxyls are reversibly rearranged into enolates during charging/discharging. Consequently, a dual&#8208;ion battery combining this composite anode and expanded graphite cathode exhibits a peak specific capacity of 122 mAh g&#8722;1 and long cycling life with a capacity retention of 84.2% after 900 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Completely Non&#8208;fused Low&#8208;cost Acceptor Enables Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 17% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the industrial requirements of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, it is imperative to accelerate the development of cost&#8208;effective materials. Thiophene&#8208;benzene&#8208;thiophene central unit&#8208;based acceptors possess the advantage of low synthetic cost, while their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is relatively low. Here, by incorporating a para&#8208;substituted benzene unit and 1st&#8208;position branched alkoxy chains with large steric hindrance, a completely non&#8208;fused NFA, TBT&#8208;26, was designed and synthesized. The narrow bandgap of 1.38 eV ensures the effective utilization of sunlight. The favorable phase separation morphology of TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based blend film facilitates the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in corresponding cells. Therefore, the TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based small&#8208;area cell achieves an impressive PCE of 17.0%, which is the highest value of completely non&#8208;fused OPV cells. Additionally, we successfully demonstrated the scalability of this design by fabricating a 28.8 cm2 module with a high PCE of 14.3%. Overall, our work provides a practical molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost acceptors, paving the way for industrial applications of OPV technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Atom Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Activation in a Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving active site engineering at the atomic level poses a significant challenge in the design and optimization of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient catalytic processes, especially for a reaction with two reactants competitively absorbed on catalytic active sites. Herein we show an example that tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8208;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8208;Cl to &#8208;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that this variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation. As a result, exceptional low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation performance was achieved with T25(Temperature for 25% conversion) = 35&#176;C and T100 (Temperature for 100% conversion) = 150&#176;C, which stands out from existing MOF&#8208;based catalysts and even rivals many noble metal catalysts. This work provides a guidance for the rational design of catalysts for efficient oxygen activation for an oxidation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Characterization and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease&#8208;Relevant Tau Aggregates in Human Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the protein tau play key roles in the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). While the molecular structure of the filamentous tau aggregates has been determined to atomic resolution, there is far less information available about the smaller, soluble aggregates, which are believed to be more toxic. Traditional techniques are limited to bulk measures and struggle to identify individual aggregates in complex biological samples. To address this, we developed a novel single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down&#8208;based assay (MAPTau) to detect and characterize individual tau aggregates in AD and control post&#8208;mortem brain and biofluids. Using MAPTau, we report the quantity, as well as the size and circularity of tau aggregates measured using super&#8208;resolution microscopy, revealing AD&#8208;specific differences in tau aggregate morphology. By adapting MAPTau to detect multiple phosphorylation markers in individual aggregates using two&#8208;color coincidence detection, we derived compositional profiles of the individual aggregates. We find an AD specific phosphorylation profile of tau aggregates with more than 80% containing multiple phosphorylations, compared to 5% in age&#8208;matched non&#8208;AD controls. Our results show that MAPTau is able to identify disease&#8208;specific subpopulations of tau aggregates phosphorylated at different sites, that are invisible to other methods and enable the study of disease mechanisms and diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Network Breakdown Boosts Selective CO2 Photoreduction by Suppressing H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional strategies for highly efficient and selective CO2&#160;photoreduction focus on the design of&#160;catalysts and cocatalysts. In this study, we discover that hydrogen bond network breakdown in reaction system can suppress H2&#160;evolution, thereby improving CO2&#160;photoreduction&#160;performance. Photosensitive poly(ionic liquid)s&#160;are designed as photocatalysts owing to&#160;their strong hydrogen bonding&#160;with solvents.&#160;The hydrogen bond strength is tuned by solvent composition, thereby effectively regulating H2&#160;evolution&#160;(from 0 to 12.6 mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). No H2&#160;is detected after hydrogen bond network breakdown with trichloromethane&#160;or tetrachloromethane&#160;as&#160;additives. CO production rate&#160;and&#160;selectivity increase to 35.4 mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;and 98.9% with trichloromethane, compared with 0.6 mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;and 26.2%, respectively, without trichloromethane. Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations confirm that trichloromethane&#160;broke the systemic hydrogen bond network and subsequently suppressed H2&#160;evolution. This hydrogen bond network breakdown strategy may be extended to other catalytic reactions involving H2&#160;evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Stereo&#8208;Induction Pattern in Pudovik Addition/Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement towards Chiral Trisubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the significance of chiral allene skeletons in catalysis, organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry et al., there is a scarcity of reports on axially chiral allenyl phosphorus compounds. Here, we disclosed an efficient and straightforward cascade reaction between ethynyl ketones and phosphine oxides, resulting in a broad array of trisubstituted allenes incorporating a phosphorus moiety in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities, facilitated by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. Additionally, a comprehensive series of mechanistic experiments have been conducted to elucidate that this cascade reaction proceeds via an asymmetric Pudovik addition reaction followed by a subsequent phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement that occurs concomitantly with kinetic resolution, representing a stereospecific rearrangement and protonation process facilitating central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer in a cascade manner. We anticipate that our research will pave the way for a promising exploration of a novel stereo&#8208;induction pattern in the Pudovik addition/phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement cascade reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy Synthetic Access to High&#8208;Melting Sulfurated Copolymers and their Self&#8208;Assembling Block Polymers from Phenylisothiocyanate and Oxetane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although sulfurated polymers promise unique properties, their controlled synthesis, particularly when it comes to complex and functional architectures, remains challenging. Here, we show that the copolymerization of oxetane and phenyl isothiocyanate quantitatively yields polythioimidocarbonates as a new class of sulfur containing polymer, with narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn = 5&#8211;80 kg/mol with &#272; &#8804; 1.2; Mn,max = 124 kg/mol) and high melting points of up to 181 &#186;C. The method tolerates different substituent patterns on both the oxetane and the isothiocyanate. Self&#8208;nucleation experiments reveal that &#960;&#8208;stacking of phenyl substituents, the presence of unsubstituted polymer backbones, and the kinetically controlled linkage selectivity are key factors in maximising &#160;melting points. The increased tolerance to macro&#8208;chain transfer agents and the controlled propagation allows the synthesis of double crystalline and amphiphilic block copolymers, which can be assembled into micellar&#8208; and worm&#8208;like structures with amorphous cores in water. While in ethanol, crystallization driven self&#8208;assembly gives cylindrical micelles or platelets.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co Metallic Heterostructure as a Highly Active Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the novel metallic heterostructure Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co was prepared and exhibited excellent water splitting performance. This metallic heterostructure enhances the electron transport efficiency and accelerates the reaction rate of water molecules on its surface by optimizing the electronic structure of the heterointerface.







Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis holds promise for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, yet it encounters challenges like high voltage and limited stability at higher current densities, primarily due to inefficient electron transport kinetics. Herein, a novel cobalt&#8208;based metallic heterostructure (Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co) is designed for excellent water electrolysis. In operando Raman experiments reveal that the formation of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface boosts the free water adsorption and dissociation, increasing the available protons for subsequent hydrogen production. Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface optimizes &#916;GH of the nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby enhancing the overall HER performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH&#8722; adsorption rate, coupled with great adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction accelerates electron transport, expediting the afore&#8208;mentioned reaction steps and enhancing water splitting efficiency. The Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co electrocatalyst in the water electrolyzer delivers excellent performance, with a low 1.58&#8197;V cell voltage at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and maintains 100&#8201;% retention over 100&#8197;hours at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer.

Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of the Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N heterointerface optimizes &#916;G&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; of the nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby enhancing the overall HER performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption rate, coupled with great adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction accelerates electron transport, expediting the afore-mentioned reaction steps and enhancing water splitting efficiency. The Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N/Co electrocatalyst in the water electrolyzer delivers excellent performance, with a low 1.58&#8197;V cell voltage at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and maintains 100&#8201;% retention over 100&#8197;hours at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing the Pt/C||RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyzer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Promoted Cycloadditions in Lipid Bilayers Triggered by Liposome Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon membrane fusion and lipid mixing, the embedded functional dyes undergo cycloaddition to form the covalently bound product, resulting in the emission of FRET signal, which remains even after liposome destruction.







Abstract
Due to the variety of roles served by the cell membrane, its composition and structure are complex, making it difficult to study. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as the strain promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), are powerful tools for exploring the function of biomolecules in their native environment but have been largely unexplored within the context of lipid bilayers. Here, we developed a new approach to study the SPAAC reaction in liposomal membranes using azide&#8208; and strained alkyne&#8208;functionalized F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dye pairs. This study represents the first characterization of the SPAAC reaction between diffusing molecules inside liposomal membranes. Potential applications of this work include in situ bioorthogonal labeling of membrane proteins, improved understanding of membrane dynamics and fluidity, and the generation of new probes for biosensing assays.

         <title>Intermediate Color Emission via Nanographenes with Organic Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanographenes (NGs) produced by top&#8208;down methods carry multiple functional groups. We utilized this aspect for the reproduction of purple light by adding red&#8208; and blue&#8208;light emitting fluorophores. Based on our results, NGs can be utilized as carriers of fluorophores capable of generating intermediate colors of light.







Abstract
Photoluminescence (PL) color can be tuned by mixing fluorophores emitting the three primary colors in an appropriate ratio. When color tuning is achieved on a single substrate, we can simplify device structures. We demonstrated that nanographenes (NGs), which are graphene fragments with a size of tens of nanometers, could be utilized as carriers of fluorophores. The addition of red&#8208; and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting fluorophores on the edge successfully reproduced the purple light. The relative PL intensities of the fluorophores could be regulated by the excitation wavelength, enabling multicolor emission between blue and red light. Owing to the triphenylamine units of the fluorophores, the NGs showed PL enhancement due to aggregation. This characteristic was valuable for the fabrication of solid polymer materials. Specifically, the functionalized NGs can be dispersed into polyvinylidene difluoride. The resultant polymer films emitted red, blue, and purple color. Our study demonstrated the potential applicability of NGs for fluorophore carriers capable of reproducing intermediate colors of light.

         <title>Supramolecular Genome Editing: Targeted Delivery and Endogenous Activation of CRISPR/Cas9 by Dynamic Host&#8208;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a kind of supramolecular cationic polymer bearing cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) for the delivery of the plasmid encoding destabilized Cas9 (dsCas9) and single&#8208;guide RNA. The dynamic host&#8208;guest complexation between CB[7] moieties and trimethoprim, a stabilizer for dsCas9, can be competitively decomplexed by elevated polyamines in the tumor cells to activate Cas9&#8208;based genome editing in vivo, thereby ensuring the highly specific therapeutic genome editing for cancer gene therapy.







Abstract
We synthesize supramolecular poly(disulfide) (CPS) containing covalently attached cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), which is exploited not only as a carrier to deliver plasmid DNA encoding destabilized Cas9 (dsCas9), but also as a host to include trimethoprim (TMP) by CB[7] moieties through the supramolecular complexation to form TMP@CPS/dsCas9. Once the plasmid is transfected into tumor cells by CPS, the presence of polyamines can competitively trigger the decomplexation of TMP@CPS, thereby displacing and releasing TMP from CB[7] to stabilize dsCas9 that can target and edit the genomic locus of PLK1 to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Following the systemic administration of TMP@CPS/dsCas9 decorated with hyaluronic acid (HA), tumor&#8208;specific editing of PLK1 is detected due to the elevated polyamines in tumor microenvironment, greatly minimizing off&#8208;target editing in healthy tissues and non&#8208;targeted organs. As the metabolism of polyamines is dysregulated in a wide range of disorders, this study offers a supramolecular approach to precisely control CRISPR/Cas9 functions under particular pathological contexts.

         <title>Development of a Small Molecule Downmodulator for the Transcription Factor Brachyury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small&#8208;molecule brachyury downmodulator DHC&#8208;156 was developed through the optimization of afatinib, an FDA&#8208;approved inhibitor. A series of structure&#8211;activity relationships, guided by biochemical assays and crystallography, lead to the discovery of DHC&#8208;156, which was shown to spare all wild&#8208;type kinases and downmodulates brachyury in a post&#8208;translational manner.







Abstract
Brachyury is an oncogenic transcription factor whose overexpression drives chordoma growth. The downmodulation of brachyury in chordoma cells has demonstrated therapeutic potential, however, as a transcription factor it is classically deemed &#8220;undruggable&#8221;. Given that direct pharmacological intervention against brachyury has proven difficult, attempts at intervention have instead targeted upstream kinases. Recently, afatinib, an FDA&#8208;approved kinase inhibitor, has been shown to modulate brachyury levels in multiple chordoma cell lines. Herein, we use afatinib as a lead to undertake a structure&#8208;based drug design approach, aided by mass&#8208;spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography, to develop DHC&#8208;156, a small molecule that more selectively binds brachyury and downmodulates it as potently as afatinib. We eliminated kinase&#8208;inhibition from this novel scaffold while demonstrating that DHC&#8208;156 induces the post&#8208;translational downmodulation of brachyury that results in an irreversible impairment of chordoma tumor cell growth. In doing so, we demonstrate the feasibility of direct brachyury modulation, which may further be developed into more potent tool compounds and therapies.

         <dc:description>
PTFBK has been employed as a multifunctional additive to target and modulate bulk perovskite defects and carrier dynamics of PSCs, endowing the decrease of Young&#8242;s modulus and residual stress in the perovskite layer. Moreover, benefit to the dominant crystal orientation and the suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination, excellent stable inverted device with PCE of 24.99% was achieved.

The main obstacles to promoting the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) include their record power conversion efficiency (PCE), which still remains below the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit, and poor long&#8208;term stability, attributable to crystallographic defects in perovskite films and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss in devices. In this study, potassium (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonylpiperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl) methyl trifluoroborate (PTFBK) was employed as a multifunctional additive to target and modulate bulk perovskite defects and carrier dynamics of PSCs. Apart from simultaneously passivating anionic and cationic defects, PTFBK could also optimize the energy&#8208;level alignment of devices and weaken the interaction between carriers and longitudinal optical phonons, resulting in a carrier lifetime of greater than 3&#8197;&#956;s. Furthermore, it inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved the crystallization capacity in the target perovskite film. Hence, the target rigid and flexible p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs yielded champion PCEs of 24.99&#8201;% and 23.48&#8201;%, respectively. More importantly, due to hydrogen bonding between formamidinium and fluorine, the target devices exhibited remarkable thermal, humidity, and operational tracking at maximum power point stabilities. The reduced Young's modulus and residual stress in the perovskite layer also provided excellent bending stability for flexible target devices.

         <title>Mechanocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia: State of the Catalyst During Reaction and Deactivation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ammonia over a Cs&#8208;promoted Fe catalyst via the novel approach of mechanocatalysis is carefully studied by ex situ characterizations of the catalyst. Physicochemical changes are related to the different stages of ammonia formation. Optimizations based on these results resulted in the intrinsically complicated low&#8208;temperature ammonia synthesis being one of the longest stable mechanocatalytic gas&#8208;phase reactions to date.







Abstract
Ammonia synthesis holds significant importance for both agricultural fertilizer production and emerging green energy applications. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of a catalyst for mechanochemical ammonia synthesis, based on Cs&#8208;promoted Fe. The study sheds light on the catalyst&#8216;s dynamic evolution under reaction conditions and the origin of deactivation. Initially, elemental Cs converts to CsH, followed by partial CsOH formation due to trace oxygen impurities on the surface of the Fe metal and the equipment. Concurrently, the mechanical milling process comminutes Fe, exposing fresh metallic Fe surfaces. This comminution correlates with an induction period observed during ammonia formation. Critical to the study, degradation of active Cs promoter species (CsH and CsNH2) into inactive CsOH emerged as the primary deactivation mechanism. By increasing the Cs content from 2.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% to 4.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%, we achieved stable, continuous ammonia synthesis for nearly 90&#8197;hours, showcasing one of the longest&#8208;running mechanocatalytic gas phase reactions. Studies of the temperature dependence of the reaction revealed negligible bulk temperature influence in the range of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to 100&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the dominance of mechanical action over bulk thermal effects. This study offers insights into the complex interplay between mechanical processing, reactive species, and deactivation mechanisms in mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Thiophene Based Conjugated Polymer Cathode with High Capacity for Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new porphyrin conjugated polymer cathode, COP500&#8208;CuT2TP is achieved under electrochemical polymerization. Self&#8208;exfoliation of polymer cathode promotes charge storage, leading to a specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 900&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&#8722;1. Excellent cycling stability up to 8000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved. Mechanistic insights by combining experimental and computational investigations supports the charge storage performance.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage materials due to their environmental friendliness and sustainable renewability. However, problems such as their high solubility in electrolytes and low intrinsic conductivity have always plagued their further application. Polymerization to form conjugated organic polymers can not only inhibit the dissolution of organic electrodes in the electrolyte, but also enhance the intrinsic conductivity of organic molecules. Herein, we synthesized a new conjugated organic polymer (COPs) COP500&#8208;CuT2TP (poly [5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl) porphyrinato] copper (II)) by electrochemical polymerization method. Due to the self&#8208;exfoliation behavior, the porphyrin cathode exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high specific energy of 900&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&#8722;1 with a first coulombic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Excellent cycling stability up to 8000&#8197;cycles without capacity loss was achieved even at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This highly conjugated structure promotes COP500&#8208;CuT2TP combined high energy density, high power density, and good cycling stability, which would open new opportunity for the designable and versatile organic electrodes for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Descriptor&#8208;Based Volcano Relations Predict Single Atoms for Hydroxylamine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior hydroxylamine (NH2OH) selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proven to enhance NH2OH formation.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is an important feedstock in fuels, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Nanostructured electrocatalysts drive green electrosynthesis of hydroxylamine from nitrogen oxide species in water. However, current electrocatalysts still suffer from low selectivity and manpower&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error modes, leaving unclear selectivity/activity origins and a lack of catalyst design principles. Herein, we theoretically analyze key determinants of selectivity/activity and propose the adsorption energy of NHO (Gad(*NHO)) as a performance descriptor. A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior NH2OH selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict a series of SACs and discover Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. These theoretical prediction results are also confirmed by experimental results, rationalizing our Gad(*NHO) descriptor. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proved to enhance NH2OH formation.

         <title>SN2 Reaction at the Amide Nitrogen Center Enables Hydrazide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N&#8722;N coupling approach to the practical synthesis of hydrazides is disclosed by employing an SN2 strategy at electrophilic amides with nucleophilic amines. The reaction exhibits mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, easy scalability, and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage modification of various approved drug molecules, thus enabling complex hydrazide scaffold synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions are fundamentally important transformations in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite the substantial advances in bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions (SN2) at saturated carbon centers, analogous SN2 reaction at the amide nitrogen atom remains extremely limited. Here we report an SN2 substitution method at the amide nitrogen atom with amine nucleophiles for nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bond formation that leads to a novel strategy toward biologically and medicinally important hydrazide derivatives. We found the use of sulfonate&#8208;leaving groups at the amide nitrogen atom played a pivotal role in the reaction. This new N&#8722;N coupling reaction allows the use of O&#8208;tosyl hydroxamates as electrophiles and readily available amines, including acyclic aliphatic amines and saturated N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples), excellent functional group tolerability, and scalability. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of various approved drug molecules, thus enabling complex hydrazide scaffold synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A new N&#8722;N coupling approach to the practical synthesis of hydrazides is disclosed by employing an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 strategy at electrophilic amides with nucleophilic amines.

         <title>Ultrafast Biomimetic Oxidative Folding of Cysteine&#8208;rich Peptides and Microproteins in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, we established a method that replicates a hydrophobic environment akin to that of the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to effective suppression in dead&#8208;end products and acceleration of reaction rates through high thiolate concentrations for the oxidative folding of cysteine&#8208;rich peptides and microproteins.







Abstract
Disulfides in peptides and proteins are essential for maintaining a properly folded structure. Their oxidative folding is invariably performed in an aqueous&#8208;buffered solution. However, this process is often slow and can lead to misfolded products. Here, we report a novel concept and strategy that is bio&#8208;inspired to mimic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) by accelerating disulfide exchange rates many thousand&#8208;fold. The proposed strategy termed organic oxidative folding is performed under organic solvents to yield correctly folded cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins instantaneously without observable misfolded or dead&#8208;end products. Compared to conventional aqueous oxidative folding strategies, enormously large rate accelerations up to 113,200&#8208;fold were observed. The feasibility and generality of the organic oxidative folding strategy was successfully demonstrated on 15 cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins of different hydrophobicity, lengths (14 to 58 residues), and numbers of disulfides (2 to 5 disulfides), producing the native products in a second and in high yield.

         <title>Selective Intracellular Delivery of Antibodies in Cancer Cells with Nanocarriers Sensing Endo/Lysosomal Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endo/lysosomal cathepsin B activity differentiates among cell types and serves as a stimulus to trigger cell&#8208;specific endosomal escape. By designing nanocarriers armed with cathepsin B&#8208;activatable endosomal escape function, endosomal escape can be controlled to only occur in targeted cancer cells with upregulated endo/lysosomal cathepsin B activity. This innovative approach offers a new means to achieve targeted intracellular protein delivery.







Abstract
The differential enzymatic activity in the endo/lysosomes of particular cells could trigger targeted endosomal escape functions, enabling selective intracellular protein delivery. However, this strategy may be jeopardized due to protein degradation during endosomal trafficking. Herein, using custom made fluorescent probes to assess the endosomal activity of cathepsin B (CTSB) and protein degradation, we found that certain cancer cells with hyperacidified endosomes grant a spatiotemporal window where CTSB activity surpass protein digestion. This inspired the engineering of antibody&#8208;loaded polymeric nanocarriers having CTSB&#8208;activatable endosomal escape ability. The nanocarriers selectively escaped from the endo/lysosomes in the cells with high endosomal CTSB activity and delivered active antibodies to intracellular targets. This study provides a viable strategy for cell&#8208;specific protein delivery using stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers with controlled endosomal escape.

         <title>Graphitic Armor: A Natural Molecular Sieve for Robust Hydrogen Electroxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, graphite armor serves as a natural molecule sieve screening out bulky adversative molecules like O2 or CO but allowing H2 to diffuse along both the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane direction. This creates perfect chance for fabricating robust HOR electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon coating layers have been found to improve the catalytic performance of transition metals, which is usually explained as an outcome of electronic synergistic effect. Herein we reveal that the defective graphitic carbon, with a unique interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, can be a highly selective natural molecular sieve. It allows efficient diffusion of hydrogen molecules or radicals both along the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, but sterically hinders the diffusion of molecules with larger kinetic diameter (e.g., CO and O2) along the in&#8208;plane direction. As a result, poisonous species lager than 0.342&#8197;nm are sieved out, even when their adsorption on the metal is thermodynamically strong; at the same time, the interaction between H2 and the metal is not affected. This natural molecular sieve provides a very chance for constructing robust metal catalysts for hydrogen&#8208;relevant processes, which are more tolerant to chemical or electrochemical oxidation or CO&#8208;relevant poisoning.

         <title>Flexible Zn&#8208;ion Electrochromic Batteries with Multiple&#8208;color Variations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>

The flexible Zn&#8208;ion electrochromic battery (ZIEB) with multiple color conversion, satisfactory capacity and superior cycle stability was assembled for real&#8208;time energy monitoring through visual color conversion.







Abstract
Electrochromic batteries as emerging smart energy devices are highly sought after owing to their real&#8208;time energy monitoring through visual color conversion. However, their large&#8208;scale applicability is hindered by insufficient capacity, inadequate cycling stability, and limited color variation. Herein, a flexible Zn&#8208;ion electrochromic battery (ZIEB) was assembled with sodium vanadate (VONa+) cathode, ion&#8208;redistributing hydrogel electrolyte, and Zn anode to address these challenges. The electrolyte contains anchored &#8722;SO3&#8722; and &#8208;NH3+, which facilitates ionic transportation and prevents Zn dendrite formation by promoting orientated Zn2+ deposition on the Zn (002) surface. The ZIEB exhibits a continuous reversible color transition, ranging from fully charged orange to mid&#8208;charged brown and drained green. It also demonstrates a high specific capacity of 302.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 96.3&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, the ZIEB maintains stable energy output even under bending, rolling, knotting, and twisting. This work paves a new strategy for the design of smart energy devices in wearable electronics.

         <title>Creating 3D Nanoparticle Structural Space via Data Augmentation to Bidirectionally Predict Nanoparticle Mixture's Purity, Size, and Shape from Extinction Spectra</title>

Leveraging plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment and machine learning&#8208;directed data augmentation to create a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoparticle structural space for bidirectional predictions of silver nanocube's purity, size, and shape (corner radius) in as&#8208;synthesized nanoparticle mixtures using extinction spectra and vice versa.







Abstract
Nanoparticle (NP) characterization is essential because diverse shapes, sizes, and morphologies inevitably occur in as&#8208;synthesized NP mixtures, profoundly impacting their properties and applications. Currently, the only technique to concurrently determine these structural parameters is electron microscopy, but it is time&#8208;intensive and tedious. Here, we create a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) NP structural space to concurrently determine the purity, size, and shape of 1000 sets of as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanocubes mixtures containing interfering nanospheres and nanowires from their extinction spectra, attaining low predictive errors at 2.7&#8211;7.9&#8201;%. We first use plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment to extract localized surface plasmon resonance attributes from spectra and establish a lasso regressor (LR) model to predict purity, size, and shape. Leveraging the learned LR, we artificially generate 425,592 augmented extinction spectra to overcome data scarcity and create a comprehensive NP structural space to bidirectionally predict extinction spectra from structural parameters with &lt;4&#8201;% error. Our interpretable NP structural space further elucidates the two higher&#8208;order combined electric dipole, quadrupole, and magnetic dipole as the critical structural parameter predictors. By incorporating other NP shapes and mixtures&#8242; extinction spectra, we anticipate our approach, especially the data augmentation, can create a fully generalizable NP structural space to drive on&#8208;demand, autonomous synthesis&#8208;characterization platforms.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Macrocyclization towards Crown Ethers Using Hydroamination of Bis(allenes)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of bis(allenes) with diamines was found to be an efficient strategy to access chiral crown ethers starting from achiral substrates. This new strategy is characterized by high chemo&#8208;, enantio&#8208;and diastereoselectivity with a wide range of substrates and with good functional group tolerance to access a wide range of chiral macrocycles in high yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
Enantiomerically enriched crown ethers (CE) exhibit strong asymmetric induction in phase transfer catalysis, supramolecular catalysis and molecular recognition processes. Traditional methods have often been used to access these valuable compounds, which limit their diversity and consequently their applicability. Herein, a practical catalytic method is described for the gram scale synthesis of a class of chiral CEs (aza&#8208;crown ethers; ACEs) using Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of bis(allenes) with diamines. Using this approach, a wide range of chiral vinyl functionalized CEs with ring sizes ranging from 12 to 36 have been successfully prepared in high yields of up to 92&#8201;%, dr of up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and er of up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1. These vinyl substituted CEs allow for further diversification giving facile access to various CE derivatives as well as to their three&#8208;dimensional analogues using ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Some of these chiral CEs themselves display high potential for use in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Binding of Precursors to Replicator Assemblies Can Improve Replication Fidelity and Mediate Error Correction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of precursor molecules to the side of a fibrous assembly of self&#8208;replicating macrocycles can improve the fidelity of replication and yield a novel error&#8208;correction mechanism, provided that the fibers bind selectively to precursors that match the building&#8208;block composition of the replicator.







Abstract
Copying information is vital for life&#8216;s propagation. Current life forms maintain a low error rate in replication, using complex machinery to prevent and correct errors. However, primitive life had to deal with higher error rates, limiting its ability to evolve. Discovering mechanisms to reduce errors would alleviate this constraint. Here, we introduce a new mechanism that decreases error rates and corrects errors in synthetic self&#8208;replicating systems driven by self&#8208;assembly. Previous work showed that macrocycle replication occurs through the accumulation of precursor material on the sides of the fibrous replicator assemblies. Stochastic simulations now reveal that selective precursor binding to the fiber surface enhances replication fidelity and error correction. Centrifugation experiments show that replicator fibers can exhibit the necessary selectivity in precursor binding. Our results suggest that synthetic replicator systems are more evolvable than previously thought, encouraging further evolution&#8208;focused experiments.

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Rhodium (III) Complexes in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photothermal Heterogeneous C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a general post&#8208;synthetic strategy for constructing bifunctional catalysts, Rh&#8208;COF, which connect photosensitive covalent organic frameworks and transition&#8208;metal catalytic groups through covalent bonding, was developed. Fascinatingly, such complexes enable efficient photothermal conversion properties, which can improve the photothermal catalytic performances in C&#8722;H activation to obtain excellent yield, substrate suitability and recyclability.







Abstract
Although photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation has been realized by using heterogeneous catalysts, most of them require high&#8208;temperature conditions to provide the energy required for C&#8722;H bond breakage. The catalysts with photothermal conversion properties can catalyze this reaction efficiently at room temperature, but so far, these catalysts have been rarely developed. Here, we construct bifunctional catalysts Rh&#8208;COF&#8208;316 and &#8208;318 to combine photosensitive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and transition&#8208;metal catalytic moiety using a post&#8208;synthetic approach. The Rh&#8208;COF enable the heterogeneous C&#8722;H activation reaction by photothermal conversion for the first time, and exhibit excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and broad scope of substrates in [4+2] annulation at room temperature, while maintaining the high stability and recyclability. Significantly, this work is the highest yield reported so far in porous materials catalyzing C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) formation at room temperature. The excellent performances can be attributed to the COF&#8208;316, which enhances the photothermal effect (&#916;T=50.9&#8201;&#176;C), thus accelerating C&#8722;H bond activation and the exchange of catalyst with substrates.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Activated Boron Nitride for Selective Photocatalytic Coupling of Methanol to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;activated boron nitride fibers (BNH) have been successfully synthesized and applied for the selective photocatalytic coupling of methanol to ethylene glycol (EG) reaction. The OB3 unit in the BNH plays an important role in the selective dehydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling of methanol molecules, leading to excellent activity and selectivity of BNH for EG production.







Abstract
The controllable photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling of methanol to produce ethylene glycol (EG) is a highly desirable but challenging objective for replacing the current energy&#8208;intensive thermocatalytic process. Here, we develop a metal&#8208;free porous boron nitride catalyst that demonstrates exceptional selectivity in the photocatalytic production of EG from methanol under mild conditions. Comprehensive experiments and calculations are conducted to thoroughly investigate the reaction mechanism, revealing that the OB3 unit in the porous BN plays a critical role in the preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form &#8901;CH2OH via a concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer mechanism. More prominent energy barriers are observed for the further dehydrogenation of the &#8901;CH2OH intermediate on the OB3 unit, inhibiting the formation of some other by&#8208;products during the catalytic process. Additionally, a small downhill energy barrier for the coupling of &#8901;CH2OH in the OB3 unit promotes the selective generation of EG. This study provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and can serve as a guide for the design and optimization of photocatalysts for efficient and selective EG production under mild conditions.

More prominent energy barriers are observed for the further dehydrogenation of the &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH intermediate on the OB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit, inhibiting the formation of some other by-products during the catalytic process. Additionally, a small downhill energy barrier for the coupling of &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH in the OB&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit promotes the selective generation of EG. This study provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and can serve as a guide for the design and optimization of photocatalysts for efficient and selective EG production under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Doping and Structural Modulation of Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a foundational understanding of an electrochemical strategy for doping and structurally modulating electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Additionally, various applications of these MOFs have been developed based on their distinct electrochemical behaviors.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce an electrochemical doping strategy aimed at manipulating the structure and composition of electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs). Our methodology is exemplified through a representative c&#8208;MOF, Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP=2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene), synthesized into porous thin films supported by nanocellulose. While the c&#8208;MOF exhibits characteristic capacitive behavior in neutral electrolyte; it manifests redox behaviors in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Evidence indicates that the organic ligands within c&#8208;MOF undergo oxidation (p&#8208;doping) and reduction (n&#8208;doping) when exposed to specific electrochemical potentials in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Interestingly, the p&#8208;doping process proves reversible, with the c&#8208;MOF structure remaining stable across cyclic p&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping. In contrast, the n&#8208;doping is irreversible, leading to the gradual decomposition of the framework into inorganic species over a few cycles. Drawing on these findings, we showcase the versatile electrochemical applications of c&#8208;MOFs and their derived composites, encompassing electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis, and ultrafast actuation. This study provides profound insights into the doping of c&#8208;MOFs, offering a new avenue for modulating their chemical and electronic structure, thereby broadening their potential for diverse electrochemical applications.

         <title>Thiophene &#960;&#8208;Bridge Manipulation of NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Multimodal Tumor Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By elaborate thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge manipulation, BT&#8208;NS in which benzo[c]thiophene serves as &#960;&#8208;bridge is constructed. An integration of experimental and theoretical studies disclosed BT&#8208;NS is advantageous for NIR&#8208;II FLI/PAI/PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT/PTT treatment of tumors, displaying outstanding therapeutic efficacy and excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
The fabrication of a multimodal phototheranostic platform on the basis of single&#8208;component theranostic agent to afford both imaging and therapy simultaneously, is attractive yet full of challenges. The emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), particularly those emit fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), provides a powerful tool for cancer treatment by virtue of adjustable pathway for radiative/non&#8208;radiative energy consumption, deeper penetration depth and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance. Although bulky thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridges such as ortho&#8208;alkylated thiophene, 3,4&#8208;ethoxylene dioxythiophene and benzo[c]thiophene are commonly adopted to construct NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, the subtle differentiation on their theranostic behaviours has yet to be comprehensively investigated. In this work, systematical investigations discovered that AIEgen BT&#8208;NS bearing benzo[c]thiophene possesses acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission intensity, efficient reactive oxygen species generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Eventually, by using of BT&#8208;NS nanoparticles, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal elimination of tumors was demonstrated. This study thus offers useful insights into developing versatile phototheranostic systems for clinical trials.

         <title>Flavin&#8208;N5OOH Functions as both a Powerful Nucleophile and a Base in the Superfamily of Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational study demonstrates that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH species can function as both powerful nucleophiles and bases in the superfamily of flavoenzymes, which can mediate many kinds of challenging non&#8208;redox reactions, such as the cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, Cl) bonds. The findings revive oxygen activation chemistry by flavoenzymes and are expected to spur the discovery of many other Flavin&#8208;N5OOH&#8208;dependent enzymes.







Abstract
Flavoenzymes can mediate a large variety of oxidation reactions through the activation of oxygen. However, the O2 activation chemistry of flavin enzymes is not yet fully exploited. Normally, the O2 activation occurs at the C4a site of the flavin cofactor, yielding the flavin C4a&#8208;(hydro)hydroperoxyl species in monooxygenases or oxidases. Using extensive MD simulations, QM/MM calculations and QM calculations, our studies reveal the formation of the common nucleophilic species, Flavin&#8208;N5OOH, in two distinct flavoenzymes (RutA and EncM). Our studies show that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH acts as a powerful nucleophile that promotes C&#8722;N cleavage of uracil in RutA, and a powerful base in the deprotonation of substrates in EncM. We reason that Flavin&#8208;N5OOH can be a common reactive species in the superfamily of flavoenzymes, which accomplish generally selective general base catalysis and C&#8722;X (X=N, S, Cl, O) cleavage reactions that are otherwise challenging with solvated hydroxide ion base. These results expand our understanding of the chemistry and catalysis of flavoenzymes.

         <title>Unveiling pH&#8208;Dependent Adsorption Strength of *CO2&#8722; Intermediate over High&#8208;Density Sn Single Atom Catalyst for Acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalyst is presented and ATR&#8208;FTIR is used to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722;, a key intermediate in acidic electrolyte on its surface. It is shown that the increase of electrolyte pH results in a redshift of the peak position of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate, i.e., the adsorption strength of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate increases, which in turn affects the performance of CO2RR to direct HCOOH in acidic electrolyte.







Abstract
The acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for direct formic acid (HCOOH) production holds promise in meeting the carbon&#8208;neutral target, yet its performance is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Understanding the adsorption strength of the key intermediates in acidic electrolyte is indispensable to favor CO2RR over HER. In this work, high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalysts (SACs) were prepared and used as catalyst, to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength and coverage of *CO2&#8722; intermediatethat enables enhanced acidic CO2RR towards direct HCOOH production. At pH=3, Sn SACs could deliver a high Faradaic efficiency (90.8&#8201;%) of HCOOH formation and a corresponding partial current density up to &#8722;178.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The detailed in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopic studies reveal that a favorable alkaline microenvironment for CO2RR to HCOOH is formed near the surface of Sn SACs, even in the acidic electrolyte. More importantly, the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722; intermediate is unravelled over the Sn SACs, which in turn affects the competition between HER and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Solubilizing&#8208;Tag Facilitates the Chemical Synthesis of Mirror&#8208;Image Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag was described for the chemical synthesis of mirror&#8208;image proteins. Solubilizing tags were easily installed on the side chain groups of DLys/DSer/DThr and the N&#8208;terminal &#945;&#8208;amino group of D&#8208;peptides via an L&#8208;Lys linker. Solubilizing tags were impervious to various commonly used reagents in D&#8208;protein synthesis. After protein assembly, multiple solubilizing tags can be removed under denaturing conditions.







Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins) are useful in biomedical research for purposes such as mirror&#8208;image screening for D&#8208;peptide drug discovery, but the chemical synthesis of many D&#8208;proteins is often low yielding due to the poor solubility or aggregation of their constituent peptide segments. Here, we report a Lys&#8208;C protease&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag and its use to synthesize difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain D&#8208;proteins. Our tag is easily installed onto multiple amino acids such as DLys, DSer, DThr, and/or the N&#8208;terminal amino acid of hydrophobic D&#8208;peptides, is impervious to various reaction conditions, such as peptide synthesis, ligation, desulfurization, and transition metal&#8208;mediated deprotection, and yet can be completely removed by Lys&#8208;C protease under denaturing conditions to give the desired D&#8208;protein. The efficacy and practicality of the new method were exemplified in the synthesis of two challenging D&#8208;proteins: D&#8208;enantiomers of programmed cell death protein 1 IgV domain and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 envelope protein, in high yield. This work demonstrates that the enzymatic cleavage of solubilizing tags under denaturing conditions is feasible, thus paving the way for the production of more D&#8208;proteins.

         <title>Valence Tautomerism Induced Proton Coupled Electron Transfer:X&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with a Dinuclear Au(II) Hydroxide Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;Coupled electron transfer (PCET)&#8208;type reactivity of the dinuclear AuII hydroxide complex AuII2(L)2(OH)2 (L=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis (2,6&#8208;dimethyl) phenylformamidinate) towards weak X&#8722;H bonds is reported. For C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation Au&#8722;Au &#963;&#8208;bond polarization leads to an adjustment of oxidation levels for both Au centers prior to the PCET event. The oxidation event for C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is therefore described as a valence tautomerism induced PCET, where a basic reduced Au&#8722;OH unit serves as proton acceptor and the second more oxidized Au center as an electron acceptor.







Abstract
We report the preparation and characterization of the dinuclear AuII hydroxide complex AuII2(L)2(OH)2 (L=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis (2,6&#8208;dimethyl) phenylformamidinate) and study its reactivity towards weak X&#8722;H bonds. Through the interplay of kinetic analysis and computational studies, we demonstrate that the oxidation of cyclohexadiene follows a concerted proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (cPCET) mechanism, a rare type of reactivity for Au complexes. We find that the Au&#8722;Au &#963;&#8208;bond undergoes polarization in the PCET event leading to an adjustment of oxidation levels for both Au centers prior to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage. We thus describe the oxidation event as a valence tautomerism&#8208;induced PCET where the basicity of one reduced Au&#8722;OH unit provides a proton acceptor and the second more oxidized Au center serves as an electron acceptor. The coordination of these events allows for unprecedented radical&#8208;type reactivity by a closed shell AuII complex.

         <title>Highly Interfacial Active Gemini Surfactants as Simple and Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing, Lubricating and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid structuring usually relies on the interfacial jamming of nanoparticle surfactants. Here we show that not only droplets in non&#8208;equilibrium shapes but also printed liquid patterns with useful geometries can be created from a highly interfacial active molecular Gemini surfactant that generates elastic, &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; monolayers at the oil/water interface. The surfactant can also be used to produce ultra&#8208;stable emulsions with potent lubricity.







Abstract
To date, locking the shape of liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium states usually relies on jamming nanoparticle surfactants at an oil/water interface. Here we show that a synthetic water&#8208;soluble zwitterionic Gemini surfactant can serve as an alternative to nanoparticle surfactants for stabilizing, structuring and additionally lubricating liquids. By having a high binding energy comparable to amphiphilic nanoparticles at the paraffin oil/water interface, the surfactant can attain near&#8208;zero interfacial tensions and ultrahigh surface coverages after spontaneous adsorption. Owing to the strong association between neighboring surfactant molecules, closely packed monolayers with high mechanical elasticity can be generated at the oil/water interface, thus allowing the surfactant to produce not only ultra&#8208;stable emulsions but also structured liquids with various geometries by using extrusion printing and 3D printing techniques. By undergoing tribochemical reactions at its sulfonic terminus, the surfactant can endow the resultant emulsions with favorable lubricity even under high load&#8208;bearing conditions. Our study may provide new insights into creating complex liquid devices and new&#8208;generation lubricants capable of combining the characteristics of both liquid and solid lubricants.

         <dc:description>
A highly reversible aqueous Zn battery was built by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The design of aqueous zinc (Zn) chemistry energy storage with high rate&#8208;capability and long serving life is a great challenge due to its inhospitable coordination environment and dismal interfacial chemistry. To bridge this big gap, herein, we build a highly reversible aqueous Zn battery by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions. As a result, the engineered electrolyte system achieves a superior average coulombic efficiency of 97.27&#8201;% under 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and steady charge&#8211;discharge for 982&#8197;h under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which proposes a universal pathway to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry in green, sustainable, and large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>A Smart DNA Hydrogel Enables Synergistic Immunotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy of Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA hydrogel that responds to the inflammatory environment by releasing multivalent functional units including photodynamic units, immune&#8208;activating units, and exosome killing units is constructed. The functional units have excellent tumor cell killing and immune activation efficacy, and the functional units can also synergistically modulate the immune microenvironment for efficient combination therapy.







Abstract
Immunotherapy faces insufficient immune activation and limited immune effectiveness. Herein, we report a smart DNA hydrogel that enables the release of multivalent functional units at the tumor site to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. The smart DNA hydrogel was assembled from two types of ultra&#8208;long DNA chains synthesized via rolling circle amplification. One DNA chain contained immune adjuvant CpG oligonucleotides and polyaptamers for loading natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes; the other chain contained multivalent G&#8208;quadruplex for loading photodynamic agents. DNA chains formed DNA hydrogel through base&#8208;pairing. HhaI restriction endonuclease sites were designed between functional units. Upon stimuli in the tumor sites, the hydrogel was effectively cleaved by the released HhaI and disassembled into functional units. Natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes played an anti&#8208;tumor role, and the CpG oligonucleotide activated antigen&#8208;presenting cells to enhance the immunotherapy. Besides the tumor&#8208;killing effect of photodynamic therapy, the generated cellular debris acted as an immune antigen to further enhance the immunotherapeutic effect. In a mouse melanoma orthotopic model, the smart DNA hydrogel as a localized therapeutic agent, achieved a remarkable tumor suppression rate of 91.2&#8201;%. The smart DNA hydrogel exhibited enhanced efficacy of synergistic immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy, expanding the application of DNA materials in biomedicine.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Zn Metal via a Localized Conjugated Layer for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based zinc ion conductor (CPANZ) with a localized conjugated structure is induced and achieved at low temperature by Lewis acidic Zn(OTf)2. The CPANZ layer effectively accelerates the Zn2+ migration but restricts the H+ migration. Encouragingly, the chemical corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction and other side reactions are significantly mitigated at the CPANZ@Zn anode and homogeneous Zn deposition/dissolution is guaranteed.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as promising and efficient energy storage systems owing to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. Nevertheless, the instability of zinc metal anodes, characterized by issues such as dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions, poses a significant barrier to widespread applications. Herein, we address this challenge by designing a localized conjugated structure comprising a cyclic polyacrylonitrile polymer (CPANZ), induced by a Zn2+&#8208;based Lewis acid (zinc trifluoromethylsulfonate) at a temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C. The CPANZ layer on the Zn anode, enriched with appropriate pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich groups (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;), exhibits a notable affinity for Zn2+ with ample deposition sites. This zincophilic skeleton not only serves as a protective layer to guide the deposition of Zn2+ but also functions as proton channel blocker, regulating the proton flux to mitigate the hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the strong adhesion strength of the CPANZ layer guarantees its sustained protection to the Zn metal during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, the modified zinc electrode demonstrates long cycle life and high durability in both half&#8208;cell and pouch cells. These findings present a feasible approach to designing high performance aqueous anodes by introducing a localized conjugated layer.

         <title>Amine&#8208;releasable Mediator In situ Repair Perovskites for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amine&#8208;releasable mediator methylammonium pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic (MAPyA) is demonstrated to in situ repair the imperfections in perovskite film. The specific mechanism is that MAPyA&#8208;released methylamine gifts a crystal reconstruction environment by inducing liquid intermediate phase, thus reconvert the microcrystals and residual PbI2 to perfect perovskites in situ. The optimized device exhibits efficiency of 24.06&#8201;% and excellent photostability.







Abstract
Residual lead iodide (PbI2) is deemed to a double&#8208;edged sword in perovskite film as small amounts of PbI2 are beneficial to the photovoltaic performance, but excessive will cause degradation of photovoltaic performance and stability. Herein, an in situ repair strategy has been developed by introducing amine&#8208;releasable mediator (methylammonium pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic, MAPyA) to eliminate over&#8208;residual PbI2 and regulate the crystal quality of perovskite film. Notably, MAPyA can be partially decomposed into methylamine (MA) gas and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic (PyA) during high temperature annealing. The released MA can locally form liquid intermediate phase, facilitating the reconstruction of perovskite microcrystals and residual PbI2. Moreover, the leftover PyA is confirmed to effectively passivate the uncoordinated lead ions in final perovskite film. Based upon this, superior perovskite film with optimized crystal structure and holistic negligible PbI2 is acquired. The assembled device realizes outstanding efficiency of 24.06&#8201;%, and exhibits a remarkable operational stability that maintaining 87&#8201;% of its origin efficiency after continuous illumination for 1480&#8197;h. And the unencapsulated MAPyA&#8208;treated devices present significant uplift in humidity stability (maintaining ~93&#8201;% of the initial efficiency over 1500&#8197;h, 50&#8211;60&#8201;% relative humidity). Furthermore, the further optimization of this strategy with nanoimprint technology proves its superiority in the amplificative preparation for perovskite films.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Functional Imaging Analysis of Engineered Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) analysis was developed for accurately visualizing tumors at cellular, tissue, and animal levels by enhancing metabolic differences. The strategy will potentially aid tumor identification, analysis, and surgical guidance.







Abstract
Functional imaging (FI) techniques have revolutionized tumor imaging by providing information on specific tumor functions, such as glycometabolism. However, tumor cells lack unique molecular characteristics at the molecular level and metabolic pathways, resulting in limited metabolic differences compared to normal cells and increased background signals from FI. To address this limitation, we developed a novel imaging technique termed proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) for accurate visualization of tumors. By using &#8220;two adjacent chemically labeled glycoproteins&#8221; as output signals, we significantly enhance the metabolic differences between tumor and normal cells by PEFI, thereby reducing the background signals for analysis and improving the accuracy of tumor functional imaging. Our results demonstrate that PEFI can accurately identify tumors at the cellular, tissue, and animal level, and has potential value in clinical identification and analysis of tumor cells and tissues, as well as in the guidance of clinical tumor resection surgery.

         <title>Where do the Fluorine Atoms Go in Inorganic&#8208;Oxide Fluorinations? A Fluorooxoborate Illustration under Terahertz Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
THz spectroscopy is used to show that fluorine atoms have a discernible preference for bonding with sp3&#8208;boron over sp2&#8208;boron in the fluorination reactions of boric acid. This result helps resolve the F/OH substitution structural ambiguity. A reaction pathway for fluorination via the hydrothermal and room&#8208;temperature evaporation reactions is presented which gives insights into previously obscured aspects of the borate&#8208;fluorination process.







Abstract
The substitution of fluorine atoms for oxygen atoms/hydroxyl groups has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the physical and chemical properties of oxides/hydroxides in fluorine chemistry. However, distinguishing fluorine from oxygen/hydroxyl in the reaction products poses a significant challenge in existing characterization methods. In this study, we illustrate that terahertz (THz) spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. To this end, we investigated two fluorination reactions of boric acid, utilizing MHF2 (M=Na, C(NH2)3) as fluorine reagents. Through an interplay between THz spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state density functional theory, we have conclusively demonstrated that fluorine atoms exclusively bind with the sp3&#8208;boron but not with the sp2&#8208;boron in the reaction products of Na[B(OH)3][B3O3F2(OH)2] (NaBOFH) and [C(NH2)3]2B3O3F4OH (GBF2). Based on this evidence, we have proposed a reaction pathway for the fluorinations under investigation, a process previously hindered due to structural ambiguity. This work represents a step forward in gaining a deeper understanding of the precise structures and reaction mechanisms involved in the fluorination of oxides/hydroxides, illuminated by the insights provided by THz spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;THz spectroscopy is used to show that fluorine atoms have a discernible preference for bonding with &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-boron over &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-boron in the fluorination reactions of boric acid. This result helps resolve the F/OH substitution structural ambiguity. A reaction pathway for fluorination via the hydrothermal and room-temperature evaporation reactions is presented which gives insights into previously obscured aspects of the borate-fluorination process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substitution of fluorine atoms for oxygen atoms/hydroxyl groups has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the physical and chemical properties of oxides/hydroxides in fluorine chemistry. However, distinguishing fluorine from oxygen/hydroxyl in the reaction products poses a significant challenge in existing characterization methods. In this study, we illustrate that terahertz (THz) spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. To this end, we investigated two fluorination reactions of boric acid, utilizing MHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Na, C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as fluorine reagents. Through an interplay between THz spectroscopy and solid-state density functional theory, we have conclusively demonstrated that fluorine atoms exclusively bind with the &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-boron but not with the &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-boron in the reaction products of Na[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (NaBOFH) and [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH (GBF2). Based on this evidence, we have proposed a reaction pathway for the fluorinations under investigation, a process previously hindered due to structural ambiguity. This work represents a step forward in gaining a deeper understanding of the precise structures and reaction mechanisms involved in the fluorination of oxides/hydroxides, illuminated by the insights provided by THz spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites Promote OH* Formation and Enhance Formate Selectivity: Towards High&#8208;efficiency Glycerol Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts could achieve low potential and high formate selectivity toward glycerol valorization, because the Lewis centers promote OH* formation and the Br&#248;nsted centers enhance selective oxidation of glycerol to formate. This study demonstrates the vital roles of solid&#8208;acid sites in improving the activity and product selectivity for electrocatalytic biomass upcycling.







Abstract
As a sustainable valorization route, electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) involves in formation of key OH* and selective adsorption/cleavage of C&#8722;C(O) intermediates with multi&#8208;step electron transfer, thus suffering from high potential and poor formate selectivity for most non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. So, it remains challenging to understand the structure&#8211;property relationship as well as construct synergistic sites to realize high&#8208;activity and high&#8208;selectivity GOR. Herein, we successfully achieve dual&#8208;high performance with low potentials and superior formate selectivity for GOR by forming synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in Ni&#8208;alloyed Co&#8208;based spinel. The optimized NiCo oxide solid&#8208;acid electrocatalyst exhibits low reaction potential (1.219&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA/cm2) and high formate selectivity (94.0&#8201;%) toward GOR. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pH&#8208;dependence measurements show that the Lewis acid centers could accelerate OH* production, while the Br&#248;nsted acid centers are proved to facilitate high&#8208;selectivity formation of formate. Theoretical calculations reveal that NiCo alloyed oxide shows appropriate d&#8208;band center, thus balancing adsorption/desorption of C&#8722;O intermediates. This study provides new insights into rationally designing solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts for biomass electro&#8208;upcycling.

         <title>Discovery of the First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Inhibitors of Hypoxia Up&#8208;Regulated Protein&#8197;1 (HYOU1) Suppressing Pathogenic Fibroblast Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidisciplinary pipeline consisting of medicinal chemistry, molecular phenotyping, chemoproteomics, RNA&#8208;sequencing, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)&#8208;mediated gene silencing and in vivo studies led to a novel series of compounds suppressing pathogenic fibroblast activation via Hypoxia up&#8208;regulated protein&#8197;1 (HYOU1) inhibition. The first reported HYOU1 inhibitors are presented as a promising therapeutic approach in fibroblast&#8208;related diseases.







Abstract
Fibroblasts are key regulators of inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer. Targeting their activation in these complex diseases has emerged as a novel strategy to restore tissue homeostasis. Here, we present a multidisciplinary lead discovery approach to identify and optimize small molecule inhibitors of pathogenic fibroblast activation. The study encompasses medicinal chemistry, molecular phenotyping assays, chemoproteomics, bulk RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis, target validation experiments, and chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET)/pharmacokinetic (PK)/in vivo evaluation. The parallel synthesis employed for the production of the new benzamide derivatives enabled us to a)&#8197;pinpoint key structural elements of the scaffold that provide potent fibroblast&#8208;deactivating effects in cells, b)&#8197;discriminate atoms or groups that favor or disfavor a desirable ADMET profile, and c)&#8197;identify metabolic &#8220;hot spots&#8221;. Furthermore, we report the discovery of the first&#8208;in&#8208;class inhibitor leads for hypoxia up&#8208;regulated protein&#8197;1 (HYOU1), a member of the heat shock protein&#8197;70 (HSP70) family often associated with cellular stress responses, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Targeting HYOU1 may therefore represent a potentially novel strategy to modulate fibroblast activation and treat chronic inflammatory and fibrotic disorders.

         <title>Reduction of Superoxide Radical Intermediate by Polydopamine for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine (PDA) containing pyrrole nitrogen atoms not only promotes charge separation but also serves as a &#8901;O2&#8722; adsorption reduction active site for efficient H2O2 production. In the absence of sacrificial reagents, the H2O2 yield of CN&#8208;PDA was 742.8&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1, 47&#8197;times higher than CN.







Abstract
The synthesis of hydrogen peroxide through artificial photosynthesis is a green and promising technology with advantages in sustainability, economy and safety. However, superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), an important intermediate in photocatalytic oxygen reduction to H2O2 production, has strong oxidizing properties that potentially destabilize the catalyst. Therefore, avoiding the accumulation of &#8901;O2&#8722; for its rapid conversion to H2O2 is of paramount significance in improving catalyst stability and H2O2 yield. In this work, a strategy was developed to utilize protonated groups for the rapid depletion of converted &#8901;O2&#8722;, thereby the efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 from CN was successfully enhanced by 47&#8208;fold. The experimental findings demonstrated that polydopamine not only improved carrier separation efficiency, and more importantly, provided the adsorption reduction active site for &#8901;O2&#8722; for efficient H2O2 production. This work offers a versatile approach for synthesizing efficient and stable photocatalysts.

         <title>Role of Surface Terminations for Charge Storage of Ti3C2Tx MXene Electrodes in Aqueous Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition from electrochemically inactive Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 to fast, pseudocapacitive behavior is reported for N,O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 MXene, attributed to the presence of confined water between the MXene layers. This study evidences the crucial role surface terminations and confined water in charge storage and reaction kinetics in MXene materials.







Abstract
In this study, we used 2&#8208;Dimmensionnal Ti3C2 MXene as model materials to understand how the surface groups affect their electrochemical performance. By adjusting the nature of the surface terminations (Cl&#8208;, N/O&#8208;, and O&#8208;) of Ti3C2 MXene through a molten salt approach, we could change the spacing between MXene layers and the level of water confinement, resulting in significant modifications of the electrochemical performance in acidic electrolyte. Using a combination of techniques including in&#8208;operando X&#8208;ray diffraction and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we found that the presence of confined water results in a drastic transition from an almost electrochemically inactive behavior for Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 to an ideally fast pseudocapacitive signature for N,O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 MXene. This experimental work not only demonstrates the strong connection between surface terminations and confined water but also reveals the importance of confined water on the charge storage mechanism and the reaction kinetics in MXene.

     alt="Role of Surface Terminations for Charge Storage of Ti3C2Tx MXene Electrodes in Aqueous Acidic Electrolyte"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transition from electrochemically inactive Cl-terminated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to fast, pseudocapacitive behavior is reported for N,O-terminated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MXene, attributed to the presence of confined water between the MXene layers. This study evidences the crucial role surface terminations and confined water in charge storage and reaction kinetics in MXene materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we used 2-Dimmensionnal Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MXene as model materials to understand how the surface groups affect their electrochemical performance. By adjusting the nature of the surface terminations (Cl-, N/O-, and O-) of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MXene through a molten salt approach, we could change the spacing between MXene layers and the level of water confinement, resulting in significant modifications of the electrochemical performance in acidic electrolyte. Using a combination of techniques including in-operando X-ray diffraction and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we found that the presence of confined water results in a drastic transition from an almost electrochemically inactive behavior for Cl-terminated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to an ideally fast pseudocapacitive signature for N,O-terminated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MXene. This experimental work not only demonstrates the strong connection between surface terminations and confined water but also reveals the importance of confined water on the charge storage mechanism and the reaction kinetics in MXene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terminal Copper Nitrenoid Formation and Reactivity Induced by Absorption to an Antenna Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper nitrenoids are key intermediates in copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H amination reactions but are difficult to study due to their high reactivity. This research shows that absorption to an antenna ligand can promote the denitrogenation of copper azide complexes in the gas phase and also channel the internal energy to promote the C&#8722;H amination reaction, which opens a new way to study the reactivity of highly reactive species under well&#8208;defined conditions.







Abstract
Copper nitrenoids are key intermediates in copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H amination reactions. Further development of this important reaction relies on knowing the properties and reactivity of the nitrenoid intermediates. This work utilizes antenna ligands to form copper nitrenoid complexes and monitor the consecutive C&#8722;H amination reactions under well&#8208;defined single&#8208;molecule conditions in the gas phase. The [Cu(Lphoto)(Lazide)]+ precursors (Lphoto is a bidentate antenna ligand, and Lazide is an organic azide) were stored in an ion trap at 3.5&#8197;K and irradiated by visible light, which resulted in denitrogenation of the complex. Further irradiation of the copper nitrenoid led to the consecutive C&#8722;H amination of the antenna ligand. The nitrenoid complexes, as well as the products of the C&#8722;H amination, were characterized by helium tagging IRPD spectroscopy, and the mechanism was described by DFT calculations. This research demonstrates that the antenna ligands can be used to promote the denitrogenation of metal azides in the gas phase and also channel the internal energy to promote further reactivity, which opens a new way to study the reactivity of highly reactive species under well&#8208;defined conditions.

         <title>Kinetics Controlled Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization control of perovskite thin films is the key in commerciallization of perovskite solar cells. However, the fast crystallization of the thin film including nucleation, growth and Oswald ripening, is still a mystery though some efforts made. According to the theories of nucleation and Oswald ripening, we modified the perovskite surface energy and improved the grain solubility, and quantified the nucleation and ripening rate in experiments. 







Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have recently developed rapidly compared to crystalline silicon solar cells. To have an effective way to control the crystallization of perovskite thin films is the key for achieving good device performance. However, a paradox in perovskite crystallization is from the mismatch between nucleation and Oswald ripening. Usually, the large numbers of nucleation sites tend to weak Oswald ripening. Here, we proposed a new mechanism to promote the formation of nucleation sites by reducing surface energy from 44.9&#8197;mN/m to 36.1&#8197;mN/m, to spontaneously accelerate the later Oswald ripening process by improving the grain solubility through the elastic modulus regulation. The ripening rate is increased from 2.37&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 to 4.61&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 during annealing. Finally, the solar cells derived from the optimized films showed significantly improved PCE from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;%. The long&#8208;term stability tests show excellent thermal stability (the optimized device without encapsulation maintaining 82&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 800&#8197;h aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C) and an improved light stability under illumination. This work provides a new method, the elastic modulus regulation, to enhance the ripening process.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fully Conjugated Dimerized Giant Acceptors with Different Alkyl&#8208;Linked Sites for Stable and 19.13&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new non&#8208;fully conjugated dimerized giant acceptors with different alkyl&#8208;linked sites are developed. Among them, wing&#8208;sited 2Y&#8208;wing has fine&#8208;tuned packing and better miscibility with donor, allowing to 19.13&#8201;% efficiency (which is the highest value among the devices with giant acceptors) and highly stable organic solar cells.







Abstract
Achieving both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device stability is a major challenge for the practical development of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three non&#8208;fully conjugated dimerized giant acceptors (named 2Y&#8208;sites, including wing&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;wing, core&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;core, and end&#8208;site&#8208;linked 2Y&#8208;end) are developed. They share the similar monomer precursors but have different alkyl&#8208;linked sites, offering the fine&#8208;tuned molecular absorption, packing, glass transition temperature, and carrier mobility. Among their binary active layers, D18/2Y&#8208;wing has better miscibility, leading to optimized morphology and more efficient charge transfer compared to D18/2Y&#8208;core and D18/2Y&#8208;end. Therefore, the D18/2Y&#8208;wing&#8208;based OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 17.73&#8201;%, attributed to enhanced photocurrent and fill factor. Furthermore, the D18/2Y&#8208;wing&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a balance of high PCE and improved stability, distinguishing them within the 2Y&#8208;sites. Building on the success of 2Y&#8208;wing in binary systems, we extend its application to ternary OSCs by pairing it with the near&#8208;infrared absorbing D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F host. Thanks to the complementary absorption within 300&#8211;970&#8197;nm and further optimized morphology, ternary OSCs obtain a higher PCE of 19.13&#8201;%, setting a new efficiency benchmark for the dimer&#8208;derived OSCs. This approach of alkyl&#8208;linked site engineering for constructing dimerized giant acceptors presents a promising pathway to improve both PCE and stability of OSCs.

         <title>Harnessing Catalytic RNA Circuits for Construction of Artificial Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes an amplifiable RNA circuit based on the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 function, which can directly build regulatory connections between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells. With this design, artificial signaling pathways can be introduced into mammalian cells to control cellular responses and phenotypes through differentiated RNA expression.







Abstract
Engineering of genetic networks with artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) can reprogram cellular responses and phenotypes under different circumstances for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, construction of ASPs between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells is highly challenging. Here we report an amplifiable RNA circuit that can theoretically build regulatory connections between any endogenous genes in mammalian cells. We harness the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 function to transduce the signals from distinct messenger RNA expression of trigger genes into manipulation of target genes. Through introduction of these RNA&#8208;based genetic circuits, mammalian cells are endowed with autonomous capabilities to sense the changes of RNA expression either induced by ligand stimuli or from various cell types and control the cellular responses and fates via apoptosis&#8208;related ASPs. Our design provides a generalized platform for construction of ASPs inside the genetic networks of mammalian cells based on differentiated RNA expression.

&lt;p&gt;Engineering of genetic networks with &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;rtificial &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;ignaling &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;athways (ASPs) can reprogram cellular responses and phenotypes under different circumstances for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, construction of ASPs between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells is highly challenging. Here we report an amplifiable RNA circuit that can theoretically build regulatory connections between any endogenous genes in mammalian cells. We harness the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR-Cas9 function to transduce the signals from distinct messenger RNA expression of trigger genes into manipulation of target genes. Through introduction of these RNA-based genetic circuits, mammalian cells are endowed with autonomous capabilities to sense the changes of RNA expression either induced by ligand stimuli or from various cell types and control the cellular responses and fates via apoptosis-related ASPs. Our design provides a generalized platform for construction of ASPs inside the genetic networks of mammalian cells based on differentiated RNA expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Disassembly of Molecular Motor&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers Revealed by High&#8208;Speed AFM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic light&#8208;triggered depolymerisation of chiral molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymers has been observed in real time with High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM). These results show the depolymerisation selectively from the polymer ends through a cooperative process.







Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers have a major potential for applications in responsive materials that are externally triggered by light with spatio&#8208;temporal control of their polymerisation state. While changes in macroscopic properties revealed the adaptive nature of these materials, it remains challenging to capture the dynamic depolymerisation process at the molecular level, which requires fast observation techniques combined with in situ irradiation. By implementing in situ UV illumination into a High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscope (HS&#8208;AFM) setup, we have been able to capture the disassembly of a light&#8208;driven molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymer. The real&#8208;time visualisation of the light&#8208;triggered disassembly process not only reveals cooperative depolymerisation, it also shows that this process continues after illumination is halted. Combining the data with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and spectroscopy approaches, we obtain a molecular&#8208;level description of the motor&#8208;based polymer dynamics reminiscent of actin chain&#8208;end depolymerisation. Our detailed understanding of supramolecular depolymerisation will drive the development of future responsive polymer systems.

         <title>Simple Functionalization of a Donor Monomer to Enhance Charge Transfer in Porous Polymer Networks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazatruxene (TAT)&#8208;based PPNs were synthesized to investigate how the existence of a hexyl functional group would affect charge transfer. The hexyl group on the TAT unit ensured the transfer of photoexcited electrons from a donor unit to an acceptor unit, resulting in improved photocatalytic activity and hydrogen production.







Abstract
Porous polymer networks (PPNs) are promising candidates as photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor structure is known to be an effective approach for improving photocatalytic activity. However, the process of how a functional group of a monomer can ensure photoexcited charges transfer and improve the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) has not yet been studied on the molecular level. Herein, we design and synthesize two kinds of triazatruxene (TAT)&#8208;based PPNs: TATR&#8208;PPN with a hexyl (R) group and TAT&#8208;PPN without the hexyl group, to understand the relationship between the presence of the functional group and charge transfer. The hexyl group on the TAT unit was found to ensure the transfer of photoexcited electrons from a donor unit to an acceptor unit and endowed the TATR&#8208;PPN with stable hydrogen production.

         <title>Making Plasticized Polymer Electrolytes Stable Against Sodium Metal for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new plasticized polymer electrolyte integrated with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive was reported to address the interface instability issue existing in sodium metal batteries. Impressively, dome&#8208;like Na0 nucleation/growth with thin, amorphous, and fluoride&#8208;rich SEIs was identified, enabling excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability in Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 pouch cells (93.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3) at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes based on plastic crystals are promising for solid&#8208;state sodium metal (Na0) batteries, yet their practicality has been hindered by the notorious Na0&#8208;electrolyte interface instability issue, the underlying cause of which remains poorly understood. Here, by leveraging a model plasticized polymer electrolyte based on conventional succinonitrile plastic crystals, we uncover its failure origin in Na0 batteries is associated with the formation of a thick and non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and whiskery Na0 nucleation/growth. Furthermore, we design a new additive&#8208;embedded plasticized polymer electrolyte to manipulate the Na0 deposition and SEI formulation. For the first time, we demonstrate that introducing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive into the succinonitrile&#8208;plasticized polymer electrolyte can effectively protect Na0 against interfacial corrosion by facilitating the growth of dome&#8208;like Na0 with thin, amorphous, and fluorine&#8208;rich SEIs, thus enabling significantly improved performances of Na//Na symmetric cells (1,800&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells (93.0&#8201;% capacity retention after 1,200 cycles at 1&#8197;C rate in coin cells and 93.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3 in pouch cells at room temperature). Our work provides valuable insights into the interfacial failure of plasticized polymer electrolytes and offers a promising solution to resolving the interfacial instability issue.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Covalent Organic Framework in the Presence of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;containing&#8208;species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2 was proposed. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from the oxygen reduction reaction could decrease the energy barrier for the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center and thus boost the CO2RR performance.







Abstract
Herein, we propose an oxygen&#8208;containing species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2. A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF), denoted as NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that is composed of the Ni&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) unit with well&#8208;defined Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites and the salen(Co)2 moiety with binuclear Co&#8722;N2O2 sites, is developed and synthesized for enhancing the CO2RR under aerobic condition. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from ORR could decrease the energy barrier of the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center. Besides, the oxygen species axially coordinated Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites can favor in reducing the energy barrier of the intermediate *COOH formation for the CO2RR. Thus, NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF exhibits high oxygen&#8208;tolerant CO2RR performance and achieves outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO partial current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V in the presence of 0.5&#8201;% O2, which is superior to that in pure CO2 feed gas (FECO=94.8&#8201;%, jCO=19.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Notably, the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF achieves an industrial&#8208;level current density of 128.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow&#8208;cell reactor with 0.5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V, which is higher than that in pure CO2 atmosphere (jCO=104.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). It is worth noting that an excellent FECO of 86.8&#8201;% is still achieved in the presence of 5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V. This work provides an effective strategy to enable the CO2RR under O2 atmosphere by utilizing the *OOH intermediates of ORR to boost CO2 electroreduction.

Thus, NiPc-Salen(Co)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-COF exhibits high oxygen-tolerant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance and achieves outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO partial current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V in the presence of 0.5&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is superior to that in pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feed gas (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=94.8&#8201;%, &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=19.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Notably, the NiPc-Salen(Co)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-COF achieves an industrial-level current density of 128.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the flow-cell reactor with 0.5&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V, which is higher than that in pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere (&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=104.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is worth noting that an excellent FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of 86.8&#8201;% is still achieved in the presence of 5&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V. This work provides an effective strategy to enable the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR under O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere by utilizing the *OOH intermediates of ORR to boost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Regulated Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species from Porphyrin&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages for Selective Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metallacage exhibited strong host&#8208;guest interactions with fullerene derivatives. The complexes could be dissembled by the further addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine to form a more stable coordinated complex. This tunable host&#8208;guest complexation was further employed to generate different types of reactive oxygen species, enabling the highly efficient and selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols.







Abstract
The development of novel materials for highly efficient and selective photocatalysis is crucial for their practical applications. Herein, we employ the host&#8208;guest chemistry of porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species and further use them for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols. Upon irradiation, the sole metallacage (6) can generate singlet oxygen (1O2) effectively via excited energy transfer, while its complex with C70 (6&#8835;C70) opens a pathway for electron transfer to promote the formation of superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;), producing both 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. The addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (BPY) to complex 6&#8835;C70 forms a more stable complex (6&#8835;BPY) via the coordination of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin faces of 6 and BPY, which drives fullerenes out of the cavities and restores the ability of 1O2 generation. Therefore, benzyl alcohols are oxidized into benzyl aldehydes upon irradiation in the presence of 6 or 6&#8835;BPY, while they are oxidized into benzoic acids when 6&#8835;C70 is employed as the photosensitizing agent. This study demonstrates a highly efficient strategy that utilizes the host&#8208;guest chemistry of metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species for selective photooxidation reactions, which could promote the utilization of metallacages and their related host&#8208;guest complexes for photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Stilbene Pairs in a DNA Duplex Mediated by Ruthenium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to site&#8208;specifically crosslink DNA duplex upon visible light irradiation. Ru complex on the third strand catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site specificity is realized owing to steep distance dependence of the energy transfer. This method will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.







Abstract
We herein report a method for site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of a DNA duplex. A stilbene pair was introduced into a DNA duplex and a ruthenium complex was conjugated with a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide. We demonstrated that [2+2] photocycloaddition of the stilbene pair occurred upon irradiation with visible light when the ruthenium complex was in close proximity due to triplex formation. No reaction occurred when the ruthenium complex was not in proximity to the stilbene pair. The wavelength of visible light used was of lower energy than the wavelength of UV light necessary for direct excitation of stilbene. Quantum chemical calculation indicated that ruthenium complex catalyzed the photocycloaddition via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site selectivity of this photo&#8208;crosslinking system was evaluated using a DNA duplex bearing two stilbene pairs as a substrate; we showed that the site of crosslinking was precisely regulated by the sequence of the oligonucleotide linked to the ruthenium complex. Since this method does not require orthogonal photoresponsive molecules, it will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric with Afterglow Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enable a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature (&#916;TC=114.4&#8197;K), but also realize the first integration of notable ferroelectricity and long afterglow emission in (4&#8208;methylpiperidium)CdCl3 with one&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite architecture.







Abstract
Luminescent ferroelectrics are holding exciting prospect for integrated photoelectronic devices due to potential light&#8208;polarization interactions at electron scale. Integrating ferroelectricity and long&#8208;lived afterglow emission in a single material would offer new possibilities for fundamental research and applications, however, related reports have been a blank to date. For the first time, we here achieved the combination of notable ferroelectricity and afterglow emission in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material. Remarkably, the presented (4&#8208;methylpiperidium)CdCl3 also shows noticeable antiferroelectric behavior. The implementation of cationic customization and halogen engineering not only enables a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 114.4&#8197;K but also brings a record longest emission lifetime up to 117.11&#8197;ms under ambient conditions, realizing a leapfrog improvement of at least two orders of magnitude compared to reported hybrid ferroelectrics so far. This finding would herald the emergence of novel application potential, such as multi&#8208;level density data storage or multifunctional sensors, towards the future integrated optoelectronic devices with multitasking capabilities.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation and Transfer Hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Nitrones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reduction of 1,3&#8208;dipolar nitrones to hydroxylamines was achieved by Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation. A wide range of chiral N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydroxylamines were synthesized with up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were conducted to elucidate the origin of reactivity and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Owing to their distinctive 1,3&#8208;dipolar structure, the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of nitrones to hydroxylamines has been a formidable and longstanding challenge, characterized by intricate enantiocontrol and susceptibility to N&#8722;O bond cleavage. In this study, the asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of nitrones were accomplished with a tethered TsDPEN&#8208;derived cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) catalyst (TsDPEN: p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), the reaction proceeds via a novel 7&#8208;membered cyclic transition state, producing chiral hydroxylamines with up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. The practical viability of this methodology was underscored by gram&#8208;scale catalytic reactions and subsequent transformations. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were also conducted to elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Owing to their distinctive 1,3-dipolar structure, the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of nitrones to hydroxylamines has been a formidable and longstanding challenge, characterized by intricate enantiocontrol and susceptibility to N&#8722;O bond cleavage. In this study, the asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of nitrones were accomplished with a tethered TsDPEN-derived cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) catalyst (TsDPEN: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluenesulfonyl-1,2-diphenylethylene-1,2-diamine), the reaction proceeds via a novel 7-membered cyclic transition state, producing chiral hydroxylamines with up to 99&#8201;% yield and &amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee. The practical viability of this methodology was underscored by gram-scale catalytic reactions and subsequent transformations. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were also conducted to elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Iron Homeostasis: Iron Capturing Nanocomposites for Combating Bacterial Biofilm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>

Bacteria spend years in a dormant, inactive state, yet revive in some nutrient environments. Iron nutritional immunity strategy was proposed to target iron nutrients. We developed a nanoplatform that can deceive bacteria to uptake &#8220;fake iron&#8221; and concurrently extract iron ions from the surrounding bacteria milieu, starving pathogens to death.







Abstract
Given the scarcity of novel antibiotics, the eradication of bacterial biofilm infections poses formidable challenges. Upon bacterial infection, the host restricts Fe ions, which are crucial for bacterial growth and maintenance. Having coevolved with the host, bacteria developed adaptive pathways like the hemin&#8208;uptake system to avoid iron deficiency. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy, termed iron nutritional immunity therapy (INIT), utilizing Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites constructed with gallium, copper&#8208;doped tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) metal&#8211;organic framework, and polyamine&#8208;amine polymer dots, to target bacterial iron intakes and starve them. Owing to the similarity between iron/hemin and gallium/TCPP, gallium&#8208;incorporated porphyrin potentially deceives bacteria into uptaking gallium ions and concurrently extracts iron ions from the surrounding bacteria milieu through the porphyrin ring. This strategy orchestrates a &#8220;give and take&#8221; approach for Ga3+/Fe3+ exchange. Simultaneously, polymer dots can impede bacterial iron metabolism and serve as real&#8208;time fluorescent iron&#8208;sensing probes to continuously monitor dynamic iron restriction status. INIT based on Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites induced long&#8208;term iron starvation, which affected iron&#8208;sulfur cluster biogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism, ultimately facilitating biofilm eradication and tissue regeneration. Therefore, this study presents an innovative antibacterial strategy from a nutritional perspective that sheds light on refractory bacterial infection treatment and its future clinical application.

A rapid functional group transformation method that converts metabolic carboxylic acids into a new ketone within 10 minutes using the reagent 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine (the bait for the fish) has been developed by Daniel Globisch et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202318579). The newly formed ketone was then captured by the chemical probe methodology Quant&#8208;SCHEMA (the fishing device) for quantification of all carboxylic acids even at very low quantities (depth of the ocean). This bifunctional methodology represents a new chemical biology tool for biomarker discovery and metabolomics.

The nature of adsorbed oxygen species determines the product selectivity in the oxidative coupling of CH4 as shown on the cover. In their Communication (e202319192), Guiyuan Jiang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko et&#8197;al. describe how the formation of carbon oxides and ethane correlates with the binding strength of selective mono&#8208;atomic oxygen species. The strength affects the probability of their recombination to diatomic oxygen species oxidizing methane to carbon oxides. Cover image credit: Vita A. Kondratenko.

Site&#8208;selective photocrosslinking of DNA duplex was achieved in the Research Article (e202319516) by Hiromu Kashida, Hiroyuki Asanuma et&#8197;al. A ruthenium complex on a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide effectively catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties in a DNA duplex under visible light. Since the reaction proceeds via triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer, the reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Site-selective photocrosslinking&lt;/b&gt; of DNA duplex was achieved in the Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202319516"&gt;(e202319516)&lt;/a&gt; by Hiromu Kashida, Hiroyuki Asanuma et&#8197;al. A ruthenium complex on a triplex-forming oligonucleotide effectively catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties in a DNA duplex under visible light. Since the reaction proceeds via triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer, the reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Radiochemistry with Fluorine&#8208;18, Carbon&#8208;11&#8201;and Zirconium&#8208;89</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent developments in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry, focusing on key isotopes (fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, zirconium&#8208;89) in positron emission tomography (PET). These technologies have been used to radiolabel small molecules, peptides and larger biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies.







Abstract
This review discusses recent advances in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry for three key isotopes: fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, and zirconium&#8208;89, and their applications in positron emission tomography (PET). In the case of fluorine&#8208;18, the predominant approach involves the use of cyclotron&#8208;produced [18F]fluoride or reagents derived thereof. Light serves to activate either the substrate or the fluorine&#8208;18 labeled reagent. Advancements in carbon&#8208;11 photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry have been leveraged for the radiolabeling of small molecules, achieving various transformations, including 11C&#8208;methylation, 11C&#8208;carboxylation, 11C&#8208;carbonylation, and 11C&#8208;cyanation. Contrastingly, zirconium&#8208;89 photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry differs from fluorine&#8208;18 and carbon&#8208;11 approaches. In these cases, light facilitates a postlabeling click reaction, which has proven valuable for the labeling of large biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). New technological developments, such as the incorporation of photoreactors in commercial radiosynthesizers, illustrate the commitment the field is making in embracing photochemistry. Taken together, these advances in photo&#8208;mediated radiochemistry enable radiochemists to apply new retrosynthetic strategies in accessing novel PET radiotracers.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Functionalization of Bicycloalkanes, Cubanes and Related Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review aims to provide an overview on the recent photochemical strategies for the construction and/or functionalization of bicycloalkanes, cubanes, and some of their heterocyclic structural analogues. The synthetic methods have been organized according to the molecular target, and with a particular emphasis on the type of photochemical mechanisms involved. Future perspectives and open synthetic challenges within the field are presented.







Abstract
Bicycloalkanes, cubanes and their structural analogues have emerged as bioisosteres of (hetero)arenes. To meet increasing demand, the chemical community has developed a plethora of novel synthetic methods. In this review, we assess the progress made in the field of light&#8208;driven construction and functionalization of such relevant molecules. We have focused on diverse structural targets, as well as on reaction processes giving access to: (i) [1.1.1]&#8208;bicyclopentanes (BCPs); (ii) [2.2.1]&#8208;bicyclohexanes (BCHs); (iii) [3.1.1]&#8208;bicycloheptanes (BCHeps); and (iv) cubanes; as well as other structurally related scaffolds. Finally, future perspectives dealing with the identification of novel reaction manifolds to access new functionalized bioisosteric units are discussed.

         <title>Intermediates in Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Minireview we present and discussed a series of examples from various areas in which reactive intermediates have been detected during mechanochemical reactions. Understanding the factors behind the formation and stabilization of these intermediates could enhance mechanochemical methods and chemical reaction development.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions offer methodological and environmental advantages for chemical synthesis, constantly attracting attention within the scientific community. Besides unmistakable sustainability advantages, the conditions under which mechanochemical reactions occur, namely solventless conditions, sometimes facilitate the isolation of otherwise labile or inaccessible products. Despite these advantages, limited knowledge exists regarding the mechanisms of these reactions and the types of intermediates involved. Nevertheless, in an expanding number of cases, ex situ and in situ monitoring techniques have allowed for the observation, characterization, and isolation of reaction intermediates in mechanochemical transformations. In this Minireview, we present a series of examples in which reactive intermediates have been detected in mechanochemical reactions spanning organic, organometallic, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Many of these intermediates were stabilized by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which played a pivotal role in guiding the chemical transformations. We believe that by uncovering and understanding such instances, the growing mechanochemistry community could find novel opportunities in catalysis and discover new mechanochemical reactions while achieving simplification in chemical reaction design.

         <title>Artificial Homeostasis Systems Based on Feedback Reaction Networks: Design Principles and Future Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review shows how to design feedback&#8208;controlled reaction networks in different molecular systems that have a range of non&#8208;linear functions. These networks are a useful set of tools for creating chemical systems and materials that are interactive and have homeostasis&#8208;like animate features. These discoveries pave the way for the development of forthcoming next&#8208;generation systems and materials.







Abstract
Feedback&#8208;controlled chemical reaction networks (FCRNs) are indispensable for various biological processes, such as cellular mechanisms, patterns, and signaling pathways. Through the intricate interplay of many feedback loops (FLs), FCRNs maintain a stable internal cellular environment. Currently, creating minimalistic synthetic cells is the long&#8208;term objective of systems chemistry, which is motivated by such natural integrity. The design, kinetic optimization, and analysis of FCRNs to exhibit functions akin to those of a cell still pose significant challenges. Indeed, reaching synthetic homeostasis is essential for engineering synthetic cell components. However, maintaining homeostasis in artificial systems against various agitations is a difficult task. Several biological events can provide us with guidelines for a conceptual understanding of homeostasis, which can be further applicable in designing artificial synthetic systems. In this regard, we organize our review with artificial homeostasis systems driven by FCRNs at different length scales, including homogeneous, compartmentalized, and soft material systems. First, we stretch a quick overview of FCRNs in different molecular and supramolecular systems, which are the essential toolbox for engineering different nonlinear functions and homeostatic systems. Moreover, the existing history of synthetic homeostasis in chemical and material systems and their advanced functions with self&#8208;correcting, and regulating properties are also emphasized.

         <title>Designing Multifunctional Biomaterials via Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview sums up cutting&#8208;edge concepts regarding the formation of protein&#8208;based supramolecular structures, compartmentalization, and self&#8208;assembly monitoring; it compares the routes of their modifications and applications in multifunctional biomaterial design. We summarize the current knowledge about machine learning/artificial intelligence applications for protein structure prediction/obtainment and link it to biomaterial performance.







Abstract
Protein self&#8208;assembly is a fundamental biological process where proteins spontaneously organize into complex and functional structures without external direction. This process is crucial for the formation of various biological functionalities. However, when protein self&#8208;assembly fails, it can trigger the development of multiple disorders, thus making understanding this phenomenon extremely important. Up until recently, protein self&#8208;assembly has been solely linked either to biological function or malfunction; however, in the past decade or two it has also been found to hold promising potential as an alternative route for fabricating materials for biomedical applications. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the key aspects of protein self&#8208;assembly: how the protein structure and self&#8208;assembly conditions (chemical environments, kinetics, and the physicochemical characteristics of protein complexes) can be utilized to design biomaterials. This minireview focuses on the basic concepts of forming supramolecular structures, and the existing routes for modifications. We then compare the applicability of different approaches, including compartmentalization and self&#8208;assembly monitoring. Finally, based on the cutting&#8208;edge progress made during the last years, we summarize the current knowledge about tailoring a final function by introducing changes in self&#8208;assembly and link it to biomaterials&#8217; performance.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Aminoarylation of Butadienes via Photoinduced Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing readily available and cost&#8208;effective aryl halides, amines, and butadienes as starting materials, in conjunction with rac&#8208;BINAP and a Pd catalyst, we can efficiently synthesize highly valuable complex allylamines through a rapid one&#8208;step process enabled by photocatalysis.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, three&#8208;component palladium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aminoarylation of butadienes with readily available aryl halides and aliphatic amines has been developed, affording allylamines with excellent E&#8208;selectivity. The reaction exhibits exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group compatibility, as demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations are consistent with a photoinduced radical Pd(0)&#8208;Pd(I)&#8208;Pd(II)&#8208;Pd(0) Heck&#8208;Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation cascade.

         <title>Foldaxane&#8208;Based Switchable [c2]Daisy Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic helical foldamer linked to a peptide rod, which is incapable of self&#8208;complexation or polymerization, has been shown to preferentially assemble through inter&#8208;strand hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions into a [c2]daisy chain that undergoes fast contraction/stretching muscle&#8208;like motion without dissociation. The introduction of multiple recognition sites confers the system with contraction and stretching motion actuated by chemical stimuli.







Abstract
Artificial molecular muscles are highly attractive in the field of molecular machinery due to their unique properties of contraction and stretching motion. However, the synthesis of molecular muscles poses formidable challenges as it is hindered by undesirable yields and poor selectivity. Herein, we present a procedure for the dynamic assembly of foldaxane&#8208;based [c2]daisy chains, wherein the hermaphroditic sequences consisting of aromatic helices and peptide rods are interlocked through inter&#8208;strand hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The binding complementarity facilitates a selective and efficient assembly of [c2]daisy chain structures, inhibiting the creation of by&#8208;products. Introducing multiple recognition sites confers the system with contraction and stretching motion actuated by chemical stimuli. The rate of this muscle&#8208;like motion is calculated to be 0.8&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is 107&#8197;times faster than that of complex dissociation.

         <title>Sortase&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Domain Inversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to mimic the conventional N&#8208;terminal sortase substrate at protein C&#8208;termini is reported, enabling C&#8208; to C&#8208;terminal ligation. Installing this mimetic at the C&#8208;terminus of a protein with an internal sortase recognition motif enables sortase&#8208;catalyzed inversion of the C&#8208;terminal portion of the protein.







Abstract
Topological transformations and permutations of proteins have attracted significant interest as strategies to generate new protein functionalities or stability. These efforts have mainly been inspired by naturally occurring post&#8208;translational modifications, such as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization, circular permutation, or lasso&#8208;like entanglement. Such approaches can be realized experimentally via genetic encoding, in the case of circular permutation, or via enzymatic processing, in the case of cyclization. Notably, these previously described strategies leave the polypeptide backbone orientation unaltered. Here we describe an unnatural protein permutation, the protein domain inversion, whereby a C&#8208;terminal portion of a protein is enzymatically inverted from the canonical N&#8208;to&#8208;C to a C&#8208;to&#8208;C configuration with respect to the N&#8208;terminal part of the protein. The closest conceptually analogous biological process is perhaps the inversion of DNA segments as catalyzed by recombinases. We achieve these inversions using an engineered sortase A, a widely used transpeptidase. Our reactions proceed efficiently under mild conditions at 4&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and are compatible with entirely heterologously&#8208;produced protein substrates.

         <title>A New Architecture for DNA&#8208;Templated Synthesis in Which Abasic Sites Protect Reactants from Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abasic site within a DNA duplex reduces hydrolysis of a colocalised DNA&#8208;thioester. This forms the basis for an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis which protects DNA&#8208;tagged building blocks until a DNA strand exchange reaction removes the protective site and colocalizes a second reactive group.







Abstract
The synthesis of artificial sequence&#8208;defined polymers that match and extend the functionality of proteins is an important goal in materials science. One way of achieving this is to program a sequence of chemical reactions between precursor building blocks by means of attached oligonucleotide adapters. However, hydrolysis of the reactive building blocks has so far limited the length and yield of product that can be obtained using DNA&#8208;templated reactions. Here, we report an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in which reactants are tethered at internal abasic sites on opposite strands of a DNA duplex. We show that an abasic site within a DNA duplex can protect a nearby thioester from degradation, significantly increasing the yield of a DNA&#8208;templated reaction. This protective effect has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with programmable, sequence&#8208;controlled synthesis of long non&#8208;natural polymers by extending the lifetime of the reactive building blocks.

         <title>Tertiary Amides as Directing Groups for Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination using Ion&#8208;Paired Rhodium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct amination of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds generates important stereocenters. Our approach, in which the chirality of a bimetallic rhodium complex is located on its associated cations, achieves this on tertiary amide&#8208;containing substrates to give amination of arylbutyric and arylvaleric acid&#8208;derived amides. We believe that the amide most likely interacts directly with the chiral cation to provide a highly organised transition state for C&#8722;H amination.







Abstract
Enantioselective C&#8722;H amination at a benzylic methylene is a vital disconnection towards chiral benzylamines. Here we disclose that butyric and valeric acid&#8208;derived tertiary amides can undergo highly enantioselective benzylic amination using an achiral anionic Rh complex that is ion&#8208;paired with a Cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived chiral cation. A broad scope of compounds can be aminated encompassing numerous arene substitutions, amides, and two different chain lengths. Excellent tolerance of ortho substituents was observed, which has not been achieved before in asymmetric intermolecular C&#8722;H amination with Rh. We speculate that the tertiary amide group of the substrate engages in hydrogen bonding interactions directly with the chiral cation, enabling a high level of organisation at the transition state for C&#8722;H amination. This is in contrast with our previous work where a substrate bearing a hydrogen bond donor was required. Control experiments led to the discovery that methyl ethers also function as proficient directing groups under the optimised conditions, potentially also acting as hydrogen bond acceptors. This finding has the promise to dramatically expand the applicability of our ion&#8208;paired chiral catalysts.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Radical Cascade to a Chiral Saddle&#8208;Shaped Peropyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Undesired reaction pathways of open&#8208;shell graphene fragments can be synthetically useful! To demonstrate their transformative potential, we employed oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene&#8212;the well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;radical &#8220;decomposition&#8221; process&#8212;to build up strain and access negatively curved and configurationally stable chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.







Abstract
Reactions of open&#8208;shell molecular graphene fragments are typically thought of as undesired decomposition processes because they lead to the loss of desired features like &#960;&#8208;magnetism. Oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene shows, however, that these transformations hold promise as a synthetic tool for making complex structures via formation of multiple bonds and rings in a single step. Here, we explore the feasibility of using this &#8220;undesired&#8221; reaction of phenalenyl to build up strain and provide access to non&#8208;planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To this end, we designed and synthesized a biradical system with two phenalenyl units linked via a biphenylene backbone. The design facilitates an intramolecular cascade reaction to a helically twisted saddle&#8208;shaped product, where the key transformations&#8212;ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;fusion&#8212;occur within one reaction. The negative curvature of the final peropyrene product, induced by the formed eight&#8208;membered ring, was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the helical twist was validated via resolution of the product's enantiomers that display circularly polarized luminescence and high configurational stability.

         <title>Rapid and Bifunctional Chemoselective Metabolome Analysis of Liver Disease Plasma Using the Reagent 4&#8208;Nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid functional group transformation of carboxylic acids into a new ketone under mild conditions using the reagent 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine. The newly formed ketone was captured by our chemical probe methodology for quantification with enhanced mass spectrometric sensitivity. This bifunctional methodology is a new chemical biology tool for biomarker discovery and metabolomics.







Abstract
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that has been associated with diverse metabolic carboxylic acids. Mass spectrometric techniques are the method of choice for their analysis. However, the broad investigation of this metabolite class remains challenging. Derivatization of carboxylic acids represents a strategy to overcome these limitations but available methods suffer from diverse analytical challenges. Herein, we have designed a novel strategy introducing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine as a new chemoselective moiety for the first time for carboxylic acid metabolites. This moiety was selected as it rapidly forms a stable amide bond and also generates a new ketone, which can be analyzed by our recently developed quant&#8208;SCHEMA method specific for carbonyl metabolites. Optimization of this new method revealed a high reproducibility and robustness, which was utilized to validate 102&#8197;metabolic carboxylic acids using authentic synthetic standard conjugates in human plasma samples including nine metabolites that were newly detected. Using this sequential analysis of the carbonyl&#8208; and carboxylic acid&#8208;metabolomes revealed alterations of the ketogenesis pathway, which demonstrates the vast benefit of our unique methodology. We anticipate that the developed azirine moiety with rapid functional group transformation will find broad application in diverse chemical biology research fields.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Ruthenium(BINAP)(PPh3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a Ru(0)(BINAP)(PPh3) complex (BINAP:2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl) is reported. It behaves as a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16&#8208;electron Ru(0) complex: while being quite stable, it is capable to substitute PPh3 with alkenes/dienes, and activate C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H or inert N&#8722;Et bonds. This compound gives novel insight into Ru(0) stabilization approaches while maintaining a high specific reactivity potentially useful for catalytic applications.







Abstract
Ru(BINAP)(PPh3)HCl cleanly reacts with LiCH2TMS to give Ru(BINAP)(PPh3) (1) that has been fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction (BINAP and TMS stand for (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl and trimethylsilyl respectively). In sharp contrast with other carbonyl&#8208;free phosphine complexes of Ru(0), 1 demonstrates a strikingly high thermal stability and no propensity for intramolecular C&#8722;H activation (cyclometalation). Yet 1 coordinates acetonitrile and readily exchanges its PPh3 ligand with alkenes and dienes, thus behaving like a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16&#8208;e Ru(0) species. Electron&#8208;poor alkenes coordinate more readily than electron&#8208;rich ones, which testifies for the nucleophilic character of the Ru(0)&#8208;BINAP fragment. While being thermally stable, 1 is highly reactive and is capable of activating C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds, and even of cleaving an inert N&#8722;Et bond. The combination of high reactivity and stability originates from the P,arene&#8208;chelation by the BINAP ligand, i.e., the coordinated &#960;&#8208;arene stabilizes Ru(0) to prevent cyclometalation, yet it can slide upon substrate coordination, thereby enabling a variety of inert bond activation reactions to occur under mild conditions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high potential energy of aryne intermediates can induce reactions that proceed through unorthodox mechanisms. Herein we report the aryne&#8208;promoted formation of various helical dibenzochalcophenes from phosphine chalcogenides. Based on DFT computations we propose a mechanism to account for the final C&#8722;C bond formation that involves a rare, concerted ligand&#8208;coupling event within a hypervalent &#963;&#8208;phosphorane.







Abstract
Arynes are fleeting, high&#8208;energy intermediates that undergo myriad trapping reactions by nucleophiles. Their unusual reactivity compared to other electrophiles can spur unexpected mechanistic pathways enroute to the formation of benzenoid products. Herein we explore a particularly unique case of thermally generated arynes reacting with phosphoranes to form helical dibenzothiophenes and &#8208;selenophenes. Multiple new helical polycyclic aromatic products are reported. DP4+ and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis were used in tandem to confirm the structural topologies of selected products and to demonstrate the utility of DP4+ for distinguishing between isomeric polycyclic aromatic compounds. Lastly, we discuss a plausible mechanism consistent with DFT computations that accounts for the product formation; namely, ligand coupling (i.e., reductive elimination) within a hypervalent, pentacarbon&#8208;ligated &#963;&#8208;phosphorane furnishes the dibenzothio&#8208; or dibenzoselenophene.

         <title>Fundamentals of Unanticipated Efficiency of Gd2O3&#8208;based Catalysts in Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic tests combined with temporal analysis of products revealed the fundamentals relevant for regulating the efficiency of the oxidative coupling of CH4 to C2H6 over Gd&#8208;based catalysts. When Gd2O3 is modified with Na, Sr or Ba, the use of N2O instead of O2 significantly improves the selectivity even at 650&#8201;&#176;C. The promoters affect the binding strength of monoatomic oxygen species derived from N2O and thus control the methane oxidation to carbon oxides.







Abstract
Improving the selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane/ethylene poses a significant challenge for commercialization. The required improvements are hampered by the uncertainties associated with the reaction mechanism due to its complexity. Herein, we report about 90&#8201;% selectivity to the target products at 11&#8201;% methane conversion over Gd2O3&#8208;based catalysts at 700&#8201;&#176;C using N2O as the oxidant. Sophisticated kinetic studies have suggested the nature of adsorbed oxygen species and their binding strength as key parameters for undesired methane oxidation to carbon oxides. These descriptors can be controlled by a metal oxide promoter for Gd2O3.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Controlled Synthesis of Oriented Quasi&#8208;Spherical CsPbBr3 Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven approach is employed to achieve the controlled synthesis of four types of CsPbBr3 crystals and successfully control the orientation of quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 structures. Synthesis parameters are optimized using high&#8208;throughput characterization combined with machine learning. Furthermore, the synthetic mechanism is determined. Oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, screened by using the data&#8208;driven approach, exhibit significantly improved optical properties.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of lead&#8208;halide perovskite crystals is challenging yet attractive because of the pivotal role played by the crystal structure and growth conditions in regulating their properties. This study introduces data&#8208;driven strategies for the controlled synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, alongside an investigation into the synthesis mechanism. High&#8208;throughput rapid characterization of absorption spectra and color under ultraviolet illumination was conducted using 23 possible ligands for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 crystals. The links between the absorption spectra slope (difference in the absorbance at 400&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm divided by a wavelength interval of 50&#8197;nm) and crystal size were determined through statistical analysis of more than 100 related publications. Big data analysis and machine learning were employed to investigate a total of 688 absorption spectra and 652 color values, revealing correlations between synthesis parameters and properties. Ex situ characterization confirmed successful synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 perovskites using polyvinylpyrrolidone and Acacia. Density functional theory calculations highlighted strong adsorption of Acacia on the (110) facet of CsPbBr3. Optical properties of the oriented quasi&#8208;spherical perovskites prepared with these data&#8208;driven strategies were significantly improved. This study demonstrates that data&#8208;driven controlled synthesis facilitates morphology&#8208;controlled perovskites with excellent optical properties.

         <title>Deoxygenative Coupling of CO with a Tetrametallic Magnesium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of CO to a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster results in both carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation and deoxygenation to generate an acetaldehyde enolate [C2OH3]&#8722; which remains coordinated to the cluster. DFT studies suggest that key steps in the mechanism involve nucleophilic attack of an oxymethylene on a formyl ligand to generate an unstable [C2O2H3]3&#8722; fragment, which undergoes subsequent deoxygenation.

Addition of CO to a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster results in both carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation and deoxygenation to generate an acetaldehyde enolate [C2OH3]&#8722; which remains coordinated to the cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of formation of an isolable complex containing an [C2OH3]&#8722; fragment from reaction of CO with a metal hydride, and the first example of CO homologation and deoxygenation at a main group metal. DFT studies suggest that key steps in the mechanism involve nucleophilic attack of an oxymethylene on a formyl ligand to generate an unstable [C2O2H3]3&#8722; fragment, which undergoes subsequent deoxygenation.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence by Organic Cocrystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a new design strategy to stabilize triplet excitons for high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence by organic cocrystal engineering. The reported cocrystal has an ultralong emission lifetime of up to 2.16&#8197;s, which is the best performance in the case of organic cocrystals under ambient conditions so far.







Abstract
Organic phosphors offer a promising alternative in optoelectronics, but their temperature&#8208;sensitive feature has restricted their applications in high&#8208;temperature scenarios, and the attainment of high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) is still challenging. Herein, a series of organic cocrystal phosphors are constructed by supramolecular assembly with an ultralong emission lifetime of up to 2.16&#8197;s. Intriguingly, remarkable stabilization of triplet excitons can also be realized at elevated temperature, and green phosphorescence is still exhibited in solid state even up to 150&#8201;&#176;C. From special molecular packing within the crystal lattice, it has been observed that the orientation of isolated water cluster and well&#8208;controlled molecular organization via multiple interactions can favor the structural rigidity of cocrystals more effectively to suppress the nonradiative transition, thus resulting in efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and unprecedented survival of HTP.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Strained meso&#8208;meso&#8208;Linked Porphyrin Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding to a template bends a photonic wire consisting of 18 meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrins into a ring, allowing covalent cyclization by Glaser coupling, to yield a strained nanoring. The 18&#8208;legged template was synthesized efficiently via six&#8208;fold iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation. The nanoring was characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).







Abstract
Strained macrocycles display interesting properties, such as conformational rigidity, often resulting in enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation or enhanced affinity for non&#8208;covalent guest binding, yet they can be difficult to synthesize. Here we use computational modeling to design a template to direct the formation of an 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring with direct meso&#8208;meso bonds between the porphyrin units. Coupling of a linear 18&#8208;porphyrin oligomer in the presence of this template gives the target nanoring, together with an unexpected 36&#8208;porphyrin ring by&#8208;product. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed the elliptical conformations and flexibility of these nanorings on a Au(111) surface.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensionally Extended Metal&#8211;Organic Ladder Compound Exhibiting Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) extended two&#8208;legged ladder compound was reported for the first time. The unique 3D extended lattice consists of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged metal chains (&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8722;I&#8722;Pt&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;) and helically arranged macrocyclic units as the constituent legs and rungs. The out&#8208;of&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;valence Pt2+/Pt4+ arrangement arises from the weak interchain correlation among adjacent legs.







Abstract
Ladder systems situated in the dimensional crossover region have attracted much attention because their electronic states and physical properties depend strongly on the electronic correlations among the constituent legs. Generally, two&#8208;/three&#8208;legged transition metal&#8208;oxide ladder compounds are studied as representative ladder systems, but two&#8208;/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) extensions based on such ladder systems with a few numbers of legs are difficult because of the extreme synthesis conditions. Here, for the first time, we report the successful creation of a 3D extended two&#8208;legged ladder compound, [Pt(en)(dpye)I]2(NO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (en=ethylenediamine; dpye=1,2&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane), which is obtained by simple oxidative polymerization of a small Pt macrocyclic complex using elemental I2. The unique 3D extended lattice consists of 1D mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged metal chains (&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8722;I&#8722;Pt&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;) and helically arranged macrocyclic units as the constituent legs and rungs, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering analyses and optical measurements revealed that the out&#8208;of&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;valence Pt2+/Pt4+ arrangement arises from the weak interchain correlation among adjacent legs. In addition, this compound shows an increase in proton conductivity by a factor of up to 1000, depending on humidity.

         <title>Controllable Double Difluoromethylene Insertions into S&#8722;Cu Bonds: (Arylthio)tetrafluoroethylation of Aryl Iodides with TMSCF2Br</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable double difluoromethylene insertions into S&#8722;Cu bonds have been developed with TMSCF2Br reagent, which provides a general synthetic protocol to contruct ArSCF2CF2Cu intermediates as well as the ArSCF2CF2Ar&#8242; products.







Abstract
A new method of constructing &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; from ArSCu and TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) has been developed. The cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the obtained &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; with diverse aryl iodides (Ar&#8242;I) provide an efficient access to Ar&#8242;CF2CF2SAr. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; species were generated through controllable double difluoromethylene insertions into ArS&#8722;Cu bonds rather than the 1,2&#8208;addition of ArSCu to tetrafluoroethylene.

         <title>Sequential C&#8722;F Bond Transformation of the Difluoromethylene Unit in Perfluoroalkyl Groups: A Combination of Fine&#8208;Tuned Phenothiazine Photoredox Catalyst and Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequential defluorinative transformation of a difluoromethylene (CF2) unit in perfluoroalkyl compounds has been achieved by a combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis acid activation. A newly developed phenothiazine&#8208;based catalyst served as an efficient catalyst for defluoroaminoxylation. Spectroscopic measurements revealed the reaction mechanism. AlCl3 facilitated further defluorinative transformation of the aminoxylated compounds.







Abstract
A sequential process via photoredox catalysis and Lewis acid mediation for C&#8722;F bond transformation of the CF2 unit in perfluoroalkyl groups has been achieved to transform perfluoroalkylarenes into complex fluoroalkylated compounds. A phenothiazine&#8208;based photocatalyst promotes the defluoroaminoxylation of perfluoroalkylarenes with (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) under visible light irradiation, affording the corresponding aminoxylated products. These products undergo a further defluorinative transformation with various organosilicon reagents mediated by AlCl3 to provide highly functionalized perfluoroalkyl alcohols. Our novel phenothiazine catalyst works efficiently in the defluoroaminoxylation. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the catalyst regeneration step is crucial for the photocatalytic aminoxylation.

         <title>Renewing Halogen Substitution Strategy for the Rational Design of High&#8208;Curie Temperature Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, this work renews the halogen substitution strategy to obtain a series of high&#8208;Tc molecular AFEs, which opens up a new pathway to design high&#8208;Tc molecular AFEs and injects new vitalities in the halogen substitution strategy.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free molecular antiferroelectric (AFE) holds a promise for energy storage on account of its unique physical attributes. However, it is challenging to explore high&#8208;curie temperature (Tc) molecular AFEs, due to the lack of design strategies regarding the rise of phase transition energy barriers. By renewing the halogen substitution strategy, we have obtained a series of high&#8208;Tc molecular AFEs of the halogen&#8208;substituted phenethylammonium bromides (x&#8208;PEAB, x=H/F/Cl/Br), resembling the binary stator&#8208;rotator system. Strikingly, the p&#8208;site halogen substitution of PEA+ cationic rotators raises their phase transition energy barrier and greatly enhances Tc up to ~473&#8197;K for Br&#8208;PEAB, on par with the record&#8208;high Tc values for molecular AFEs. As a typical case, the member 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bromide (F&#8208;PEAB) shows notable AFE properties, including high Tc (~374&#8197;K) and large electric polarization (~3.2&#8197;&#956;C/cm2). Further, F&#8208;PEAB also exhibits a high energy storage efficiency (&#951;) of 83.6&#8201;% even around Tc, catching up with other AFE oxides. This renewing halogen substitution strategy in the molecular AFE system provides an effective way to design high&#8208;Tc AFEs for energy storage devices.

         <title>Incorporation of an Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate into a Thin Film for Choline Recognition in an Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#8216;aniono&#8217; helicates have been formed by the coordination of tetraphenylethene&#8208;decorated anion&#8208;binding ligand with phosphate ions. The triple helicates can be solution&#8208;processed with a polymethyl methacrylate matrix to generate functional thin films with multiple optical properties and used to recognize choline and its derivatives in water.







Abstract
Functional thin films, being fabricated by incorporating discrete supramolecular architectures, have potential applications in research areas such as sensing, energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Here, we have determined that an anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate can be solution&#8208;processed into a functional thin film by incorporation into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The thin films fabricated by the incorporation of the anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate show multiple optical properties, such as fluorescence, CD, and CPL. In addition, the film has the ability to recognize choline and choline derivatives in a water system. The successful recognition of Ch+ by the film represents the first example of utilizing &#8216;aniono&#8217;&#8208;supramolecular architectures for biomolecule detection in aqueous solution and opens up a new route for designing biocompatible functional materials.

         <title>Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24&#8212;A Chromium(+IV) Nitridosilicate Phosphate with Amphibole&#8208;Type Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 14, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24, the first nitridic analog to amphibole minerals, was obtained at high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. The structure was elucidated by microfocused synchrotron diffraction, atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and magnetic measurements, which were able to prove the partial disorder of Si and Cr and the oxidation state +IV of chromium.







Abstract
The first nitridic analog of an amphibole mineral, the quaternary nitridosilicate phosphate Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24 was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400&#8201;&#176;C and 12&#8197;GPa from the binary nitrides Cr2N, Si3N4 and P3N5, using NH4N3 and NH4F as additional nitrogen source and mineralizing agent, respectively. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation (C2/m, a=9.6002(19), b=17.107(3), c=4.8530(10)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=109.65(3)&#176;). The elemental composition was analyzed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The structure consists of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming zweier double chains and edge&#8208;sharing (Si,Cr)&#8208;centered octahedra forming separated ribbons. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy shows ordered Si and Cr sites next to a disordered Si/Cr site. Optical spectroscopy indicates a band gap of 2.1&#8197;eV. Susceptibility measurements show paramagnetic behavior and support the oxidation state Cr+IV, which is confirmed by EPR. The comprehensive analysis expands the field of Cr&#8722;N chemistry and provides access to a nitride analog of one of the most prevalent silicate structures.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Spontaneous Electropolymerization Enables Robust Hydrogel Electrolyte Interfaces in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels hold great promise as electrolytes for emerging aqueous batteries, for which establishing a robust electrode&#8208;hydrogel interface is crucial for mitigating side reactions. Conventional hydrogel electrolytes fabricated by ex&#8208;situ polymerization through either thermal stimulation or photo exposure cannot ensure complete interfacial contact with electrodes. Herein, we introduce an in&#8208;situ electropolymerization approach for constructing hydrogel electrolytes. The hydrogel is spontaneously generated during the initial cycling of the battery, eliminating the need of additional initiators for polymerization. The involvement of electrodes during the hydrogel synthesis yields well&#8208;bonded and deep infiltrated electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. As a case study, we attest that, the in&#8208;situ formed polyanionic hydrogel in Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery substantially improves the stability and kinetics of both Zn anode and porous MnO2 cathode owing to the robust interfaces. This research provides insight to the function of hydrogel electrolyte interfaces and constitute a critical advancement in designing highly durable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Volume Expansion of Micron&#8208;Sized SiOx via Closed&#8208;Nanopore Structure Constructed by Mg&#8208;Induced Elemental Segregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherently huge volume expansion during Li uptake have hindered the use of Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. While some pore&#8208;forming and nano&#8208;architecting strategies show promises to effectively buffer the volume change, other parameters essential for practical electrode fabrication, such as compaction density, are often compromised. Here we propose a new in&#8208;situ Mg doping strategy to form closed&#8208;nanopore structure into a micron&#8208;sized SiOx particle at a high bulk density. The doped Mg atoms promote the segregation of O, so that high&#8208;density magnesium silicates form to generate closed nanopores. By altering the mass content of Mg dopant, the average radius (ranged from 5.4 to 9.7 nm) and porosity (ranged from 1.4% to 15.9%) of the closed pore is precisely adjustable, which accounts for volume expansion of SiOx from 77.8% to 22.2% at the minimum. Benefited from the small volume variation, the Mg&#8208;doped micron&#8208;SiOx anode demonstrate improved Li storage performance towards realization of a 700&#8208;(dis)charge&#8208;cycle, 11&#8208;Ah&#8208;pouch&#8208;type cell at a capacity retention of &gt;80%. This work offers insights into reasonable design of the internal structure of micron&#8208;sized SiOx and other materials that undergo conversion or alloying reactions with drastic volume change, to enable high&#8208;energy batteries with stable electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Polymer Chiral Co&#8208;assembly and Contactless Dynamic Chiral Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise modulation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) including formulated color coordinates and handedness is realized by quantitative supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of three similar fluorene&#8208;based polymers with distinct fluorescence, directed by the addition principle. Furthermore, a contactless chiral communication with azobenzene&#8208;containing polymer (PAzo), which is a reverse subtraction principle, is used to achieve dynamic switch of CPL.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays a pivotal role in cutting&#8208;edge display and information technologies. Currently achieving precise color control and dynamic signal regulation in CPL still remains challenging due to the elusory relationship between fluorescence and chirality. Inspired by the natural mechanisms governing color formation and chiral interaction, we proposed an addition&#8208;subtraction principle theory to address this issue. Three fluorene&#8208;based polymers synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation with different electron&#8208;deficient monomers exhibit similar structures and UV/Vis absorption, but distinct fluorescence emissions due to intramolecular charge transfer. Based on this, precise&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active films are obtained through quantitative supramolecular co&#8208;assembly directed by addition principle. Particularly, an ideal white&#8208;emitting CPL film (CIE coordinates: (0.33, 0.33)) is facilely fabricated with a high quantum yield of 80.8&#8201;% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;2. Structural analysis reveals that the ordered stacking orientation favors higher glum. Furthermore, to address the dynamically regulated challenge, the comparable subtraction principle is proposed, involving a contactless chiral communication between excited and ground states. The representative system consisting of as&#8208;prepared fluorene&#8208;based polymers and chirality&#8208;selective absorption azobenzene (Azo)&#8208;containing polymers is constructed, achieving CPL weakening, reversal, and enhancement. Finally, a switchable quick response code is realized based on trans&#8208;cis isomerization of Azo moiety.

         <title>A Versatile Thioesterase Involved in Dimerization during Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile &#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) ysfF encodes YsfF and a nested YsfFHBT. The 4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme domain in YsfF and YsfFHBT could accomplish the ring&#8208;closure reaction for benzyl ring formation. Notably, YsfF and YsfX together are responsible for ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatizing dimerization. Furthermore, Asn301, Glu483, and His566 were found to be active&#8208;site residues for both activities.







Abstract
The cinnamoyl lipid compound youssoufene A1 (1), featuring a unique dearomatic carbon&#8208;bridged dimeric skeleton, exhibits increased inhibition against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis as compared to monomeric youssoufenes. However, the formation process of this intriguing dearomatization/dimerization remains unknown. In this study, an unusual &#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) gene ysfF was functionally characterized. The gene was found to naturally encodes two proteins, an entire YsfF with &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase (4&#8208;HBT)&#8208;like enzyme domains, and a nested YsfFHBT (4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme). Using an intracellular tagged carrier&#8208;protein tracking (ITCT) strategy, in vitro reconstitution and in vivo experiments, we found that: i) both domains of YsfF displayed thioesterase activities; ii) YsfF/YsfFHBT could accomplish the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure for benzene ring formation; and iii) YsfF and cyclase YsfX together were responsible for the ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatization/dimerization process, possibly through an unprecedented Michael&#8208;type addition reaction. Moreover, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that N301, E483 and H566 of YsfF are critical residues for both the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and dimerization processes. This study enhances our understanding of the multifunctionality of the TE protein family.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with Low Crystallinity for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with low crystallinity has been synthesized that has a high power factor of up to 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in solution&#8208;processed flexible organic thermoelectrics. The flexible devices also show good resistance to bending strain, with only marginal changes in the electrical conductivity after 600 bending cycles.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low crystallinity are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures of these CPs can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. However, n&#8208;doped CPs usually exhibit poor thermoelectric performance, which hinders the development of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n&#8208;type CP (ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz) comprising two acceptor units: a thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and a cyano&#8208;functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz shows a low LUMO energy level of below &#8722;4.20&#8197;eV and features low crystallinity, enabling high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual&#8208;acceptor design enhances polaron delocalization, resulting in good thermoelectric performance. After n&#8208;doping, ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz exhibits an average electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 50.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor (PF) of 126.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, which is among the highest values reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type CPs to date.

     alt="An n-Type Conjugated Polymer with Low Crystallinity for High-Performance Organic Thermoelectrics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An n-type conjugated polymer with low crystallinity has been synthesized that has a high power factor of up to 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in solution-processed flexible organic thermoelectrics. The flexible devices also show good resistance to bending strain, with only marginal changes in the electrical conductivity after 600 bending cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low crystallinity are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures of these CPs can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. However, n-doped CPs usually exhibit poor thermoelectric performance, which hinders the development of high-performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n-type CP (ThDPP-CNBTz) comprising two acceptor units: a thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and a cyano-functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP-CNBTz shows a low LUMO energy level of below &#8722;4.20&#8197;eV and features low crystallinity, enabling high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual-acceptor design enhances polaron delocalization, resulting in good thermoelectric performance. After n-doping, ThDPP-CNBTz exhibits an average electrical conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;) of 50.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum power factor (PF) of 126.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is among the highest values reported for solution-processed n-type CPs to date. Additionally, a solution-processed flexible OTE device based on doped ThDPP-CNBTz exhibits a maximum PF of 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; the flexible device also shows remarkable resistance to bending strain, with only a marginal change in &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt; after 600 bending cycles. The findings presented in this work will advance the development of n-type CPs for OTE devices, and flexible devices in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Detailed electronic structure analysis of the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster having a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom reveal that the proposal by Huo et&#8197;al. having multi&#8208;reference character is over ambiguous.







Abstract
Recently, Huo et&#8197;al. has commented on our communication (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312, DOI: 10.1002/anie.202317312), regarding the multireference character (MRC) of our proposed cluster. Their argument is based on small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, fractional occupation density (FOD) and CASPT2(12,13) calculations. They also proposed that the singlet planar In4H+ cluster cannot be observed. We present our calculations which reveals that some of their arguments are based on wrong interpretation of data and inadequate use of methodology. While we certainly agree with the strong physical ground of FOD, CASSF and CASPT2 methodology, we believe that such analysis for clusters is not adequate.

         <title>Li+ Cations Activate NiFeOOH for Oxygen Evolution in Sodium and Potassium Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction on NiFeOOH has a known activity dependence on the electrolyte composition: CsOH&gt;Na/KOH&gt;LiOH. Here, we show that addition of LiOH to NaOH at constant pH results in improved OER rates due to mitigation of non&#8208;kinetic effects. We show that this is due increased intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide into the layered material in the presence of Li+.







Abstract
The efficiency of electrolysis is reduced due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides catalyst properties, electrocatalytic activity also depends on the interaction of the electrocatalyst with the electrolyte. Here, we show that the addition of small amounts of Li+ to Fe&#8208;free NaOH or KOH electrolytes activates NiFeOOH for the OER compared to single&#8208;cation electrolytes. Moreover, the activation was maintained when the solution was returned to pure NaOH. Importantly, we show that the origin of activation by Li+ cations is primarily non&#8208;kinetic in nature, as the OER onset for the mixed electrolyte does not change and the Tafel slope at low current density is ~30&#8197;mV/dec in both electrolytes. However, the increase of the apparent Tafel slope remains lower at increasing current densities in the presence of Li+. Based on electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we show that this reduction of non&#8208;kinetic effects is due to enhanced intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide. This enhanced electrolyte penetration facilitates the OER, especially at higher current densities and for increased catalyst loading. Our work shows that mixed electrolytes where distinct cations can have different roles provide a simple and promising strategy towards improved OER rates.

         <title>A Triply&#8208;Periodic&#8208;Minimal&#8208;Surface Structured Interphase based on Fluorinated Polymers Strengthening High&#8208;energy Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we pioneer the incorporation of Triple Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures into lithium battery designs, successfully aligning safety with energy density&#8208;crucial for advanced electric vehicles. Leveraging the biomimetic design inspired by sea urchin skeletons, TPMS enhances Li+ conductivity and mechanical robustness, curtailing dendrite growth and intrusion. Employing a LiFePO4 cathode at a low N/P ratio of ~3, our approach yields a remarkably low capacity fade rate of just 0.002&#8201;% per cycle at a 1&#8197;C rate. Furthermore, TPMS&#8242;s efficient structure halves the interfacial layer&#8216;s mass, substantially elevating the battery&#8216;s energy density. This innovation offers a viable, scalable strategy to overcome the historical trade&#8208;off between battery safety and energy density.







Abstract
The challenge of constructing a mechanically robust yet lightweight artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on lithium (Li) anodes highlights a trade&#8208;off between high battery safety and high energy density. Inspired by the intricate microstructure of the white sea urchin, we first develop a polyvinyl fluoride&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) interfacial layer with a triple periodic minimal surface structure (TPMS) that could offer maximal modulus with minimal weight. This design endows high mechanical strength to an ordered porous structure, effectively reduces local current density, polarization, and internal resistance, and stabilizes the anode interface. At a low N/P ratio of ~3, using LiFePO4 as the cathode, Li anodes protected by TPMS&#8208;structured PVDF&#8208;HFP achieve an extremely low capacity&#8208;fading&#8208;rate of approximately 0.002&#8201;% per cycle over 200 cycles at 1&#8197;C, with an average discharge capacity of 142&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the TPMS porous structure saves 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the interfacial layer mass, thereby enhancing the energy density of the battery. The TPMS structure is conducive to large&#8208;scale additive manufacturing, which will provide a reference for the future development of lightweight, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density secondary batteries.

         <title>Unique Double and Triple Decker Arrangements of Rare&#8208;Earth 9,10&#8208;Diborataanthracene Complexes Featuring Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rare&#8208;earth complexes featuring diborataanthracene ligands are showcased. These are not only the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker compounds featuring a six&#8208;membered ring as a deck but also the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere.







Abstract
Herein, we present the first report on the synthesis of rare&#8208;earth complexes featuring a 9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene ligand. This 14&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron ligand is highly reductive and was previously used in small&#8208;molecule activation. Salt elimination reactions between dipotassium 9,10&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] (CotTIPS=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)2C8H6) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio yielded heteroleptic sandwich complexes [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). These compounds form Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;free one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers when crystallised from toluene. In contrast, reaction of [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio led to the formation of heteroleptic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). Notably, these are not only the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker compounds featuring a six&#8208;membered ring as a deck but also the first trivalent lanthanide triple&#8208;decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere. Magnetic investigations reveal that [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln=Dy, Er) and [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)ErIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)ErIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] exhibit Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour. In the case of [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln=Dy, Er), the introduction of a second near lanthanide ion results in strong antiferromagnetic interactions, allowing the enhancement of the magnetic characteristic of the system, compared to the quasi isolated counterpart. This research renews the overlooked coordination chemistry of the DBA ligand and expands it to encompass rare&#8208;earth elements.

&lt;p&gt;The first rare-earth complexes featuring diborataanthracene ligands are showcased. These are not only the first lanthanide triple-decker compounds featuring a six-membered ring as a deck but also the first lanthanide triple-decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present the first report on the synthesis of rare-earth complexes featuring a 9,10-diborataanthracene ligand. This 14-&#960;-electron ligand is highly reductive and was previously used in small-molecule activation. Salt elimination reactions between dipotassium 9,10-diethyl-9,10-diborataanthracene [K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(DEDBA)] and [Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(thf)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;] (Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;=1,4-(&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio yielded heteroleptic sandwich complexes [K(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-DEDBA)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). These compounds form Lewis-base-free one-dimensional coordination polymers when crystallised from toluene. In contrast, reaction of [K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(DEDBA)] and [Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(thf)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;] in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio led to the formation of heteroleptic triple-decker complexes [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-DEDBA)Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). Notably, these are not only the first lanthanide triple-decker compounds featuring a six-membered ring as a deck but also the first trivalent lanthanide triple-decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere. Magnetic investigations reveal that [K(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-DEDBA)] (Ln=Dy, Er) and [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)Er&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-DEDBA)Er&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)] exhibit Single-Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour. In the case of [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-DEDBA)Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-Cot&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)] (Ln=Dy, Er), the introduction of a second near lanthanide ion results in strong antiferromagnetic interactions, allowing the enhancement of the magnetic characteristic of the system, compared to the quasi isolated counterpart. This research renews the overlooked coordination chemistry of the DBA ligand and expands it to encompass rare-earth elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized Phenanthrene Imide&#8208;Based Polymers for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenanthrene (PhA)&#8208;based electron&#8208;deficient moieties were developed and dual functionalization strategy was utilized to fine&#8208;tune the molecular lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The synergetic effects from imide and carbonyl or cyano (CN) groups gift these moieties suitable solubility and stabilized LUMOs. The CN&#8208;containing imide obtains a stronger electron&#8208;deficiency and its derivative polymer can achieve higher electron mobility under a lower voltage in transistors.







Abstract
High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymers are crucial for the advance of organic electronics field, however strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties for constructing them are still limited. The imide&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, high electron deficiency and good solubility serve as promising candidates for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers. Among the PAHs, phenanthrene (PhA) features a well&#8208;delocalized aromatic &#960;&#8208;system with multiple modifiable active sites . However, the PhA&#8208;based imides are seldom studied, mainly attributed to the synthetic challenge. Herein, we report two functionalized PhAs, CPOI and CPCNI, by simultaneously incorporating imide with carbonyl or dicyanomethylene onto PhA. Notably, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;modified CPCNI exhibits a well stabilized LUMO energy level (&#8722;3.84&#8197;eV), attributed to the synergetic inductive effect from imide and cyano groups. Subsequently, based on CPOI and CPCNI, two polymers PCPOI&#8208;Tz and PCPCNI&#8208;Tz were developed. Applied to organic thin&#8208;film transistors, owing to the strong electron&#8208;deficiency of CPCNI, polymer PCPCNI&#8208;Tz shows an improved electron mobility and largely decreased threshold voltage compared with PCPOI&#8208;Tz. This work affords two structurally novel electron&#8208;deficient building blocks and highlights the effectiveness of dual functionalization of PhAs with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups for devising n&#8208;type polymers.

         <title>Fused Azulenyl Squaraine Derivatives Improve Phototheranostics in the Second Near&#8208;Infrared Window by Concentrating Excited State Energy on Non&#8208;Radiative Decay Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PS&#8208;1 nanoparticles based on fused azulenyl squaraine derivatives exhibit remarkable second near&#8208;infrared phototheranostic performance by allowing almost all excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways. Additionally, long&#8208;wavelength light harvesting capability also increases due to J aggregation. Finally, the potential of PS&#8208;1 nanoparticles for treating deep&#8208;seated cancer and root canal infection were demonstrated.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) theranostics offer new opportunities for precise disease phototheranostic due to the enhanced tissue penetration and higher maximum permissible exposure of NIR&#8208;II light. However, traditional regimens lacking effective NIR&#8208;II absorption and uncontrollable excited&#8208;state energy decay pathways often result in insufficient theranostic outcomes. Herein a phototheranostic nano&#8208;agent (PS&#8208;1 NPs) based on azulenyl squaraine derivatives with a strong NIR&#8208;II absorption band centered at 1092&#8197;nm is reported, allowing almost all absorbed excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, leading to high photothermal conversion efficiency (90.98&#8201;%) and strong photoacoustic response. Both in vitro and in vivo photoacoustic/photothermal therapy results demonstrate enhanced deep tissue cancer theranostic performance of PS&#8208;1 NPs. Even in the 5&#8197;mm deep&#8208;seated tumor model, PS&#8208;1 NPs demonstrated a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor effect in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy. Moreover, for the human extracted tooth root canal infection model, the synergistic outcomes of the photothermal effect of PS&#8208;1 NPs and 0.5&#8201;% NaClO solution resulted in therapeutic efficacy comparable to the clinical gold standard irrigation agent 5.25&#8201;% NaClO, opening up possibilities for the expansion of NIR&#8208;II theranostic agents in oral medicine.
