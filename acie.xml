         <dc:description>
The image illustrates frustrated spins in the triangular Fe3(&#956;3&#8208;O) nodes of the MIL&#8208;101(Fe). In their Research Article (e202514014), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez, Georg Kresse and coworkers reveal the true antiferromagnetic ground state of such metal&#8208;organic frameworks by using spin&#8208;flip, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT. This intrinsic spin frustration determines structure stability and controls the temperature&#8208;dependent switch between N2 fixation and CO adsorption. The &#8220;spin&#8208;city&#8221; illustration is designed by Caroline Lechner.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells: From Failure Mechanisms to Practical Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines key failure mechanisms in pouch&#8208;type aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, including short circuits caused by zinc dendrite, high polarization due to by&#8208;product accumulation, and swelling from H2 evolution. It highlights practical solutions such as anode protective layers, separator optimizations, and electrolyte designs (e.g., hydrogels, high&#8208;entropy, co&#8208;solvents, additives). Future directions for commercialization are also discussed.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have been regarded as promising candidates for stationary energy storage owing to their low cost, inherent safety, and high volumetric energy density. To fully leverage these advantages in practical applications, the pouch cell configuration offers a favorable design with compactness and lightweight packaging. Nonetheless, commercial viability remains limited by inadequate cycling stability in pouch cells, despite the extended cycle life achieved in coin cells. In this review, we emphasize the performance gap between materials&#8208;level coin cells and device&#8208;level pouch cells and elucidate the failure mechanisms in pouch&#8208;type zinc&#8208;ion batteries. These mechanisms include internal short&#8208;circuits caused by severe zinc dendrite growth under high area capacity conditions, and high polarization resulting from by&#8208;product accumulation and hydrogen evolution due to water&#8208;induced corrosion. We then comprehensively review recent progress in zinc&#8208;ion pouch cells, highlighting strategies such as artificial protective layers on the Zn anode, separator modifications, and electrolyte design. Finally, we propose a future research direction to advance and commercialize zinc&#8208;ion battery technology.

         <title>Self&#8208;Consistent Cation&#8211;Anion Integration Eliminates Passivation Crosstalk for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied cation competition and interactions in conventional mixed passivation systems and proposed a self&#8208;consistent cation&#8211;anion integrated passivation strategy using designed PDA(TFA)2. This strategy enables chemical/field&#8208;effect passivation, interfacial bridging, and ion&#8208;migration suppression, yielding 23.23%&#8208;efficient 1.68&#8208;eV perovskite solar cells. Perovskite/silicon tandems reach 32.33% (certified 31.39%) with a record VOC of 1.992&#160;V.








Abstract
The wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) absorber in silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells face persistent challenges of interfacial defects and energy&#8208;level misalignment. Although dual&#8208;cation passivators have demonstrated the potential to address these issues simultaneously, their efficacy is hindered by cation competition for binding sites and modification conflicts, which limit further device improvement. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a self&#8208;consistent cation&#8211;anion integrated passivation (SCAP) strategy, designing a multifunctional passivator, PDA(TFA)2, where the bipolar trifluoroacetate (TFA) anion is paired with 1,3&#8208;propanediamine (PDA) cations. This SCAP approach eliminates cation competition by enabling defect and field&#8208;effect passivation in a unified framework. Specifically, the bipolar TFA anion efficiently passivates halide vacancies and bridges the perovskite and C60 interface, while the PDA cations induce surface dipoles and optimize band alignment. Therefore, optimized 1.68&#160;eV WBG perovskite solar cells achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.23% with an exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.27&#160;V. Furthermore, this strategy achieves a 32.33% PCE (31.47% certified stabilized PCE) for a 0.945&#160;cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cell, delivering an ultra&#8208;high 1.992&#160;V open&#8208;circuit voltage. These findings underscore the transformative potential of the SCAP strategy in advancing the efficiency and stability of WBG perovskite photovoltaics, paving the way for next&#8208;generation tandem solar cells.

         <title>Integration of Multiple Enzymes Within Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Cascade Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks that integrate Ru&#8208;based photocatalysts with three enzymes of formate/formaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase via co&#8208;assembly for sustained CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion through photo&#8208;enzymatic cascade catalysis with high activity and recyclability.








Abstract
The integration of photocatalysts and enzymes within confined environments offers a promising approach to developing artificial photosynthetic systems for sustainable CO2 conversion. However, the efficient coupling of photocatalysts with multiple enzymes to enable photo&#8208;enzymatic cascade catalysis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) that integrate Ru&#8208;based photocatalysts with three&#8208;enzyme cascades of formate dehydrogenase (FDH), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FaldDH), and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) via in situ co&#8208;assembly in water. The RuHOF exhibits exceptional nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) photo&#8208;regeneration activity (4.5&#160;mM&#160;h&#8722;1), while the FDH@RuHOF hybrid converts CO2 to formic acid with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 681 h&#8722;1 (238 &#181;M&#160;h&#8722;1) over 24 h. By engineering FDH/FaldDH/ADH@RuHOF ternary systems, we achieve sustained CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion through photo&#8208;enzymatic cascade catalysis, delivering 2.2&#160;mM methanol production with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 5.5% (92 &#181;M&#160;h&#8722;1) over 24&#160;h with 85% activity retention after five catalytic cycles. This work opens a promising avenue for the development of efficient multi&#8208;enzyme cascade artificial photosynthetic systems toward steady and recyclable CO2 valorization.

The &lt;b&gt;RuHOF&lt;/b&gt; exhibits exceptional nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) photo-regeneration activity (4.5&#160;mM&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), while the &lt;b&gt;FDH@RuHOF&lt;/b&gt; hybrid converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formic acid with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 681 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (238 &#181;M&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 24 h. By engineering &lt;b&gt;FDH/FaldDH/ADH@RuHOF&lt;/b&gt; ternary systems, we achieve sustained CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-methanol conversion through photo-enzymatic cascade catalysis, delivering 2.2&#160;mM methanol production with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 5.5% (92 &#181;M&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 24&#160;h with 85% activity retention after five catalytic cycles. This work opens a promising avenue for the development of efficient multi-enzyme cascade artificial photosynthetic systems toward steady and recyclable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; valorization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing High Performance Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries with Acidic Eutectic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acidic deep eutectic solvent (ZPDES) was engineered with H3PO4 and ZnCl2 to realize the high performance four&#8208;electron redox Zn&#9472;I2 batteries. The ZPDES confers suppressed corrosion behaviors of protons and Cl&#8722;, accelerates the redox kinetics of I&#8722;/I0/I+ and guides Zn (002) deposition with protons, thus realizing the Zn&#9472;I2 battery with high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability even under low N/P ratios.








Abstract
Achieving multi&#8208;electron redox reaction via halide ions and protons is promising for Zn&#9472;I2 batteries, yet their practical application is hindered by halide ion and proton corrosion, sluggish iodine redox kinetics and poor redox reversibility. Here, a deep eutectic solvent (ZPDES) composed with concentrated ZnCl2 and H3PO4 is engineered as the electrolyte for high performance Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The chloride atom (Cl) and active hydrogen of H3PO4 in DES form hydrogen bonds (Cl&#8943;H&#9472;O) to mitigate the corrosion of Cl&#8722; and protons. Therefore, while achieving four&#8208;electron transfer by Cl&#8722;, the protons in DES can accelerate redox reaction kinetics and reduce I3&#8722; formation for improved reversibility. Moreover, the proton can promote the (002) texture formation and reduce by&#8208;products on Zn anode. As a result, the Zn&#9472;I2 battery with ZPDES delivers a high specific capacity of 576&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 320 cycles, and maintains a capacity retention of 100% over 20,000 cycles at 7 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site Organoboron Catalysts Enable Sequence&#8208;Regulated Terpolymerization of Epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;Propiolactone via Intermolecular Chain Shuttling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chain shuttling terpolymerization of epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;propiolactone (BPL) is realized by using mixture of mononuclear (1) and dinuclear (2) organoboron catalysts, synthesizing gradient polycarbonate&#8208;grad&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hydroxypropiorate) (PC&#8208;grad&#8208;P3HP) terpolymers. This work establishes the first metal&#8208;free, chain&#8208;shuttling platform for sequence&#8208;regulated PC&#8208;PHA terpolymers, extending the scope of programmable biodegradable materials beyond metal&#8208;catalyzed systems.








Abstract
Sequence regulation in synthetic polymers is essential for tailoring material properties; however, achieving precise control in polycarbonate&#8208;polyhydroxyalkanoate (PC&#8208;PHA) terpolymers derived from epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;lactones remains challenging. Current metal&#8208;based catalysts lack multisite strategies for sequence diversification, limiting the formation of gradient architectures. This study employed mononuclear (catalyst 1) and dinuclear (catalyst 2) organoboron catalysts to mediate the terpolymerization of epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;propiolactone (BPL). Kinetic analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and a chain&#8208;shuttling approach with mixed catalysts were utilized to regulate sequences. Key findings indicated: i) Catalyst 1 preferentially promoted &#946;&#8208;propiolactone ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), forming tapered P3HP&#8208;b&#8208;PC blocks, whereas catalyst 2 enhanced epoxide/CO2 ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP), yielding PC&#8208;b&#8208;P3HP; ii) Boron centers kinetically suppressed ROP but increased ROCOP efficiency; iii) Mixed 1 and 2 catalysts enabled intermolecular chain shuttling, synthesizing gradient PC&#8208;grad&#8208;P3HP terpolymers; and iv) Terpolymer compositions modulated thermal properties from amorphous to crystalline. This work establishes the first metal&#8208;free, chain&#8208;shuttling platform for sequence&#8208;regulated PC&#8208;PHA terpolymers, extending the scope of programmable biodegradable materials beyond metal&#8208;catalyzed systems.

         <title>Hot Electron Photocatalysis Using Nontoxic Self&#8208;Doped Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast Auger processes efficiently generate hot electrons in quantum dots (QDs), enabling photoreduction of aryl halides (up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus SCE) and diverse cross&#8208;coupling reactions (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S). Quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs demonstrate significantly higher reactivity than CuInS2 QDs, due to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This study highlights the potential of using Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons from nontoxic QDs for challenging organic transformations under mild conditions.








Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as versatile photocatalysts for organic transformations. However, a significant drawback is their reliance on toxic metals like lead and cadmium, which limits their widespread application in solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Furthermore, current systems primarily utilize band&#8208;edge carriers for simpler photoredox reactions, while the potential for harvesting hot carriers in chemical transformations remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we developed nontoxic, cost&#8208;effective, and recyclable ternary CuInS2 and quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs as potent photocatalysts. Our findings demonstrate that hot electrons can be effectively generated through an ultrafast Auger process, enabling the photoreduction of aryl halides (with reduction potentials up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE)) and various cross&#8208;coupling (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S) transformations. Notably, quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs exhibit significantly higher reactivity compared to CuInS2 QDs, which is attributed to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This work underscores the potential of directly utilizing Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons for extreme&#8208;potential organic transformations under mild conditions using nontoxic QDs.

         <title>A Spin Descriptor Map Predicts NiFe2O4 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Cyclohexanone Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;locking mechanism is proposed, in which medium&#8208;spin magnetic sites stabilize the *NHO intermediate and weaken *NH2OH adsorption, thereby enhancing the selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis. Key descriptors&#8212;spin magnetic moment (&#181;s), N&#8211;O&#8211;catalyst angle (&#952;), and charge state (q)&#8212;are identified, with (&#181;s&#183;&#952;)3 and (cos &#952;/q) serving as predictive metrics. Then, NiFe2O4 is predicted and confirmed to achieve optimal Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of NO to NH2OH governs the performance of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis. However, the spin state transition during the NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH process, which is directly related to reaction pathways, has long been ignored. Here, we propose a spin locking mechanism via density functional theory and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator. Magnetic sites with medium spin states stabilize the *NHO intermediate by locking the spin configuration of NO to weaken *NH2OH adsorption for high selectivity. The spin magnetic moment (&#181;S), the angle between *N&#8211;O and the catalyst (&#952;), and the charge state (q) are key factors, providing a screening range of the predictive metrics (&#181;S&#183;&#952;)3 and (cos &#952;/q). The theoretically selected NiFe2O4 delivers 70% Faradaic efficiency for cyclohexanone oxime, and weakened *NH2OH adsorption is revealed by in situ spectroscopy. This work highlights the importance of spin regulation in adjusting the selectivity of electrosynthesis.

Key descriptors&#8212;spin magnetic moment (&lt;i&gt;&#181;s&lt;/i&gt;), N&#8211;O&#8211;catalyst angle (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;), and charge state (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;)&#8212;are identified, with (&lt;i&gt;&#181;s&lt;/i&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and (cos &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;) serving as predictive metrics. Then, NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is predicted and confirmed to achieve optimal Faradaic efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective hydrogenation of NO to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH governs the performance of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis. However, the spin state transition during the NO-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH process, which is directly related to reaction pathways, has long been ignored. Here, we propose a spin locking mechanism via density functional theory and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator. Magnetic sites with medium spin states stabilize the *NHO intermediate by locking the spin configuration of NO to weaken *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH adsorption for high selectivity. The spin magnetic moment (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), the angle between *N&#8211;O and the catalyst (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;), and the charge state (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;) are key factors, providing a screening range of the predictive metrics (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and (cos &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;). The theoretically selected NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; delivers 70% Faradaic efficiency for cyclohexanone oxime, and weakened *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH adsorption is revealed by in situ spectroscopy. This work highlights the importance of spin regulation in adjusting the selectivity of electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Silver Leaching from Manganese&#8211;Silver Ore Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple&#8208;structured, cyanide&#8208;free leaching system exemplifies H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgy by dissociating lattice&#8208;confined Ag in manganese&#8211;silver ore via two&#8208;stage kinetics and forming helical AgCl chains stabilized by CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; hydrogen bonds to enable&#160;&gt;&#160;90% Ag recovery.








Abstract
Silver is an increasingly scarce resource, necessitating green leaching methods for low&#8208;grade ores. Conventional cyanidation, however, suffers from extreme toxicity and environmental hazards that make it unsustainable. We report a nontoxic synergistic leaching system based on oxalic acid and cyano&#8208;functionalized branched quaternary ammonium salts. Under mild conditions, this one&#8208;step method enables efficient and selective leaching of lattice&#8208;confined silver from polymetallic manganese&#8211;silver ore, with recoveries exceeding 90%. Kinetic studies reveal a two&#8209;stage process, with an initial rapid dissolution of exposed manganese oxides releasing silver followed by a slower breakdown of the iron matrix to liberate encapsulated minerals. The core breakthrough is the discovery that AgCl combines with chloride anions from the quaternary ammonium salt to form a unique inorganic helical chain structure. The stability of this helical assembly is attributed to an ordered CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; H&#8208;bonded network. Spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that this network undergoes an energetically favorable reconstruction that overcomes the high lattice energy of AgCl. This finding demonstrates that the cooperative effect of weak H&#8208;bonds can dissociate covalently stabilized solids. Our study thus provides an innovative strategy for sustainable silver metallurgy and introduces a new paradigm of H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgical design.

A pocket watch illustrates the reversible capture of cyanide by an azacalixarene macrocycle. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide forms a metastable Meisenheimer dianion that slowly reverts to the parent macrocycle. The clockwork symbolises this dissipative cycle, where molecular design and non&#8208;covalent interactions govern the metastability of the adduct. Details of the study are reported by Simon Pascal et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202511037).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;state photoswitching has become a field of broad interest in the last decades due to unique physical and chemical properties accessible from controlling the spin state of a molecular entity. This review gives an overview of the different types of materials and classifies them into photoconformational and photochemical switches depending on the mechanism of action. It highlights milestones in the research over the years and gives a technological perspective for the future of spin&#8208;state photoswitches.








Abstract
Organic spin&#8208;state photoswitches represent an emerging class of molecular systems capable of reversibly modulating electronic spin states using light. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin&#8208;polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox&#8208;active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light&#8208;induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations. By exploring design principles and technological implications, this review underscores the unique position of all&#8208;organic spin&#8208;state photoswitches at the intersection of photochemistry, magnetism, and quantum materials development.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Alkylphosphorus(V) Compounds Using Imidazolium Phosphonites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes a synthetic approach to a wide range of unsymmetrical alkylphosphorus(V) compounds using imidazolium phosphonites as bifunctional reagents. This protocol allows the introduction of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents and various heteroatom substituents onto the P(V) scaffold. In addition, a phosphorus radical species generated by the single electron reduction of alkyl imidazolium&#8208;P(V) enabled P&#9472;C bond formation by radical addition to alkenes.








Abstract
Here, we report a synthetic approach for a wide range of unsymmetrical alkylphosphorus(V) compounds, alkyl&#8208;P(O)XY (X &#8800; Y) using imidazolium phosphonites as bifunctional reagents. This protocol consists of two sequences, C(sp3)&#9472;P bond formation via an organic photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkylation of imidazolium phosphonites with aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives and P&#9472;X (X&#9552;O, N, F, and S) bond formation via the SNP(V) reaction. In this process, the imidazolium group facilitates 1) radical addition to the phosphonite reagent by stabilizing the resulting phosphoranyl radical intermediate and 2) the SNP(V) reaction as a good leaving group. This protocol allows the introduction of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents and various heteroatom substituents onto P(V) scaffolds.

In addition, a phosphorus radical species generated by the single electron reduction of alkyl imidazolium-P(V) enabled P&#9472;C bond formation by radical addition to alkenes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we report a synthetic approach for a wide range of unsymmetrical alkylphosphorus(V) compounds, alkyl-P(O)XY (X &#8800; Y) using imidazolium phosphonites as bifunctional reagents. This protocol consists of two sequences, C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;P bond formation via an organic photoredox-catalyzed decarboxylative alkylation of imidazolium phosphonites with aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives and P&#9472;X (X&#9552;O, N, F, and S) bond formation via the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;P(V) reaction. In this process, the imidazolium group facilitates 1) radical addition to the phosphonite reagent by stabilizing the resulting phosphoranyl radical intermediate and 2) the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;P(V) reaction as a good leaving group. This protocol allows the introduction of &lt;i&gt;primary&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;secondary&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tertiary&lt;/i&gt; alkyl substituents and various heteroatom substituents onto P(V) scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Design of Asymmetric Difluorinated Ether Electrolytes for Stable Operation of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated alkyl groups were found to greatly influence the Li+ transport behavior and final interface chemistry of derived ether electrolytes. The Li&#9472;F coordination of the &#9472;CF2H group is proven to tailor electrolyte solvation and enable optimal electrochemical performance, while the &#9472;CF2CF2H group shows no Li&#9472;F coordination and leads to the sluggish transport of Li+ cations.








Abstract
Fluorination of electrolyte solvents is key to improving the cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet the critical role of fluorinated alkyl chain length in governing solvation and interphase chemistries remains unclear. Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the &#9472;CF2H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li&#9472;F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated &#9472;CF2CF2H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li+ ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual&#8208;layer interface featuring a LiF&#8208;rich inner phase and a Li2CO3&#8208;dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO2 cells (2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140&#8208;mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles. Our study offers fundamental insights into the design of advanced fluorinated electrolytes for the stable operation of high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>A Chemically Tailorable Multifunctional Protein Platform for Glutamatergic Neuron Targeting in Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidoreductase from cyanobacteria was discovered to actively target glutamatergic neurons in living mouse brains and penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier with high efficiency, being thoroughly explored as a chemically tailorable protein platform for cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific neuron labeling and neuromodulation in vivo.








Abstract
Targeting glutamatergic neurons is critical for understanding brain functions and treating neurological disorders linked to glutamate dysregulation. However, existing methods face challenges including low specificity, slow kinetics, poor blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and reliance on transgenic pathways. Here, we report the cyanobacterial ferredoxin&#8208;dependent glutamate synthase (Fd&#8208;GOGATcb) as a non&#8208;transgenic, multifunctional platform for rapid and selective targeting of glutamatergic neurons in vivo. We demonstrate the high affinity of Fd&#8208;GOGATcb to glutamatergic neuron membranes that allows for fixation&#8208;free labeling within 1&#8211;2 h, and its self&#8208;deliverable BBB&#8208;crossing capability via systemic administration in living mice. When conjugated with functional motifs (e.g., fluorophores or photosensitizers), Fd&#8208;GOGATcb enables in vivo glutamatergic neuron&#8208;targeted imaging and neuromodulation, displaying region&#8208;specific enrichment in glutamate&#8208;dependent brain circuits and light&#8208;responsive neuron inhibition through intravenous delivery of photodynamic conjugates. This platform addresses longstanding barriers for direct neuron targeting and manipulation in vivo, proving its adaptability for versatile applications by chemical functionalization and potential transformative value in glutamate&#8208;centered fundamental research and clinical translation.

         <title>Central Dynamic Conversion of Dicyanomethyl Radicals via Intermolecular Charge Transfer for Ultrabright NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging&#8208;Guided Mild Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II stable organic radical dye has been synthesized with incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl&#8208;functionalized phenoxazine, and relative polypeptide nanoparticles shows ultra&#8208;high absolute fluorescence quantum yield in the NIR&#8208;II region. This innovative system enables ultrahigh&#8208;brightness fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided mild photothermal therapy for tumors.








Abstract
Stable organic radicals have emerged as promising candidates in biotheranostics owing to their unique electronic configurations and tunable photophysical characteristics. Among these, dicyanomethyl radical derivatives stand out as key players in dynamic covalent chemistry, demonstrating exceptional temperature&#8208;responsive reversible polymerization&#8208;dissociation dynamics and remarkable long&#8208;wavelength absorption profiles despite their low molecular weights. In this work, we developed a novel radical system designated CNPJ through the strategic incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl&#8208;functionalized phenoxazine scaffold. The stability and radical nature of CNPJ were first corroborated by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Structural analyses revealed two critical phenomena enabled by efficient spin delocalization and intermolecular charge transfer: i) polarity&#8208;triggered radical center redistribution and ii) thermally regulated monomer&#8210;&#960; dimer equilibrium. These distinctive features confer enhanced structural rigidity and an exceptional absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 2.57%, a remarkably high value for near&#8208;infrared emitters, accompanied by a bathochromically shifted &#960; dimer absorption band centered at 960&#160;nm. Capitalizing on these attributes, we engineered a theranostic platform by integrating CNPJ with the pH&#8208;responsive amphiphilic polymer PEA through pifithrin&#8208;&#956; (PES) inhibitor mediation. This system achieves ultrahigh&#8208;brightness fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided mild photothermal tumor therapy, yielding promising therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Poly(p&#8208;phenylene phosphaborene): A Modified Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with &#960;&#8208;Conjugated B&#9552;P Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene phosphaborene) (BP&#8208;PPV), derived from poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by substitution of the bridging C&#9552;C moieties by valence isoelectronic B&#9552;P units, has been prepared. The polymer and related monodisperse oligomers feature an effectively &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone&#8212;involving the B&#9552;P bonds&#8212;and they show fluorescence from a pyramidalized excited state as well as aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE).








Abstract
While the isoelectronic substitution of selected C&#9552;C by B&#9552;N units in &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds has evolved into a well&#8208;established concept to create novel hybrid materials with modified properties, the use of valence isoelectronic B&#9552;P units for such purposes has been hardly explored. Herein, we demonstrate substitutional doping of the famous optoelectronic organic polymer poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) with B&#9552;P linking groups for the first time. We report on the successful synthesis of a soluble polymer and a series of monodisperse oligomers of BP&#8208;PPV type. Our structural and photophysical investigations, supported by in&#8208;depth DFT calculations, evidence effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation along their backbone, which is similary pronounced as in their previously reported BN congeners. In addition, the novel BCP compounds show distinct fluorescence emission in solution and emission enhancement upon aggregation (AIEE), occurring from a P&#8208;pyramidalized excited state.

         <title>Ru&#8208;RuO2 Coordinated with Si&#8208;Supported GaN Nanowires for Light&#8208;Driven Simultaneous Activation of CO2 and H2 to Achieve Exceptional Reverse Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual site Ru&#8208;RuO2 cocatalyst anchored on GaN NWs provides distinct active sites for the simultaneous activation of both CO2 and H2, with metallic Ru domains facilitating H2 dissociation, thus leading to a remarkable RWGS reactivity. Upon concentrated light illumination, significant charge carrier generation occurs alongside with notable photothermal effects on the catalyst surface, which deeply facilitates the reaction.








Abstract
The reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction presents an industrial promise for carbon dioxide valorization. In this work, a dual&#8208;site Ru&#8208;RuO2 cocatalyst anchored on Si&#8208;supported GaN nanowires (NWs) is developed for solar&#8208;powered CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The assembled Si&#8208;supported GaN NWs/Ru&#8208;RuO2 delivers a considerable CO rate of 57.89&#160;mmol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% selectivity under illumination at 5.5&#160;W&#183;cm&#8722;2 without external heating, along with a remarkable turnover frequency of 2.28&#160;&#215;&#160;105 h&#8722;1. The temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, in situ spectroscopic characterization, and DFT calculations collectively reveal that the Si&#8208;supported GaN NWs/Ru&#8208;RuO2 enables simultaneous activation of CO2 and H2. Moreover, the synergy between Ru&#8208;RuO2 and GaN substantially reduces the reaction energy barrier from 0.83 to 0.64&#160;eV via the key *COOH intermediate, thereby establishing a new benchmark for light&#8208;driven RWGS efficiency. This work provides a strategic design for high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and opens avenues for downstream synthetic applications.

         <title>Metallaphosphirenes with &#963;&#8208;Aromaticity: Capture of Phosphorus Atom by Metalla&#8208;Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

Unique &#963;&#8208;aromatic metallaphosphirene rings can be generated through P atom trapping by metal carbyne via a formal [1&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction.








Abstract
Unsaturated phosphorus heterocycles typically exhibit diminished &#960;&#8208;aromaticity. A unique entry into metallaphosphirenes featuring &#963;&#8208;aromaticity within an unsaturated framework is reported. Reaction of sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP) with cyclic metal carbyne 1 affords phosphorus atom transfer through a formal [1&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition pathway. The formation of metallaphosphirene ring was computationally modelled using density functional theory, revealing that [1&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition involves direct nucleophilic attack step and, thus, depends on the amphiphilicity of carbyne atom. Comprehensive DFT calculations, including NICS, ACID, GIMIC, EDDB, and NOBD analysis, confirm the predominantly &#963;&#8208;aromatic nature of the metal&#8208;based phosphirene system. The reactivity of the metallaphosphirene in cycloaddition reactions is in accord with its &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, which tends to retain the three&#8208;membered heterocycle with &#955;3&#8208;P atom.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Skeletal Editing of Natural Product Scaffolds via P450&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208;Selective Ring Expansion at Aliphatic C&#9472;H Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic strategy is reported for enabling skeletal editing of a target molecule via ring expansion at the level of one or more aliphatic C&#9472;H sites. By combining P450&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective C&#9472;H oxidation with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger rearrangement or ketone homologation, a panel of structurally diverse, ring&#8208;expanded analogs of a series of natural products was obtained, illustrating the potential value of this approach for the discovery of new bioactive molecules.








Abstract
Methods for introducing subtle modifications at the level of single atoms/bonds (&#8220;skeletal editing&#8221;) are highly desirable in organic and medicinal chemistry, owing to their potential for fine&#8208;tuning the structure and biological activity of organic molecules. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for enabling the skeletal editing of organic frameworks via ring expansion at the level of one or more aliphatic (methylene) C&#9472;H sites, as achieved through the synergistic combination of P450&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective oxidation with subsequent Baeyer&#8211;Villiger rearrangement or ketone homologation. Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring&#8208;expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C&#9472;H sites with tunable site&#8208;selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.

         <dc:description>
A triple C&#9472;C cascade approach to the synthesis of heteroaryl cyclopropanes is described. The reaction is metal&#8208;free, uses simple starting materials, and presents a new retrosynthetic approach for heteroaryl cyclopropane synthesis. A change of substituent creates a new route to sultines, under&#8208;explored motifs in medicinal chemistry.








Abstract
We describe a triple C&#9472;C bond cascade process for heteroaryl cyclopropane synthesis, through the reaction of vinyl sulfonium salts and sulfones under mild conditions. An initial conjugate addition (C&#9472;C bond 1) sets up a Smiles&#8211;Truce rearrangement (C&#9472;C bond 2), with a final 3&#8208;exo&#8208;tet ring closure (C&#9472;C bond 3) affording cyclopropanes. Serendipitously, we uncovered a novel reaction variant that affords sultines, an under&#8208;explored heterocycle with potential application as a bioisostere in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Achieving Efficient Self&#8208;Driven Full&#8208;Stokes Photodetection in Optically Active Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports the first chiral&#8208;free, self&#8208;driven full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection in an optically active ferroelectric. The demonstrated device enables accurate characterization of the state of polarization with low Stokes parameter errors, offering a new route for compact polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronics.








Abstract
Full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, enabling the acquisition of complete polarization information, is crucial across various fields such as target identification, robotic perception, and 3D reconstruction. Nevertheless, achieving efficient multiple polarization state detection simultaneously with high recognition accuracy in a compact device remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, we report an optically active ferroelectric OA2EA2Pb3Br10 (1, where OA is n&#8208;octylammonium, EA is ethylammonium), capable of realizing a self&#8208;driven full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection. Utilizing the bulk photovoltaic effect in 1, simultaneous detection of both linearly and circularly polarized light can be achieved without requiring an external bias. The in&#8208;plane photodetection configuration exhibits a high linear polarization ratio of 2.7 and a circular polarization anisotropy factor of 0.46. More importantly, the full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection achieves low average measurement errors for the Stokes parameters of 3.2%&#8211;5.3%. This study establishes a new paradigm for the rational design of ferroelectric materials that enable self&#8208;driven, filterless full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection.

&lt;p&gt;This paper reports the first chiral-free, self-driven full-Stokes polarization detection in an optically active ferroelectric. The demonstrated device enables accurate characterization of the state of polarization with low Stokes parameter errors, offering a new route for compact polarization-sensitive optoelectronics.

         <title>Design of Aminophosphine Precursor for Robust Synthesis of InP Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylsiylamine&#8208;based aminophosphine precursor was newly introduced to synthesize InP quantum dots (QDs). This new aminophosphine showed a faster reaction process compared to the conventional aminophosphine, resulting in the near&#8208;unity quantum yield (QY) and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#160;nm without additional purification.








Abstract
Aminophosphines have emerged as promising phosphorus candidates for the synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs), offering an alternative to traditional tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine. However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe3)2]2H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe3)2]2H with InCl3, leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near&#8208;unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48&#160;nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III&#8208;V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Insertion of Organic Sulfur Into a Fe6C Carbide Carbonyl Cluster, Including the Natural Amino Acid L&#8208;Cysteine: Vibrational Circular Dichroism and Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure for the functionalization with organosulfur ligands of hexa&#8208;iron carbide carbonyl clusters. This synthetic procedure is highly versatile and may be applied to alkyl, aryl, and functionalized organic sulfur reagents, including the chiral amino acids L&#8208; and D&#8208;cysteine. Chirality transfer from cysteine to the CO ligands of the Fe6C cluster has been observed by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). 








Abstract
We present a straightforward and versatile synthetic route to Fe6C carbide carbonyl clusters containing organosulfur ligands, including the chiral amino acid L&#8208; and D&#8208;cysteine. Reaction of the reduced cluster [NEt4]4[Fe6C(CO)15] (1) with thiols (RSH) or disulfides (RSSR) affords novel functionalized hexa&#8208;iron carbide clusters [NEt4]3[Fe6C(CO)14(SR)] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3, 2; C6H5, 3; p&#8208;C6H4CH3, 4; L&#8208;cysteine, L&#8208;5; D&#8208;cysteine, D&#8208;5). Compounds 2&#8211;5 have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR), 1H and 13C{1H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of 2&#8211;4 have been determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). The chirality of the L&#8208;5 and D&#8208;5 enantiomers has been investigated by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and this represents the first VCD study of chiral metal carbonyl clusters. Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the &#957;CO region of both L&#8208;5 and D&#8208;5. This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH2 and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.

Gold compressed in the presence of a hydrocarbon hydrogen source was heated with an X&#8208;ray free electron laser in a pump&#8208;probe experiment. Above 40&#160;GPa and 2200&#160;K, it reacts to form hexagonal gold hydride. The hydrogen is superionic in the gold lattice and diffuses freely. Gold is usually known as an unreactive metal, and its enhanced reactivity under extreme conditions points to modifications to chemistry in this regime, as explained by Mungo Frost et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202505811).

         <dc:description>
Harnessing multisite proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) through deprotonation of a photoactive Zr coordination cage unlocks oxidative photocatalysis of strong C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. This reactivity overcomes the energetic barrier that renders electron transfer alone inaccessible. The Zr platform acts as an ambipolar mediator that unites oxidative and reductive PCET pathways, each operating through distinct mechanisms, and offers new insights for sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion, as reported by Pablo Garrido&#8208;Barros et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202510723).

This reactivity overcomes the energetic barrier that renders electron transfer alone inaccessible. The Zr platform acts as an ambipolar mediator that unites oxidative and reductive PCET pathways, each operating through distinct mechanisms, and offers new insights for sustainable solar-to-chemical energy conversion, as reported by Pablo Garrido-Barros et&#160;al. in their Communication (&lt;a target="_blank"

In their Research Article (e202507119), Hyun&#8208;Wook Lee et al. reveal that ligand exchange between cyanide and hydroxide in a hexacyanochromate negolyte, driven by coordination disruption of [Cr(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, is a key stability factor. Optimizing the [OH&#8722;]/[CN&#8722;] ratio stabilizes the redox mediator, enabling long&#8208;term performance in aqueous iron&#8208;chromium redox flow batteries.

Research on supramolecular polymers has advanced rapidly toward the development of synthetic multicomponent systems. This review highlights recent progress in understanding their assembly mechanisms and how these influence structural and functional properties. Emerging data&#8208;driven approaches, particularly machine learning, offer new opportunities for rational design and characterization, shaping the future of supramolecular chemistry.








Abstract
Inspired by the dynamic assembly of fibrillar proteins in biology, research on supramolecular polymers has progressed rapidly toward the development of synthetic multicomponent systems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the study of supramolecular polymers in solution, with an emphasis on how combined computational and experimental approaches deepen our understanding of these systems. In particular, these studies have elucidated the mechanisms of protein aggregation and provided insights into the characteristics of synthetic systems. We discuss the classification of these polymers and systems, highlighting how their different interaction modes and microstructures give rise to diverse structural and functional properties. In addition, we outline the emerging role of machine learning as a powerful tool to navigate the inherent complexity of these systems, thereby enhancing strategies for rational design and characterization. This review highlights how computational approaches, from traditional modeling to emerging machine learning techniques, enable the experimental characterization and understanding of supramolecular polymer chemistry.

Space&#8208;confined synthesis has emerged as a potential strategy for constructing advanced electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Water splitting represents a sustainable and environmentally benign approach for green hydrogen generation and future clean energy solutions. In this context, space&#8208;confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in&#8208;situ/operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D&#8208;3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in&#8208;situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;guided design and structure&#8211;property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in&#8208;situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Negative Ammonia Production from the Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work demonstrates a carbon&#8208;negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces NH3 from air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO2 (DAC), which achieves low&#8208;cost DAC process with exceptional CO2 capacity and free ammonia production. This paves a new way in the development of sustainable and negative&#8208;emission technologies.








Abstract
Ammonia holds paramount importance as a fundamental chemical commodity for large&#8208;scale production of fertilisers and hydrogen carriers. The conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process relies heavily on fossil fuels, making ammonia synthesis a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we show a carbon&#8208;negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces ammonia from the air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO2 (DAC). This process uses lithium as a mediator to cleave the nitrogen gas via a nitridation reaction at ambient pressure below 80&#160;&#176;C. Exposing the nitride to moisture naturally yields ammonia. The co&#8208;produced lithium hydroxide intermediate allows for spontaneous absorption of CO2 with an exceptional capacity of 18.4&#160;mmol CO2/g. The resultant lithium carbonate is electrolysed at ambient conditions to recycle the metallic lithium and release high&#8208;purity gaseous CO2. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of ammonia production from air coupled with DAC paves a new way for the development of sustainable and negative&#8208;emission technologies.

         <title>Bridging Donor Ligands Enable an Ultrastable Graphite Anode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) is taken as a bridging&#8208;donor&#8208;ligand model to expand graphite interlayers and construct ligand channels that stabilize Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent structures. It mitigates volume changes and boosts energy density. The graphite anode achieved a cycle life exceeding 5000 cycles (over 8 months) with 94% retention, and the capacity release of the NVP||graphite full cell was increased by 33%.








Abstract
Graphite is widely utilized as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and excellent structural stability during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, which contribute to a long cycle life. However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging&#8208;donor&#8208;ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA&#8722;), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal&#8208;ion battery electrolytes.

         <title>Efficient Electronic&#8208;Structure Methods Toward Catalyst Screening: Projection&#8208;Based Embedding Theory for CO2 Reduction Reaction Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows how projection&#8208;based embedding theory can be successfully applied to study chemical reactions on metal surfaces by providing guidelines for adequate system partitioning and an appropriate description of the intersystem interactions. This efficient and systematically improvable approach contributes significantly to the computational chemistry toolbox for heterogeneous catalysis as it paves the way toward routine application.








Abstract
Catalyst screening is a demanding task for computational chemistry since the profound diversity of surface structures under operando conditions is accompanied by high demands on the accuracy to predict the relevant kinetics. Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro&#8208;)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange&#8208;correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open&#8208; and closed&#8208;shell CO2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.

         <title>Engineering Mechanostable Anticalin Scaffolds to Enhance Particle Adhesion and Targeting of CTLA&#8208;4 Under Shear Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchor&#8208;point engineering modulates the mechanostability of targeting proteins. Clickable residues were placed at 17 sites on a CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;binding Anticalin and probed by AFM and particle&#8208;based adhesion assays. Pulling from K62 located farthest from CTLA&#8208;4&#8242;s center of mass, generated the strongest molecular complexes and the highest particle adhesion. This work introduces a simple design rule for functionalizing particles to adhere to specific cell types and resist mechanical shear.








Abstract
Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non&#8208;antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA&#8208;4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio&#8208;orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single&#8208;molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead&#8208;based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA&#8208;4) complex. Multi&#8208;regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA&#8208;4&#8242;s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA&#8208;4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.

         <title>Leveraging Electrons for Electrochemical CO2 Capture Using a Hemi&#8208;Labile Iron Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an electrochemical CO2 capture system using coordination complex with an iron center and hemi&#8208;labile ligands. This system achieves an electron utilization of 1.43 by leveraging oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent ligand coordination, enabling efficient CO2 separation from flue gas with low energy consumption and high cyclability.








Abstract

This system achieves an electron utilization of 1.43 by leveraging oxidation-state-dependent ligand coordination, enabling efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation from flue gas with low energy consumption and high cyclability.

         <title>Synthesis of Gold Hydride at High Pressure and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

Gold is an unreactive metal, but on X&#8208;ray free electron laser heating pre&#8208;compressed gold in hydrocarbons forms gold hydride above 40&#160;GPa and 2200&#160;K. The hydride has an hcp gold lattice in which superionic hydrogen atoms diffuse freely. On cooling it reverts to fcc gold, highlighting the unusual chemistry accessible under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Gold is an unreactive metal and its chemical interactions with hydrogen have only recently been explored. Here, we report the formation of gold hydride above 40&#160;GPa and 2200 K in X&#8208;ray free electron laser heated diamond anvil cells using various hydrocarbons as hydrogen sources. Above 40&#160;GPa, a hexagonal phase emerges close to the gold melting point, corresponding to a hydride with stoichiometry Au2Hx${\rm Au}_2{\rm H}_{ x}$, with x$x$ increasing from 0 to near 1 with pressure from 40 to 80 GPa. This is a high&#8208;temperature phase which reverts to face centered cubic gold on cooling to 295 K. Accompanying DFT&#8208;MD simulations are in excellent agreement with experiment and reveal the structure to consist of an hexagonal close packed gold lattice with atomic hydrogen disordered in the interstices. The hydrogen is superionic and exhibits high diffusivity through the crystalline gold lattice. Our results present the first solid&#8208;state binary compound of gold and&#160;hydrogen.

         <title>Facet Engineering and Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co Bridged Heterojunction Enable Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 as High&#8208;Performance Photocatalyst for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

This study introduces an Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 core&#8208;shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The design incorporates carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 within ZIF67&#8208;D, exposing (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption.








Abstract
Ammonia synthesis is vital for global fertilizer production but traditionally relies on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process, a major contributor to CO2 emissions. Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a sustainable alternative by harnessing solar energy under ambient conditions. However, challenges such as low nitrogen adsorption, poor conductivity, and high electron&#8208;hole recombination of the photocatalysts limit their efficiency. This study introduces an Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 core&#8208;shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co bridged Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This design incorporates carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 in ZIF67&#8208;D (ZIF67&#8208;dodecahedron) with exposed (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption. Fe&#9472;N4 and Co&#9472;N4 active sites improve catalytic activity, while the carbon layer enhances conductivity and facilitates oxygen vacancy formation. The Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co bridged heterojunction further promotes charge separation and transfer. Therefore, the Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 composite achieves an outstanding ammonia yield of 33.2 mmol&#160;L&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (outperforming other systems) with high selectivity and minimal by&#8208;products. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts by integrating the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks, core&#8208;shell architectures, and interfacial engineering, marking a significant step forward in sustainable ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Ensemble of Active Acid Sites on Amorphous Silica&#8211;Alumina Surfaces for Catalytic Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina plays a key role in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), but its active sites are hard to define due to atomic disorder. Here, we analyze its structure&#8211;acidity relationship under FCC conditions and observe that diverse acid sites emerge, including zeolite&#8208;like and pseudo&#8208;bridging Br&#248;nsted sites, influenced by Si content and hydroxylation. Using theory and experiments we confirm Br&#248;nsted acidity peaks at an optimal Si coverage.








Abstract
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina are critical materials in catalysis, particularly for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). However, the atomic scale understanding of the active sites has been challenging, because of the nonuniform atomic distribution and the material's amorphous nature. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT), machine learning potentials and sampling methods to investigate the relationship between structure and acidity in silica&#8208;modified alumina. Under FCC conditions, we predict an ensemble of acid sites with diverse local structures and a spectrum of acid strengths, including zeolite&#8208;like bridging Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) and pseudo&#8208;bridging silanol BAS. This distribution is influenced by surface structure, Si coverage, and extent of hydroxylation, shaped by synthesis methods and reaction conditions. Experiments using a model Si&#8208;stabilized alumina catalyst confirm that Br&#248;nsted acidity increases with Si content, peaking at an optimal value before declining. These insights provide a foundation for designing efficient solid acid catalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Polymerization of 1,2&#8208;Dithiolane Derivatives at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of thioctic acid and its derivatives has been developed under ambient and open&#8208;atmosphere condition. This innovative method shows high efficiency, rapid polymerization kinetics, easy handling, and broad applicability to a range of substrates. The resulting polydisulfides exhibit high conversion, strong adhesion, and impact&#8208;protective properties, enabling the generation of apparent antivibration coating.








Abstract
Recently, 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes derived polydisulfides have prompted growing research interests. An innovative polymerization method with convenient operation under mild conditions is needed for improving monomer conversion, polymerization degree, and bulk performance. Here, we report an electrochemically initiated ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of thioctic acid (TA) monomers and its derivatives at room temperature, with high monomer conversion and polymerization degree. The resulting polymer exhibits potential as a transparent and vibration&#8208;damping coating. Electrochemical oxidation was the key step for initiating the rapidly polymerization and could completely circumvent the use of chemical initiators or harsh conditions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments identified the oxidation of TA at anode accompanying with an absorption&#8208;controlled one&#8208;electron transfer process. Together with density functional theory calculations, we proposed a cationic radical&#8208;initiated polymerization process. This unique electrochemical polymerization strategy was simple, rapid, efficient, and applicable for diverse TA&#8208;derived monomers.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical ring-opening polymerization of thioctic acid and its derivatives has been developed under ambient and open-atmosphere condition. This innovative method shows high efficiency, rapid polymerization kinetics, easy handling, and broad applicability to a range of substrates. The resulting polydisulfides exhibit high conversion, strong adhesion, and impact-protective properties, enabling the generation of apparent antivibration coating.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, 1,2-dithiolanes derived polydisulfides have prompted growing research interests. An innovative polymerization method with convenient operation under mild conditions is needed for improving monomer conversion, polymerization degree, and bulk performance. Here, we report an electrochemically initiated ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioctic acid (TA) monomers and its derivatives at room temperature, with high monomer conversion and polymerization degree. The resulting polymer exhibits potential as a transparent and vibration-damping coating. Electrochemical oxidation was the key step for initiating the rapidly polymerization and could completely circumvent the use of chemical initiators or harsh conditions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments identified the oxidation of TA at anode accompanying with an absorption-controlled one-electron transfer process. Together with density functional theory calculations, we proposed a cationic radical-initiated polymerization process. This unique electrochemical polymerization strategy was simple, rapid, efficient, and applicable for diverse TA-derived monomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating Ligand Exchange Dynamics of Hexacyanochromate&#8208;Based Redox Mediators in Aqueous Iron&#8208;Chromium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange between cyanide and hydroxide in hexacyanochromate negolyte was caused by the disruption of coordination environment of the redox mediator ([Cr(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8722;), with a critical factor as an elevated pH during electrochemical cycle. To mitigate this electrolyte co&#8208;modulation strategy is introduced, optimizing the [OH&#8722;]/[CN&#8722;] ratios stabilize the redox mediator, ensuring long&#8208;term electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aqueous redox flow batteries (AQRFBs) are revolutionizing energy storage by integrating sustainability with cutting&#8208;edge innovation. Among them, Iron&#8208;Chromium RFBs (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low&#8208;cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K3[Cr(CN)6]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long&#8208;term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%&#8211;77%. This research provides valuable insights into the degradation pathways of hexacyanochromate&#8208;based negolyte and emphasizes the importance of optimized electrolyte design for advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Chromium Catalysis for Tunable Z/E Selectivity in Asymmetric Homoallylic Alcohol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a novel chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem&#8208;dichlorides with aldehydes that allows for the precise and tunable control over regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and Z/E&#8208;selectivity in the synthesis of chiral homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z&#8208;alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E&#8208;alkenes.








Abstract
Chiral homoallylic alcohols with vicinal stereocenters and well&#8208;defined Z/E alkene geometries are key structural motifs in bioactive polyketides, yet their efficient and selective synthesis remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Existing strategies often require preformed organometallic reagents or separate catalytic systems to access different alkene geometries, limiting synthetic efficiency and versatility. Herein, we report a chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem&#8208;dichlorides with aldehydes, enabling precise and tunable control over regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and Z/E&#8208;selectivity. This radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy circumvents the need for preformed organometallic reagents, offering a direct and modular approach to stereochemically complex homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z&#8208;alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E&#8208;alkenes, achieving excellent stereocontrol across a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies support a chromium&#8208;mediated allyl radical generation and addition pathway. This work establishes a versatile platform for constructing stereochemically defined homoallylic alcohols and expands the synthetic utility of allyl gem&#8208;dichlorides in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Quantum Chemistry Calculation&#8208;Assisted Large&#8208;Scale Collision Cross Section Prediction Empowers Derivatization&#8208;Enhanced Multidimensional Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurately predicting the large&#8208;scale properties of derivatized metabolites without relying on standards is a major challenge. We propose a quantum chemistry calculation&#8208;assisted strategy applicable to the accurate prediction of the collision cross section of derivatized metabolites, enabling high&#8208;coverage multidimensional isomer&#8208;level sterolomics that quantitatively revealed the tissue&#8208;specific distribution patterns of sterol lipids.








Abstract
Derivatization&#8208;enhanced multidimensional metabolomics combined with ion mobility mass spectrometry will greatly improve the accuracy and coverage of metabolic analysis. However, accurate prediction of the large&#8208;scale collision cross section (CCS) of derivatized metabolites without relying on standards and the establishment of multidimensional analytical methods faces great challenges. Here, we propose quantum chemistry calculation&#8208;assisted machine learning strategies applicable to the accurate prediction of the CCS of derivatized sterols, develop C&#9552;C bond&#8208;targeted N&#8208;Me derivatization methods for unsaturated sterols, and create a large&#8208;scale, 4D information database of derivatized sterol lipids (n&#160;=&#160;4891) by combining retention time and fragment ion prediction. Furthermore, a high&#8208;coverage unsaturated sterolomics at the isomer level was established on this basis, which quantitatively revealed the tissue&#8208;specific distribution patterns of over 100 sterol lipids. This study provides a key foundation for derivatization&#8208;enhanced metabolomics and provides important techniques and information for metabolic and functional studies of sterols.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Redox&#8208;Active Hyperbranched Polymers for Flow Batteries: Harnessing Self&#8208;Condensing Vinyl Copolymerization by Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized well&#8208;defined redox&#8208;active hyperbranched copolymers as active materials for redox flow batteries. The spatial sieving effect in the coil reactors enabled low dispersity of &lt;1.2 in the self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. These copolymers showed enhanced electrode reactions and inhibited crossover. Consequently, the redox flow battery equipped with low&#8208;cost dialysis membrane showed extended cycling life.








Abstract
The increased adoption of renewable power necessitates the development of grid&#8208;scale storage solutions, with aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) at the forefront. Despite their potential, performance limitations arising from high solution viscosity at high concentrations of active material and rapid degradation due to active material crossover continue to pose challenges. Here, we use flow chemistry to create redox&#8208;active hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs), which exhibited substantially improved suppression of crossover and enhanced rheology behaviors. The distinct reaction dynamics of flow chemistry facilitated the efficient and monomer&#8208;independent control over self&#8208;condensing vinyl polymerization, yielding well&#8208;defined HBCs with remarkably low dispersity. This strategy effectively enhanced the uniformity of the redox&#8208;active HBCs, leading to significantly reduced crossover and accelerated diffusion rates. The RFBs equipped with our redox&#8208;active HBCs exhibited long&#8208;term stability, mapping a pathway towards practical application of polymer&#8208;based technologies as well as highlighting the unique advantages of the flow chemistry techniques in high&#8208;precision electrolyte design.

         <title>Strain Energy Prompted Tunable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Property of Tetraphenylethylene</title>

A novel strategy employing strain energy of CPP on tetraphenylethylene (TPE), controlling the accessibility of conical intersection (CI) and thereby tuning the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property of TPE. This study offers new avenues for designing AIE molecules.








Abstract
Organic molecules exhibiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional solid&#8208;state luminescent properties. Understanding the AIE mechanism has been a focal point of both theoretical and experimental research. While conical intersection (CI) dynamics on potential energy surfaces (PESs) have emerged as a key factor in elucidating the AIE mechanism, modulating the accessibility to CI to regulate the non&#8208;radiative decay pathways remains a substantial challenge. Here we propose a new strategy leveraging strain energy introduced by cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to tune the AIE property of tetraphenylethylene (TPE). We synthesized and characterized a series of TPE&#8208;incorporated CPPs with varying sizes and endo/exo vinyl moieties. The photophysical properties and AIE behavior of these strained TPE&#8208;CPPs were meticulously examined. Endo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs exhibit AIE, while Exo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs do not, opposite to strain&#8208;free TPE macrocycles. The luminescence of Endo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs and Exo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs can be further tuned by adjusting the number of phenylene units in the loop. Their excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy. The strain energy induces structural distortion of TPE, stabilizing or elevating the transition state (TS), thereby regulating the accessibility to CI and enabling tunable AIE properties. These findings provide new insights for designing AIE molecules.

         <title>Bright Long&#8208;Wavelength Multi&#8208;State TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of bulky V&#8208;shaped donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor structure, alkyl chain engineering, and charge&#8208;transfer effect has been used to realize molecules with bright multi&#8208;state long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission. This approach led to a rigid dispersed&#8208;state conformation and twisted aggregate&#8208;state conformation with high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% and 53.50%, respectively.








Abstract
To achieve multi&#8208;state, visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited, long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high emission efficiency within a single molecular dye system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a series of V&#8208;shaped emitters comprising electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole and electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long&#8208;wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single&#8208;molecule and aggregate states. The V&#8208;shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited&#8208;state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single&#8208;molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V&#8208;shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate&#8208;state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration&#8208;independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment. This work paves the way for designing long&#8208;wavelength TADF materials with efficient multi&#8208;state emission.

         <title>Engineering Cavity and Aperture Binding Sites Within a Metal&#8211;Organic Cage for Up&#8208; and Down&#8208;Regulation of Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

Precisely controlling the up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of catalysis in a biomimetic fashion is a challenging goal in supramolecular chemistry. Here, the inclusion complex of Mo8O264&#8722; within a metal&#8211;organic cage 1 significantly enhances the catalytic performance of Mo8O264&#8722;. Binding of a secondary guest at the apertures of Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1 blocks access to Mo8O264&#8722; leading to catalytic inhibition.








Abstract
Engineering molecular recognition events into catalytic systems to precisely control the up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of catalysis in a biomimetic fashion is a challenging goal in supramolecular chemistry. In this work, we report on the construction of a new metal&#8211;organic cage, ZnII4L4 tetrahedron 1, using a protonated azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine&#8208;based ligand as the capping faces. The cage features a large cavity and wide gaps between its faces, enabling the simultaneous binding of anionic guests centrally and peripherally. Encapsulation of &#945;&#8208;Mo8O264&#8722; within the T&#8208;symmetric tetrahedron 1 leads to a C3&#8208;symmetric inclusion complex Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1. The apertures of Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1 act as secondary binding sites for accommodating tetraarylborate guests or for providing access to the included Mo8O264&#8722; for catalyzing reactions. Catalytic experiments demonstrated that inclusion within 1 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Mo8O264&#8722; for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides. In contrast, peripheral binding of the bulky tetraarylborate anion to the inclusion complex Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1 effectively inhibits its catalytic activity by obstructing access to the catalytic active sites of Mo8O264&#8722;.

         <title>Coordinating the Competitive Adsorption of Organic and OH&#8722; to Accelerate Electrooxidation Kinetics of Biomass&#8208;Derived Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the electrooxidation mechanism of biomass&#8208;derived nucleophiles is crucial to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts. This work demonstrated the direct oxidation pathway of the Co4N, CoO, and Co4N&#8211;CoO models for glycerol electrooxidation, elucidated the adsorption properties of OH&#8722; and glycerol, and highlighted the critical roles of adsorption balance between OH&#8722; and glycerol in enhancing the kinetics of glycerol electrooxidation.








Abstract
Elaborating electrooxidation mechanisms of biomass molecules on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrodes is crucial to designing high&#8208;performance active sites. Herein, we unveiled the direct oxidation mechanism of three electrode models, Co4N, CoO, and Co4N&#8211;CoO, in which the adsorptions of OH&#8722; and glycerol on the electrodes were competitive. The adsorption of glycerol on Co4N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH&#8722; species. The one&#8208;sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co4N and CoO. Constructing Co4N&#8211;CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one&#8208;sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH&#8722; and glycerol adsorptions on Co4N&#8211;CoO, the OH&#8722; was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high&#8208;valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co4N&#8211;CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co4N&#8211;CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120&#8208;h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co&#8208;adsorptions of OH&#8722; and organics on Co4N&#8211;CoO interfaces.

The adsorption of glycerol on Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species. The one-sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N and CoO. Constructing Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8211;CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one-sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and glycerol adsorptions on Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8211;CoO, the OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high-valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8211;CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8211;CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40&#160;mmol cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120-h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co-adsorptions of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and organics on Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8211;CoO interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of CDK12/13 and BRD4 Molecular Glue Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational design strategy for molecular glue degraders. By appending specific chemical gluing moieties to small molecule inhibitors, we successfully converted them into degraders without the need for a dedicated E3 ligase&#8208;binding motif. We found that introducing an aromatic ring or a double bond into a CDK12/13 inhibitor enabled the recruitment of the ubiquitination factor DDB1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that installing a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead onto a BRD4 inhibitor promotes DCAF16&#8208;dependent BRD4 degradation.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic approach for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;related proteins. While molecular glue degraders exhibit drug&#8208;like properties, their discovery has traditionally been serendipitous and often requires post hoc rationalization. In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism&#8208;guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage&#8208;binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead to a bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4&#8208;associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Discovery and Molecular Engineering Design for Enhancing Interface Stability of Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study leverages large language model and machine learning to identify and validate effective molecular candidates for stabilizing black phosphorus (BP) interfaces, achieving enhanced stability and introducing a synergistic molecular engineering strategy.








Abstract
Molecular engineering offers significant potential for developing advanced interfacial materials, yet the complexity of organic molecules poses challenges in discovering optimal structures. This study leveraged large language model (LLM) and machine learning (ML) to accelerate molecular discovery and guide molecular engineering for enhancing the stability of black phosphorus (BP), a promising 2D semiconductor but rapidly degrades when exposed to oxygen and moisture. By utilizing GPT&#8208;4o, molecular groups such as &#9472;SiR3, &#9472;PR2, &#9472;SH, and &#9552;NH that interact effectively with BP were identified and a high&#8208;throughput workflow employing graph neural networks (GNNs) models was developed to successfully predict and screen 662 promising candidates from over 117 million molecules. These candidates were validated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experiments, with synthesis protocols guided by GPT&#8208;4o, achieving great interfacial stabilization of BP for up to 24 days under ambient conditions. Furthermore, a new synergistic molecular engineering strategy was proposed by incorporating functional head, linker, and tail groups of molecules to even enable the use of hydrophilic molecules to stabilize BP surface, overcoming traditional design limitations. This work highlights the AI technologies not only in optimizing BP interfacial stability but also in broader aspects of molecular engineering for various materials.

         <title>Chirality Makes or Breaks Chemically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

Chirality&#8208;controlled reaction cycles: Reaction cycles are constructed to respond to the chirality (handedness) of an acylating agent. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed aminoacyl phosphate esters modulate the structure, lifetime, and transformation of transient (thio)ester intermediates, enabling control over distinct chemical pathways using molecules that are otherwise chemically identical.








Abstract
Nature has consistently selected homochiral building blocks from millions of possible diastereomers across diverse biomolecular structures to drive molecular recognition, catalysis and self&#8208;assembly. Despite its central role in biology, chirality's influence on chemically driven reaction networks remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self&#8208;assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)&#8208;esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self&#8208;assembly dynamics. Moreover, chirality regulates downstream reactivity in cascade reactions, where stereochemical control over an intermediate propagates into subsequent transformations. Finally, chiral acylating agents differentiate between two reaction cycles, selectively modulating one pathway while keeping another invariant &#8211; a level of control that remains difficult to achieve with conventional chemical strategies. Stereochemical programming enables control over reactivity and self&#8208;assembly, offering new opportunities to encode chirality in reaction networks and modulate their function through a single molecular parameter.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Color Switchable Luminescence in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Metal Halides via Local Polyhedron Regulation Under Light and Temperature Stimuli</title>

Schematic illustration of a series of Sb3+&#8208;containing PA3SbCl6, PA6InCl9, PMA4InCl7, PEA2InCl5&#183;H2O and PPA4InCl7 0D OIMHs with tunable yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange STE emission. The multi&#8208;response luminescence of PEA2InCl5&#183;H2O:Sb3+, PMA4InCl7:Sb3+ and PMA4InCl7:Sb3+/Bi3+ can be adjusted to show blue/green/yellow/orange emission by multimode regulation of temperature and excitation energy via local polyhedron regulation.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) with multi&#8208;color switchable luminescence have raised pervasive attention in the field of sensing, optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information encryption and storage. However, the complexity of soft lattice structures makes it difficult to establish design rules for realizing the luminescence regulation, which greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA3SbCl6, PA6InCl9, PMA4InCl7, PEA2InCl5&#183;H2O and PPA4InCl7. Tunable self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678&#160;nm originated from [SbCln]3&#8208;n are realized in these 0D structures by Sb3+ doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb3+&#8208;doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red&#8208;shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non&#8208;radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi&#8208;emission centers are constructed in Sb3+/Bi3+&#8208;doped PMA4InCl7, achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi&#8208;color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi&#8208;color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi&#8208;color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns2 ions, providing a new design perspective for low&#8208;dimensional OIMHs.

Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, PA&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, PMA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and PPA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Tunable self-trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678&#160;nm originated from [SbCl&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3-n&lt;/sup&gt; are realized in these 0D structures by Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red-shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non-radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi-emission centers are constructed in Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped PMA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi-color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi-color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti-counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi-color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ions, providing a new design perspective for low-dimensional OIMHs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Repertoire of Photoswitchable Unnatural Amino Acids for Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme engineering with photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (psUAAs) has a high potential for applications such as biocatalysis. Here, we extend the current repertoire of psUAAs to include more versatile properties paving the way to more advanced photocontrol engineering. We report on the synthesis and photochemical behavior, suitable aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for co&#8208;translational incorporation and initial enzymatic studies of these psUAAs.








Abstract
Photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (psUAAs) play a crucial role in the engineering of light&#8208;sensitivity in enzymes, which holds significant promise for diverse applications such as biotherapy and biocatalysis. Besides near&#8208;quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co&#8208;translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase&#8208;psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.

         <title>Molecular Rotor&#8208;Based NIR&#8208;II TICTgens for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Pyroptosis Induction and Multi&#8208;Model Monitoring of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) were designed for precisely regulating and in&#8208;situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic response to viscosity with superior sensitivity. Furthermore, HCM could generate dual type&#8208;I/II photodynamic and photothermal effects upon laser irradiation, which selectively induced mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent pyroptosis. In combination with acidity&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles, a versatile theragnostic platform for precise pyroptosis induction and in&#8208;situ evaluation of cancer immunotherapy was developed.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has emerged as a promising mechanism for eliciting robust antitumor immunity; however, the current pyroptosis inducers lack tumor&#8208;selectivity and feedback of therapeutic effect. In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671&#160;nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type&#8208;I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis&#8208;driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Unsaturated Phosphine Oxides for Modular Antibody Rebridging and Single Reagent Peptide&#8208;Cyclization&#8208;Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the modular synthesis of unsaturated P5 reagents starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide via CuAAC. Diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides enable rapid, selective and stable antibody disulfide rebridging, exemplified by the generation of a potent and selective ADC. In addition, triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide enables a unique single reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol to access functional cyclic&#8208;peptide protein conjugates.








Abstract
Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals, especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo&#8208;[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.

         <title>Distinct Charge Transport and its Regulation in Single&#8208;Molecule and Monolayer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208; and voltage&#8208;dependent transport mechanisms of single&#8208;molecule junctions and monolayer junctions are elucidated, highlighting the distinct influences of molecular vibrations and the orientation of the electric field on charge transport.








Abstract
As electronic devices miniaturize to the nanometer scale, molecular junctions, including single and monolayer molecules, are gaining attention for applications in logic, storage, and sensing. However, comparative studies of charge transport in these two junction types are limited. Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single&#8208;molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature&#8208;independent coherent tunneling to temperature&#8208;dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration&#8208;mediated transport, while vibration&#8208;suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields. These findings enrich our understanding of molecular electronic transport and pave the way for diverse developments in the field of molecular electronic devices.

By transforming a U&#8208;shaped charge&#8208;transfer (3CT)&#8208;featured D&#8211;A phosphor scaffold, which exhibits a long lifetime (&#964;Ph) but low efficiency (&#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$), into a V&#8208;shaped configuration, charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208;based organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (3CT&#8208;RTP) compounds with retained long &#964;Ph but significantly enhanced &#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$ are achieved, establishing a rational design strategy for high&#8208;performance 3CT&#8208;RTP materials.








Abstract
The realization of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;based organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (3CT&#8208;RTP, &#964;Ph&#160;= 210&#160;ms) via the construction of U&#8208;shaped donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) dyads is impeded by suboptimal phosphorescence efficiency (&#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$&#160;=&#160;6%). Herein, we reveal that modifying the skeleton of D&#8211;A dyads from U&#8208;shaped to V&#8208;shaped configurations yields 3CT&#8208;RTP with both long &#964;Ph (150&#8211;220&#160;ms) and high &#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$ (13%&#8211;25%). This improvement stems from preserving a substantial degree of forbiddenness in the radiative transition process of the compound while simultaneously increasing its D&#8211;A dihedral angle, which can promote more efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and thus more rapid intersystem crossing. Additionally, augmenting the framework rigidity of a V&#8208;shaped D&#8211;A dyad can potentially reduce the non&#8208;radiative transition rate constant of triplet excitons (knr,T), thereby facilitating the attainment of long &#964;Ph and high &#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$.

         <title>Unbiased Stable Photoelectrochemical Glycerol Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unbiased integrated system for photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction was designed by coupling the NiFeB/Ge/Zr&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)&#8208;NC cathode, showing a current density of &#8764;1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#160;h operation with a formate selectivity of &#8764;80%.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (PEC GOR) is considered as one of the promising strategies for obtaining high&#8208;value products and transforming solar energy to hydrogen. Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co&#8208;doped Fe2O3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co&#8208;doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co&#8208;catalyst promotes the cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)&#8208;NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of &#8764;1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with continuously operation of 100&#160;h. The bias&#8208;free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&#8722;2, representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high&#8208;value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization. This work provides new avenues for the sustainable solar&#8208;powered chemical synthesis of unbiased PEC systems with high selectivity and durability.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces redox&#8208;switchable poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs) based on dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene, whose reduction leads to planarisation, &#960;$\upi$&#8208;system extension, and weakened Lewis acidity, enabling controlled guest release. The reversible switching of these PLAs and their coordination polymers highlights their potential for applications in catalysis, electronics, and functional materials.








Abstract
Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox&#8208;active dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs can be planarised by a two&#8208;electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc&#8208;XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;$\upi$&#8208;systems. This &#960;$\upi$&#8208;system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#9472;P coordination polymer. sc&#8208;XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrochemical Reconstruction of Copper Single&#8208;Sites to Dual&#8208;Sites for Ambient Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated copper single&#8208;atom catalyst was found to occur in situ electrochemical reconstruction from Cu&#8211;N3 single&#8208;sites to N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites during ambient electrosynthesis of urea. The in&#8208;situ electrochemically formed N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites as catalytic active centers efficiently enhanced the generation of *CO and *NH intermediates and the formation of *CONH, thus facilitating C&#8211;N coupling to urea.








Abstract
Understanding and uncovering really catalytic active&#8208;sites during electrocatalysis is vital for carbon&#8211;nitrogen coupling reaction to synthesize urea. Here, we report a Copper (Cu) single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu&#8208;N3 SAs) with a Cu&#8211;N3 coordination structure for the electrochemical coreduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; into urea. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the Cu&#8211;N3 configured single&#8208;sites undergo electrochemically structural reconstruction to form N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites in Cu&#8211;N3 SAs, exhibiting efficient urea synthesis performance. The in&#8208;situ spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry confirms that the initial C&#8211;N coupling reaction involves the formation of *CONH from *CO and *NH intermediates generated via the coreduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; on the N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites. The in&#8208;situ electrochemical formed Cu dual&#8208;sites not only enhance the adsorption of *CO, but also facilitates the multi&#8208;electron transfer processes with lowered energy barrier for the formation of *CONH intermediates.

The in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the Cu&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; configured single-sites undergo electrochemically structural reconstruction to form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual-sites in Cu&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SAs, exhibiting efficient urea synthesis performance. The in-situ spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry confirms that the initial C&#8211;N coupling reaction involves the formation of *CONH from *CO and *NH intermediates generated via the coreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual-sites. The in-situ electrochemical formed Cu dual-sites not only enhance the adsorption of *CO, but also facilitates the multi-electron transfer processes with lowered energy barrier for the formation of *CONH intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activation of a Secondary&#8208;Messenger Receptor via Allosteric Modulation of a Dynamic Conformational Ensemble</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically disordered loops within globular protein domains have long escaped structural biology. Here, S&#246;ldner et&#160;al. show that despite this disorder, an allosteric modulation is exerted in a secondary&#8208;messenger receptor by binding of its secondary messenger. This effectively reorients the conformational ensemble of its binding interfaces without abrogating their high degree of dynamics.








Abstract
Bacterial signaling cascades have recently become of great relevance in the context of bacterial antibiotics resistance. Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP) is a key bacterial secondary messenger involved in growth, biofilm formation, virulence gene expression and others. The activation mechanisms of c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP receptors like the trimeric PII&#8208;like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger&#8208;bound forms of the 44&#160;kDa homotrimeric PII&#8208;like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core. The orchestration of the spatial properties of the loops, despite their retained internal dynamics, reveals the importance of allosteric effects even for disordered structural elements, whose steerable ensemble properties have long escaped the classical structural&#8208;biology understanding.

         <title>Exo&#8208;Selective Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions to Trans&#8208;Fused Perhydroazulenes: An Asymmetric Formal Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Pseudolaric Acid B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an asymmetric formal synthesis of pseudolaric acid B, for which we developed a new family of substrates with an epoxide geminally tethered to a sidechain bearing a furan, which undergoes a TESOTf&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition to yield the trans&#8208;fused perhydroazulene core and the requisite quaternary stereocenter of the natural product. The cycloaddition shows exquisite exo diastereoselectivity, as opposed to previous related cycloadditions of substrates with vicinally tethered epoxides. 








Abstract
We present an asymmetric formal total synthesis of pseudolaric acid B (PAB), based on the intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition of a new class of epoxy enolsilane substrates. This substrate type has the epoxide geminally&#8208;substituted on the tether to the furan, which reacts to yield the trans&#8208;fused perhydroazulene core of PAB containing the quaternary stereocenter. The reaction is highly diastereoselective, as opposed to cycloadditions of previous substrate types that generate the perhydroazulene framework. The role of the geminal tether in controlling the transition state conformation and the exo&#8208;selectivity is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Using this intramolecular cycloaddition as the key reaction, together with several one&#8208;pot sequences, a key intermediate in Trost's synthesis of PAB was accomplished, representing the shortest asymmetric synthesis of this anti&#8208;tumor natural product thus far.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Continuous Flow Electroselenocyclisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pass, continuous&#8208;flow electrolysis strategy &#8211; finely tuned by electrolyte choice &#8211; unlocks regiodivergent electroselenocyclisations of diselenides and oximes. By selectively guiding radical or ionic pathways through controlled substrate activation, this method enables a sustainable and highly selective synthesis of seleno&#8208;functionalised isoquinoline and isoindole N&#8208;oxides, expanding the toolbox for heterocyclic scaffold synthesis in green chemistry.








Abstract
Supporting electrolytes, beyond traditionally serving as ionic conductors in electrochemistry, can influence regioselectivity in electrochemical synthesis by acting as base. We present a single&#8208;pass continuous flow electrolysis method enabling selective activation of diselenides and oximes to access seleno&#8208;substituted isoquinoline and isoindole derivatives. Mechanistic studies showed a radical pathway via iminoxyl radicals to isoindole N&#8208;oxides and an ionic mechanism leading to isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides. This process leverages N&#8208;activated neutral isoquinolinium products for diverse downstream modifications. Our findings highlight the untapped potential of supporting electrolytes in regiodivergent electrochemical transformations and provide a sustainable and scalable platform for continuous flow approaches for synthesising selenium&#8208;containing heterocycles with biological relevance.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical confinement strategy combined spatial confinement at nanoscale and strong anchoring effect at atomic scale, enabling the precise synthesis of sub&#8208;nano sized cluster as ideal electrocatalyst materials. These sub&#8208;Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER).








Abstract
The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (&#8764;1&#160;nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub&#8208;nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.

NMR and MRI are crucial in sciences, but their low sensitivity limits their use. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) offers a solution. This study explores structure&#8208;photo&#8208;CIDNP relationships in liquid&#8208;state NMR using biomimetic tryptophan&#8211;flavin diads with varying oligoproline linker lengths. Findings show significant hyperpolarization effects, especially in diads with six proline units. Insights from this work pave the way for advanced NMR and bio&#8208;MRI studies.








Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential tools in natural and life sciences, but their low sensitivity often hampers their applicability. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) offers a versatile and mild method to overcome this limitation. Here, we report on structure&#8208;photo&#8208;CIDNP relationship studies in liquid&#8208;state NMR utilizing a holistic approach. We synthesized biomimetic tryptophan&#8211;flavin diads with varying linker lengths composed of conformationally rigid oligoproline units. The predominant polyproline II (PPII) helical structure ensures consistent donor&#8211;acceptor distances. Photo&#8208;CIDNP NMR experiments revealed significant hyperpolarization effects, particularly in diads with six proline units, mimicking the spatial arrangement found in natural photoactive proteins. Our findings highlight the potential of these biomimetic diads to enhance nuclear hyperpolarization in NMR spectroscopy. This work provides valuable insights into the design of diads for efficient photo&#8208;CIDNP generation, paving the way for advanced studies in modern NMR and bio&#8208;MRI.

         <title>Radical Borylation of Alkyl Bromides by Photoinduced Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced borylation of alkyl bromides via halogen atom transfer is reported. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with broad functional group tolerance in the borylation of various primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides. Computational studies provide mechanistic insights into the radical&#8208;chain pathway.








Abstract
Alkyl organoboron compounds are versatile synthons in organic synthesis, enabling rapid access to a variety of carbon&#9472;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. As such, strategies to efficiently access carbon&#8208;boron bonds from simple chemical feedstocks are highly desirable. The radical borylation of alkyl bromides presents an attractive approach. However, the activation of alkyl bromides typically requires strong reductants or transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free radical borylation strategy of various alkyl bromides utilizing a photoinduced silyl radical to mediate a halogen&#8208;atom transfer process. This method demonstrates broad utility and functional group tolerance among various primary, secondary, and tertiary unactivated alkyl bromides and can facilitate the functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Mechanistic and computational studies support a radical&#8208;chain pathway involving a silyl radical&#8208;mediated halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Hydrophobic Poly(divinylbenzene) Polymer&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Catalysts for Efficient Hydrogenation of Pyridines in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the pyridine hydrogenation in water is greatly enhanced over the hydrophobic Ru/PDVB catalyst, where nanopores in the PDVB are empty for hydrogen storage, enabling the enrichment of abundant hydrogen around active Ru sites for hydrogenation. 








Abstract
Gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid triphase reactions are limited by poor gas solubility and mass transfer, especially in water. The low solubility of hydrogen in water severely hinders the hydrogenation, therefore requiring high temperature and pressure to increase the activity, which have safety and cost concerns. Herein, we report a hydrophobic poly(divinylbenzene) polymer&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticle catalyst (Ru/PDVB) with both high activity and excellent stability for the hydrogenation of pyridines in water, even at ambient hydrogen pressure (0.1&#160;MPa). The average turnover frequency (ATOF) of the Ru/PDVB (836.8&#160;mol molRu&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) is about 6.0 and 768.0&#8208;fold higher than those of traditional Ru/C and commercial Raney Ni catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrophobic polymer prevents filling of water in the nanopores of PDVB, allowing hydrogen enrichment to boost the hydrogenation. This work provides an opportunity to improve the efficiency of industrially important reactions that suffer from poor gas solubility and mass transfer.

         <title>Metallic Ni as Electron Acceptor Modulates the Redox of Catalytic Centers at Activated Ni0/Ni(OH)2 Heterojunctions for Efficient Ethanol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni0/Ni2+ heterostructure formed via hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic surface tuning during electrodeposition. The heterostructure enhances Ni2+ &#8660; Ni3+ conversion, reduces kinetic barriers for acetaldehyde oxidation, and boosts ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;acetate efficiency. This dual&#8208;purpose approach combines hydrogen production with value&#8208;added products, offering an economical alternative for oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The coproduction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added acetate and hydrogen fuel by ethanol&#8208;assisted water electrolysis is significant, but the efficiency of ethanol electrooxidation (EOR) is hindered both by sluggish kinetics, primarily dictated by the redox properties of the catalyst. Therefore, the development of efficient EOR electrocatalysts has to target optimized redox properties. Herein, a Ni0/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure was synthesized by inducing a shift from hydrophilic to hydrophobic properties on the electrode surface during electrochemical deposition. The electrocatalyst enabled a current density of 573.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.37&#160;V versus RHE for EOR with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 14.4% when coupled to a commercial solar panel. Experimental and theoretical results disclosed that the incorporation of Ni0 facilitates the ethanol to acetate kinetics through enhanced Ni2+ to Ni3+ conversion. The strategy, combining hydrogen production with the synthesis of value&#8208;added products, enhances economic viability compared to conventional water electrolysis, underscoring its promise for practical implementation.

         <title>A Weakly&#8208;Solvating Propylene Carbonate Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

In this article, we embark on a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) in Li+&#8208;PC interactions, which profoundly alters the compatibility of PC with graphite, allowing the practicality of PC&#8208;based electrolyte. Building on this, the pouch cells achieve extended cycling stability at high voltage and improved low&#8208;temperature capacity retention while elucidating the underlying mechanisms.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) require electrolytes compatible with high&#8208;voltage (&gt;4.3&#160;V) and low&#8208;temperature (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;&#176;C) operation, yet commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based systems remain constrained by intrinsic limitations including poor oxidation stability at cathode side and high melting points. Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li+ within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC&#8208;based weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic&#8208;dominated cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4&#160;V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li+&#8208;PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8&#8211;4.4&#160;V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, surpassing conventional EC&#8208;based electrolytes. This work presents an electrolyte engineering approach that synergistically addresses high&#8208;voltage durability and low&#8208;temperature functionality, providing a scalable solution for advanced LIB technologies.

We propose a PC-based weakly-solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic-dominated cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4&#160;V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8&#8211;4.4&#160;V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, surpassing conventional EC-based electrolytes. This work presents an electrolyte engineering approach that synergistically addresses high-voltage durability and low-temperature functionality, providing a scalable solution for advanced LIB technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Migratory Insertion in a Bismuth Redox Platform: Reductive Arylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a multicomponent reaction involving an aryl halide, an aldehyde, and a silane derivative, facilitated by low&#8208;valent bismuth redox catalysis under mild conditions. The protocol represents an unprecedented example of four elementary organometallic steps at a Bi center within the catalytic cycle. Experimental and computational studies indicate the involvement of intermediate species that supports a Bi(I)/Bi(III) cycle.








Abstract
Herein, we report a catalytic defluorinative arylation of aldehydes with (per) A fluoroarenes facilitated by a pincer&#8208;based PheBox&#8208;Bi(I) under mild conditions. The protocol features various novel aspects in bismuth redox catalysis; namely, (1) a catalytic 1,2&#8208;aryl migratory insertion to forge a C&#9472;C bond, (2) an unprecedented example of multicomponent reaction through four elementary organometallic steps at a Bi center, (3) an unusual strategy for Bi(I) compounds regeneration via O&#9472;Si reductive elimination. Experimental and computational studies aided in dissecting the various mechanistic aspects of the bismuth redox cycle.

         <title>Electronic Cloud Topology&#8208;Driven Electrostatic Decoupling: To Suppress High&#8208;Voltage Parasitic Reactions of Phosphate Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital coupling induces coupled redox behavior, causing structural changes and triggering parasitic self&#8208;reduction and high&#8208;voltage irreversibility. The electrostatic field decoupling strategy modulates TM&#9472;O bond covalency with electron cloud distribution, adjusts the V t2g&#8211;Mn eg orbital gap, expands the Mn/V redox window, suppresses coupled reactions, and activates high&#8208;voltage Mn4+/3+ and V5+/4+ redox pairs. As a result, the NMVTP cathode achieves high reversible capacity, surpassing the two&#8208;electron transfer limit.








Abstract
The polyanionic structure cathodes with synergistic Mn/V redox couples enables high&#8208;voltage platform and delivers considerable theoretical energy density in sodium&#8208;ion battery. However, achieving stable and reversible high&#8208;voltage redox reactions remain challenging due to the inactivation of redox couples during discharge. Herein, we found that coupled redox behavior triggered by orbitals with similar energy levels leads to high&#8208;voltage irreversibility and parasitic reactions. To overcome this, we propose a strategy of adjusting the electron cloud topology by altering the electrostatic field, thereby changing the orbital energy gap between the t2g state of V and the eg state of Mn, effectively decoupling the electrochemical reactions. As a model system, the Na3.5MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high&#8208;voltage Mn4+/3+ and V5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. This strategy opens new paths for developing high&#8208;energy density batteries through orbital bandgap modification.

         <title>Chiral Induction and Memory via Supramolecular Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The helical chirality of a dynamic crown&#8208;ether switch can, by light&#8208; or redox&#8208;switching to a prochiral state, be erased and subsequently stereoselectively re&#8208;formed by relaxation in the presence of a point&#8208;chiral ammonium guest. This unique supramolecular deracemization enables facile transfer and stable memory of chiral information.








Abstract
Chirality is intrinsic to nature, and control of molecular chirality remains at the forefront of the chemical sciences. The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.

         <dc:description>
Herein, based upon a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) nano&#8208;generator of porphyrin&#8208;metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nano&#8208;reporter with luminescence caged by 1O2&#8208;cleavable quenchers, a singlet&#8208;oxygen activated up&#8208;conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) was developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single&#8208;step, no&#8208;wash format for digital protein detection with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto&#8208;molar detection limit.








Abstract
New diagnostic tools for accurately detecting extremely low levels of protein biomarkers in the bloodstream are essential for a wide range of clinical applications. We develop a singlet&#8208;oxygen activated up&#8208;conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) nanogenerator of porphyrin&#8208;metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1O2&#8208;cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1O2&#8208;generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1O2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single&#8208;molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single&#8208;step, no&#8208;wash format for digital protein detection with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto&#8208;molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Synergistic Light&#8208;Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production by Hydrogen Iodide Decomposition Over Dual&#8208;Molecular Ferroelectric Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

A dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunction [(4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4/(4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4], synthesized via a simple one&#8208;pot method, achieves a high H&#8322; evolution rate of 5.26&#160;mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under light and ultrasound, significantly outperforming its individual components. Polarization&#8208;coupled energy&#8208;level alignment and Pb&#8208;I bond&#8208;driven charge transfer enhance directional carrier migration and suppress recombination.








Abstract
Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi&#8208;field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one&#8208;pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4&#8208;difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4/(4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light &#8208;ultrasonic activation. Under dual&#8208;field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4 and (4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy&#8208;level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency piezo&#8208;photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next&#8208;generation solar&#8208;driven catalysts.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: A New Type of Porous Organic Solid Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid bases are important reagents widely used in both fundamental research and industry applications. Here, we developed a new type of porous organic solid base via self&#8208;assembly of deprotonated monomers. The basicity was confirmed by in situ DRIFTS and measured by titration, while the proton&#8208;induced structural transformation was clearly revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The abundant basic sites and inherent porosity make solid bases as a new type of catalysts with excellent catalytic activity.








Abstract
Solid base offers advantages in terms of the ease of handling, environmentally sustainable processes, and tunable interfacial properties. Despite of these benefits, the exploration of new solid bases remains challenging and is an underdeveloped area of research. In this work, we report the discovery of the inherent basicity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid&#8208;base neutralization reaction through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base&#8208;catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity. This study enriches the solid&#8208;base family by introducing a type of materials featured with high porosity, high crystallinity, and modular structure.

         <title>From Triplet to Twist: The Photochemical E/Z&#8208;Isomerization Pathway of the Near&#8208;Infrared Photoswitch peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full photoisomerization mechanism of the all&#8208;red&#8208;light addressable peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) has been decoded. Theory and transient absorption spectroscopy show that both E&#8594;Z$E\rightarrow Z$ and Z&#8594;E$Z\rightarrow E$ switching proceed via the triplet state. Competing pathways differ: whereas E$E$&#8208;PAT shows a flat T1$T_1$ minimum, Z$Z$&#8208;PAT undergoes fast singlet deactivation. These insights explain PAT's efficient bidirectional switching and guide rational design.








Abstract
In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long&#8208;wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of &#960;$\pi$&#8208;extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared addressability. The excited&#8208;state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) and second&#8208;order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the T1$\mathsf {T_1}$ PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;$\pi$&#8208;system and peri&#8208;connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red&#8208;shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid&#8208;based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational&#160;way.

         <title>Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient C&#9472;S Coupling in Thioether Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first single&#8208;atom catalyst for C&#9472;S cross&#8208;coupling, featuring atomically dispersed Cu sites on mesoporous carbon nitride. The catalyst enables efficient, selective, and recyclable thioether synthesis under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst resists sulfur poisoning and operates via a concerted, non&#8208;radical mechanism, enabling a novel, scalable, and sustainable method for pharmaceutically relevant thioethers.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions have become indispensable tools in synthetic chemistry. However, the formation of carbon&#8211;sulfur (C&#9472;S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C&#9472;S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur&#8208;induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single&#8208;atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C&#9472;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites. Combined with density functional theory simulations and radical scavenging experiments, our mechanistic investigations support a concerted oxidative addition pathway, which excludes radical intermediates. These results provide key insights into heterogeneous C&#9472;S coupling and demonstrate the power of single&#8208;atom catalysts in addressing long&#8208;standing challenges in sulfur chemistry, paving the way toward greener and more scalable processes for fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis.

         <title>Electrostatic Potential&#8208;Dominated Weak Solvation Chemistry for Synergistic Optimization of V2O5 Cathode and Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrostatic potential&#8208;dominated weakly solvated electrolyte system is designed by correlating molecular charge anisotropy with solvation thermodynamics and interfacial kinetics. Unlike traditional parameters, electrostatic potential guides atomic&#8208;level design, suppressing&#160;vanadium dissolution via reduced free water activity and inhibiting Zn dendrite deposition via interfacial stabilization. Consequengly,&#160;V2O5 cathode achieves enhanced&#160;capacity and stability, while&#160;Zn anode demonstrates superior high depth of discharge cycling, jointly advancing practical stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Practical aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries face severe challenges from cathodic dissolution and anodic dendrite growth. Herein, we report a novel electrostatic potential&#8208;dominated weakly solvated electrolyte that correlates molecular charge anisotropy with both solvation thermodynamics and interfacial passivation kinetics. By regulating the electrostatic force among Zn2+, H2O, and weak solvent, the attack ability of free water on vanadium oxide is efficiently reduced, and the vanadium dissolution is effectively prohibited. Simultaneously, the modified solvating structure induces a dense and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface, promoting uniform zinc deposition and suppressing side reactions. Benefiting from such synergistic optimization, the developed zinc&#8208;ion battery achieves a high capacity of 410 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintains 80% of the capacity after 650 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Stable Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with high energy density (138&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, based on electrode mass; 36.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, based on full cell) is also achieved, paving a promising way for practical applications.

         <title>Compact Ion&#8208;Pair Aggregates Dominated Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Performance Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By weakening Li&#8208;solvent interactions, an electrolyte with a solvation structure mainly composed of compact ion pairs aggregates (CIPAs) was constructed. This markedly improving lithium&#8208;ion transference numbers and reducing de&#8208;solvation energy barriers. Meanwhile, it induced robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI), enabling rapid interfacial lithium&#8208;ion transport even at extreme low temperatures, resulting in excellent low temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and environmental friendliness. However, at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, the operation of LIBs is constrained by degraded electrolyte ion transport performance and severe charge transfer polarization. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the construction of solvation structures dominated by compact ion&#8208;pair aggregates (CIPAs) through weak lithium&#8208;solvent interactions design, which significantly improved the lithium&#8208;ion transference number and reduced the de&#8208;solvation energy barrier. Excitingly, this strategy can induce the formation of a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface, thereby enabling the rapid transport of lithium ions across the interface even at extremely low temperatures. This electrolyte provides excellent electrochemical performance of practical natural graphite and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1 (NCM811) electrodes. The NCM811||graphite full cell exhibits capacity retention of 84.7% of its room temperature capacity at a high rate of 0.5C at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, and can be cycled stably for over 200 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C without obvious capacity degradation. This work presents an innovative avenue for high performance LIBs at low temperature.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Perovskite Heterojunction Photocatalytic Membrane with Efficient Proton Supply for Boosting CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H&#8208;bonded MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN/ECE photocatalytic membrane enhances CO2 methanation efficiency by enabling preferential hole oxidation of ECE (versus H2O) for proton supply, while its H&#8208;bond network accelerates proton transfer and strengthens *CO adsorption to boost CH4 production.








Abstract
Efficient proton supply and enhanced *CO intermediate adsorption are crucial strategies for boosting CO2 methanation. Herein, we construct a hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) photocatalytic membrane by integrating a MAPbBr3/cyano&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 (MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN) heterojunction with ethyl cellulose (ECE) binder through a simple sol&#8211;gel process, achieving significantly enhanced CO2 methanation efficiency. ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H2O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H&#8208;bonding between the &#8208;OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN, generating proton&#8208;rich interfaces and local H&#8208;bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction. Furthermore, the MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN/ECE membrane demonstrates exceptional recyclability through a re&#8208;crosslinking membrane formation process, effectively reactivating proton&#8208;supply sites while maintaining superior CH4 selectivity across multiple operational cycles.

         <title>A Novel Oxygen Vacancy in ScPO4:Er for Luminescence Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of the drastic luminescence thermal quenching seen in general cases, the deep VO in ScPO4 has been proved responsible for the significant luminescence anti&#8208;thermal quenching thanks to the perfectly matched energy levels of VO with 4S3/2/4F9/2 in doped&#160;Er3+, imparting the classic compound ScPO4 with unprecedented performances in thermophotovoltaics and dual&#8208;mode luminescence thermometers.








Abstract
Different from previously reported shallow defects in ScPO4, herein we have uncovered a deep defect, oxygen vacancy (VO). The perfect energy level match with 4S3/2/4F9/2 in doped Er3+ allows VO to accept and store the excitation energy transferred from Er3+, which is then released and back&#8208;transferred to Er3+ upon heating, and finally leads to significant luminescence anti&#8208;thermal quenching (LATQ). Moreover, the concentration of VO can be adjusted by simple atmospheric annealing, which allows modulation of VO &#8594; Er3+ energy transfer for adjustable LATQ in ScPO4:Er, i.e., downshifting LATQ up to 843&#160;K and upconversion LATQ till a record&#8208;high temperature of 1323&#160;K, and thus unparalleled performance of the classic compound ScPO4:Er in thermophotovoltaics (TPV) and dual&#8208;mode luminescence thermometers.

         <title>Multisite Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Facilitates Oxidative Photocatalysis in a Molecular Zr&#8208;Based Coordination Compound</title>

         <dc:description>
Deprotonation of the hydroxy ligand in the Zr3(O)(OH)3 nodes of a molecular cage unlocks photo&#8208;oxidative catalysis via multisite proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), complementing previous findings in the reductive counterpart. This platform offers valuable insights into the excited&#8208;state reactivity of photoredox catalysts and stands as a promising tool with unprecedented ambipolar reactivity for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
The development of mediators that harness visible light to drive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) offers a promising pathway to achieving challenging redox transformations in a more sustainable manner and with enhanced thermochemical efficiency. However, designing photocatalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant metals while gaining precise control over their excited&#8208;state reactivity remains a significant challenge. Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr&#8323;(O)(OH)&#8323; nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O&#9472;H and C&#9472;H bonds (70&#8211;100 kcal mol&#8315;1). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground&#8208;state, pre&#8208;association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedented ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.

         <title>Phase Transition&#8208;Induced Regulation of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Doping System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible switching between room temperature phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence is achieved through solid&#8208;liquid phase transitions in donor&#8208;acceptor systems, where tunable molecular conformation of the N&#8208;phenylphenoselenazine donor unit governs luminescence mode switching. This finding establishes a new approach for stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials.








Abstract
Switching between triplet&#8208;involved room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and delayed fluorescence (DF) is pivotal for advancing molecular encryption application but remains a significant challenge in multicomponent material systems. In this study, we successfully realized the selective modulation of RTP and DF emissions in a donor&#8208;acceptor doping system by inducing conformational changes in the donor through solid&#8208;liquid transition. In the solid state, the donor adopts a highly twisted quasi&#8208;axial conformation, which effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in efficient green RTP. In contrast, in the liquid state, the donor transitions to a relatively planar conformation, forming the intermolecular charge transfer state with the acceptor, significantly reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, thereby facilitating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and generating yellow DF. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple emissive triplet states demonstrates promising applications in information encryption, ink&#8208;free rewritable paper, and thermal sensing.

         <title>Metastable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;Meisenheimer Adduct</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetranitroazacalixarene captures cyanide reversibly via SNAr to form a metastable dianionic bis&#8208;Meisenheimer complex. Stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the dianionic adduct spontaneously regenerates the parent macrocycle under mild conditions. This dynamic, fuel&#8208;driven process can be finely tuned by the counterion, concentration, solvent, and temperature.








Abstract
An electron&#8208;deficient tetranitroazacalixarene is shown to undergo reversible cyanide capture via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, yielding an unprecedented class of metastable dianionic macrocycle incorporating two Meisenheimer units, fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.

         <title>Exciton Trapping at Shape&#8208;Persistent Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we disclose the photophysical properties of shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanotubes. We establish a structure&#8208;function correlation disentangling ring size and torsional angle for the first time in the study of exciton trapping. Red shifting fluorescence is observed as para&#8208;phenylenes are introduced into the nanotube. Density functional theory calculations correlate the emission redshift with structural relaxation of the lowest excited state. 








Abstract
We report a series of shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanotubes with top rim connectivity traversing from an all&#8208;meta&#8208; (m4) to an all&#8208;para&#8208;phenylene (p4) bridged species, including all possible members in between them. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data show a large torsional angle for meta&#8208;phenylenes relative to para&#8208;phenylene rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental torsional angles and also establish a correlation indicating a gradual increase in strain energy from m4 (&#8764;31&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) to p4 (&#8764;90&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Structural transitions from m4 to p4 lead to additional correlations such as a shift in the lowest absorption wavelength from 330 to 394&#160;nm, a sizeable red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from 444 to 546&#160;nm, and a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield from 0.76 to 0.20, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent (TD)&#8208;DFT analysis of the relaxed excited state (S1&#8217;) geometry shows a progression of exciton delocalization as para&#8208;phenylenes are introduced into m4 en route to p4, while the overall molecular size remains constant. This effect is directly related to increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the nanotube's top&#8208;segment and demonstrates how exciton trapping can take place without changing the nanotube's physical size, e.g., diameter and length.

         <title>Stabilizing Cu3+ Active Center by Intramolecular Electron Transfer for Boosting Complete Glucose Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional Cu sites typically facilitate only a two&#8208;electron transfer in glucose (Glu) oxidation, yielding gluconic acid (GNA) as the primary product. In this study, we achieved a stable Cu3&#8314; active center through an intramolecular electronic structure modulation strategy, enabling complete 24&#8208;electron transfer oxidation of Glu to CO2 and formate.








Abstract
The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro&#8208;conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single&#8208;atom Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high&#8208;valence Cu sites (CuO&#8208;MOF&#8208;Pt1), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the &#8211;CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron&#8208;withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu3+ active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C&#9472;C bond scission over CuO&#8208;MOF&#8208;Pt1, and a stable Cu3+ active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity.

     alt="Stabilizing Cu3+ Active Center by Intramolecular Electron Transfer for Boosting Complete Glucose Electrooxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional Cu sites typically facilitate only a two-electron transfer in glucose (Glu) oxidation, yielding gluconic acid (GNA) as the primary product. In this study, we achieved a stable Cu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; active center through an intramolecular electronic structure modulation strategy, enabling complete 24-electron transfer oxidation of Glu to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro-conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single-atom Pt-doped Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high-valence Cu sites (CuO-MOF-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the &#8211;CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron-withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C&#9472;C bond scission over CuO-MOF-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and a stable Cu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity. Notably, CuO-MOF-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; delivers comparable Glu sensing performance with a high sensitivity of 2.587&#160;mA&#160;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a low detection limit of 0.93&#160;&#181;M, and extraordinary durability. We further constructed a miniaturized CuO-MOF-Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-based sensor, enabling accurate detection of Glu in saliva. This work opens an inspiring avenue to the precise design of stable metal activity centers through electronic structure regulation for boosting Glu electrooxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Gourd&#8208;Vine Supramolecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Organic Cathode Through Dual&#8208;Mode of Anion Coordination and Conjugated Redox Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy to enhance structural stability and electrochemical performance of organic cathodes, which incorporates two synergistic design principles including the alkyl&#8208;based polymeric backbone and &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking to suppress solvation&#8208;driven degradation as well as the conjugated aryl groups to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox&#8208;active nitrogen sites.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic cathode materials feature multielectron redox activity, structural tunability, and elevated redox potentials, making them promising candidates for battery applications. Nevertheless, their practical deployment remains hindered by inherent challenges, particularly the persistent dissolution issue in conventional electrolytes, leading to rapid capacity fading. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy inspired by the hierarchical reinforcement observed in gourd&#8208;vine systems, which integrates two synergistic design principles. First, the alkyl&#8208;based polymeric backbone and &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking impose steric confinement to suppress solvation&#8208;driven degradation. Second, the conjugated aryl groups strategically are positioned on the phenazine scaffold to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox&#8208;active nitrogen sites. This approach not only endows the battery system with exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability but also enables high&#8208;capacity energy storage with sustained operational durability. The resultant 5,10&#8208;diaryl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine polymer cathode exemplifies this paradigm, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance including an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and an excellent capacity retention of 88% over 2000 cycles, representing one of the most robust performances reported for organic cathodes. Comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulations systematically elaborate a dual&#8208;mode charge compensation mechanism involving the reversible anion (de)coordination coupled with conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron redox activation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Site Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Microenvironment Regulation of Copper Nanoclusters with Atomic Precision for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of the single&#8208;site metal&#8208;nonmetal microenvironment was achieved using two structurally similar copper nanoclusters, offering insights into the development of high&#8208;performance cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with controlled photoluminescence and radioluminescence for downstream applications. 








Abstract
The intramolecular microenvironment regulation in metal nanoclusters has typically occurred with the same attribute factors&#8212;like metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand control&#8212;while the regulation with different&#8208;attribute factors, e.g., from metal to nonmetal, remains challenging, not to mention the different&#8208;attribute microenvironment regulation at the single&#8208;site level. Herein, we report the single&#8208;site metal&#8208;nonmetal microenvironment regulation of copper nanoclusters based on structurally comparable Cu10 and Cu11 nanoclusters with the same skeleton but different vacancy&#8208;filling elements. The quantum&#8208;size effects endow Cu10 and Cu11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non&#8208;radiative decay rate and weaker electron&#8208;phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu11&#8208;based film demonstrated effective X&#8208;ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials for X&#8208;ray imaging in the infrared region. This research highlights the potential for regulating different&#8208;attribute microenvironments in metal nanoclusters and provides an atomic&#8208;level understanding of how to modulate the photophysical properties of cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Improved Ionic Thermoelectric Performance of Adhesive and Self&#8208;Healing Cationic High&#8208;Entropy Gel Thermocell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabricated cationic high&#8208;entropy gel (CHEG) GFK&#8208;Na+&#8722;Li+&#8208;Gdm+&#8722;Cs+ exhibits good adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties. CHEG thermocell delivers the high ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) performance with Si&#160;=&#160;41&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 and Pmax/(&#8710;T)2&#160;=&#160;14.3&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 due to multi&#8208;ions interaction. The electricity produced by thermocell devices can electrocatalytically degrade water pollution. 








Abstract
Gel thermocell can directly convert heat into electricity by ions as energy carriers, capable of low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. However, ionic thermoelectric performance, including ionic thermopower, output power density, and energy density, needs to be significantly improved to meet practical applications. To date, it still lacks an effective strategy to focus on gels to achieve the overall high performance. Herein, an adhesive and self&#8208;healing cationic high&#8208;entropy gel (CHEG) G&#8208;FeCN4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;K+&#8208;Na+&#8208;Li+&#8208;Gdm+&#8208;Cs+ in a multi&#8208;ion cooperative chemical environment has been designed by the interaction between multications and anions, improving the entropy change of redox reaction, exchange current density, and ionic conductivity, thereby achieving an overall high ionic thermoelectric performance. The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 with 2.3&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 and an energy density of 4.5&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2. In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high&#8208;performance ionic thermoelectric gels and provides a new application in water pollution treatments.

         <title>Experimentally Guided Iterative Parameter Estimation for Predictive Chemical Oscillator Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an iterative, experimentally guided parameter estimation method to improve the predictivity of chemical oscillator models. This method enables the efficient identification of sustained oscillations in the Fmoc oscillator across diverse conditions. Culminating in the development of a new oscillating system with a different amine at its core in only two iterations of parameter estimation followed by model prediction.








Abstract
Chemical oscillators are fundamental to dynamic processes in biology, from circadian rhythms to metabolic regulation, inspiring efforts to design synthetic analogues for use in responsive materials, autonomous systems, and molecular computing. However, creating robust and tunable synthetic oscillators remains a major challenge due to the inherent complexity and difficulty of identifying conditions that support sustained oscillations. We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time&#8208;efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.

         <title>Continuous Photocatalytic Acetylene Conversion to Ethylene in Liquid Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a continuous photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation approach that combines solvent absorption of acetylene with in situ photocatalytic transformation methods. This approach can address the technical bottlenecks of the solvent absorption method and simultaneously upgrade bulk acetylene into high&#8208;value&#8208;added ethylene. This study offers new routes for ethylene purification from petroleum line and ethylene production from coal&#8208;based process and opens up a new avenue for the development of photocatalytic alkyne hydrogenation technologies.








Abstract
Ethylene is a basic building block for polymer synthesis, but its purification from petroleum&#8208;based processes (e.g., thermo&#8208;catalytic acetylene hydrogenation) and its production from coal&#8208;based processes (e.g., Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis) normally require high temperature, high pressure, and gaseous hydrogen. Here, we report a continuous ethylene photosynthesis approach as a new platform technology that enables highly efficient and selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene in liquid under mild conditions. This platform technology is compatible with a wide range of solvents, catalysts, and hydrogen sources. Using Pd/mpg&#8208;C3N4 as the model photocatalyst, a complete conversion of acetylene was achieved with high ethylene selectivity (&gt;93%) under the continuous flow of either a pure acetylene stream or a crude ethylene stream containing acetylene impurity. The process performance remained stable for at least 72 h. Physical, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopy investigations showed that the photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation follows the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and atomic hydrogen&#8208;mediated indirect electron transfer pathways with proton as the hydrogen source. The technoeconomic analysis (TEA) demonstrated that this photocatalytic approach has large profitable margins for both ethylene purification and ethylene production processes. This study provides a green and sustainable technology for both petrochemical (ethylene purification) and coal&#8208;chemical (ethylene production) industries.

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Control of Covalent Organic Frameworks Through Repulsion&#8208;Torsion Effect: Prominent 1D Above 2D and 3D Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study for the first time synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through the repulsion&#8208;torsion effect. The charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D&#160;&gt;&#160;3D&#160;&gt;&#160;2D.








Abstract
Exploring the impact of different dimensions on the properties and functions of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has always been a key goal, as this can provide feedback to assist in the design of advanced COFs. However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one&#8208;dimensional (1D), two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion&#8208;torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion&#8208;torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non&#8208;planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion&#8208;torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D&#160;&gt;&#160;3D&#160;&gt;&#160;2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.

         <title>Controllable Preparation of Hierarchically Charge&#8208;Separated Interface to Effectively Promote the Desolvation and Kinetics of Lithium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

A novel BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode, fabricated by uniformly decorating black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) on graphdiyne nanotubes (GDYNTs), generates a charge&#8208;separated interface that in situ induces an inorganic&#8208;components&#8208;enriched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This SEI enhances Li&#8208;ion desolvation and kinetics, enabling the BPQDs/GDYNTs to achieve fast&#8208;charging capability and remarkable longevity of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is one of the key factors to determine the performance of batteries. Electrolyte additives enhance SEI performance for fast charging and long cycle life but introduce system&#8208;level uncertainties, including cathode degradation, safety hazards, and cost escalation. In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge&#8208;separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge&#8208;separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron&#8208;rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6&#8722;) on the electron&#8208;deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI containing fluorine&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li&#8208;ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li&#8208;ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast&#8208;charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance over 50&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g&#8722;1 with negligible capacity decay.

         <title>C&#9472;C Bond Formation via Reductive Elimination at Rare Earth Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

The reductive elimination, which is one of the most important and fundamental reactions in organometallic chemistry, has been achieved for RE complexes, opening up a new way for their application in synthetic chemistry.








Abstract
Reductive elimination is one of the most important elementary reactions employed for constructing various chemical bonds in transition metal complex&#8208;mediated transformations. However, due to the lack of two&#8208;electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (LNacnac&#8208;&#954;2N,N&#8242;)RE(III)(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) (1&#8208;RE, RE&#160;=&#160;Y, Er, Yb, and Lu; LNacnac = {[(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)NCMe]2CH}&#8722;) with azobenzene at ambient conditions, resulting in the formations of (LNacnac&#8208;&#954;2N,N&#8242;)RE(III)(&#951;2&#8208;cis&#8208;PhNNPh&#8722;&#8226;)2(THF) (2&#8208;RE) and 2&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]azobenzene (I) via a reductive elimination&#8208;powered pathway. The key intermediate (LNacnac&#8208;&#954;2N,N')Lu(III)(PhNNC6H5&#8208;&#954;2&#160;N,C)(CH2SiMe3) (3&#8208;Lu), which is formed via ortho&#8208;H deprotonation in azobenzene by the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group in 1&#8208;Lu, was isolated and structurally identified. The computational studies indicate that the subsequent &#951;2&#8208;coordination of a cis&#8208;azobenzene to the RE(III) centers in this intermediate triggers the reductive elimination between the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group and the neighboring PhNNC6H5&#8208;&#954;2N,C group, consequently enabling the C&#9472;C cross&#8208;coupling that affords product I. In this elementary process, the two N&#9552;N &#960;*&#8208;orbitals mainly act as the energetically accessible acceptors for the two electrons being transferred, thereby facilitating the reductive elimination by avoiding the thermodynamically unfavorable 2e&#8208;reductions of RE centers.

&lt;p&gt;The reductive elimination, which is one of the most important and fundamental reactions in organometallic chemistry, has been achieved for RE complexes, opening up a new way for their application in synthetic chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductive elimination is one of the most important elementary reactions employed for constructing various chemical bonds in transition metal complex-mediated transformations. However, due to the lack of two-electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-diketiminate-supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (L&lt;sup&gt;Nacnac&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Multisite Cooperative Regulation of Solvation and Interface via Dynamic Additive Engineering for Highly Reversible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional&#8208;group molecules (MGM) with folded configuration engage in multisite Zn2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active water molecules to suppress parasitic reactions, while their configuration transition to straight&#8208;chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)&#8208;facet&#8208;dominated Zn deposition. 








Abstract
Inexhaustible additives have been reported to enhance the reversibility of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the structure&#8211;performance relationship of additive molecules remains elusive, particularly regarding multisite coordination&#8208;mediated synergistic regulation of solvation and interface. Herein, a dynamic configuration reconstruction mechanism that orchestrates the multisite regulation of solvation and interface is unveiled by utilizing a series of polyhydroxy additive prototypes, demonstrating that the increase of functional groups and chain flexibility in multifunctional&#8208;group molecules (MGMs) contributes to boosting battery performance. MGM with folded configuration engages in multisite Zn2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active H2O molecule to suppress parasitic reactions, while its configuration transition to straight&#8208;chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)&#8208;facet&#8208;dominated Zn deposition. Remarkably, Zn//Zn cells achieve long cycle life of 7000&#160;h and subzero&#8208;temperature operation, and Zn//PANI pouch cell maintains nearly 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This work opens a fascinating avenue for developing high&#8208;performance batteries via dynamic additive engineering.

         <title>Triadic Electrophilic Centers Specifically Bind to SMO Transmembrane Domain to Inhibit the Hedgehog Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs containing triadic electrophilic centers (&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;X(&#948;+)&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;). Triadic electrophilic centers enhance the &#960;&#8208;cation lock between transmembrane peptide chains by binding to the SMO transmembrane region, thereby restricting SMO mobility and achieving efficient inhibition of SMO activity.








Abstract
Designing drugs to target overexpressed membrane protein smoothened (SMO) to selectively inhibit the Hedgehog signaling pathway represents a promising approach to achieving effective chemotherapy. Currently, only three organic small molecular inhibitors of SMO have been approved for clinically targeted therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs (RuSe, OsSe, RuIP, OsIP) containing triadic electrophilic centers (&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;X(&#948;+)&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;). In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that the designed triadic electrophilic center drugs could selectively inhibit the activity of SMO, blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and effectively killing tumors. Through theoretical calculations combined with experimental data, we verified that the interaction between the protein and drugs increases the polarization of the triadic electrophilic centers. The drugs utilize dual electrophilic centers to fix the binding and use the third electrophilic center insert to the swinging hinge region between TM5 and TM6 of the 7&#8208;transmembrane domain of SMO. This strengthens the &#960;&#8208;cation lock binding between the transmembrane peptide chains, ultimately inhibiting the mobility of the transmembrane peptide chains and thereby inhibiting SMO activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing SMO specific targeted drugs, offering new hope for clinically targeted therapies.

         <title>Multiresonant Framework&#8208;Perturbed Platinum(II) Complexes Enable Efficient Narrowband Red Phosphorescence Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for designing efficient narrowband red phosphorescent emitters is presented by orthogonal integration of boron&#8211;nitrogen multiple resonance (BN&#8208;MR) frameworks into tetradentate Pt(II) complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the BN&#8208;MR skeleton electronically perturbs the singlet excited state, thereby enhancing transition dipole moments and accelerating radiative decay rates.








Abstract
While considerable research efforts have been devoted to developing narrowband B,N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (BN&#8208;MR) emitters, despite the formidable challenge, the design of efficient narrowband red phosphors has been overlooked. Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN&#8208;MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN&#8208;PyPt and DPABN&#8208;PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN&#8208;PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 35&#160;nm/0.118&#160;eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2&#160;&#181;s (compared to 7.6&#160;&#181;s for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL) of 75% in doped films&#8211;representing a 4.4&#8208;fold enhancement over PhPyPt (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;17%). Theoretical investigations reveal that the BN&#8208;MR skeleton induces significant electronic perturbation of the singlet state, leading to enhanced transition dipole moments and accelerated radiative decay (kr&#160;=&#160;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 versus 0.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 for PhPyPt). In optimized OLED devices, BCzBN&#8208;PyPt achieves superior red narrowband electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.7%.

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Doping to Promote Structural Evolution of Metallic Iridium to Oxides on Platinum Nanowire Bundles for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>

Reducing Ir loading is critical for the Gigawatt&#8208;scale implementation of PEM water electrolyzers. Here, we report an ultra&#8208;low Ir anode architecture consisting of Re&#8208;doped Ir nanoparticles anchored at Pt nanowire networks. The Re dopant accelerates the electrochemical conversion of metallic Ir to active IrOx, while the Pt nanowire support enhances catalyst utilization and electron/mass transport. Both factors, at different scales, together contribute to the performance and durability improvements of a low Ir anode.








Abstract
The current high Ir loading (&#8764;2&#160;mgIr&#160;cm&#8722;2) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) severely hinders their applications for green hydrogen production. Reducing Ir loading while maintaining high performance and durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anode is critical for the Gigawatt&#8208;scale deployment of PEMWEs. Herein, we report an ultra&#8208;low Ir anode, consisting of Re&#8208;doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrOx during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three&#8208;electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts. The optimized Ir anode achieved a current density of 3.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at 1.69&#160;V (0.2&#160;mgIr cm&#8722;2) and 1.73&#160;V (0.1&#160;mgIr cm&#8722;2) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), exceeding the US DOE 2026 targets (0.5&#160;mgPGM cm&#8722;2 at 1.8&#160;V for 3.0 A cm&#8722;2). The corresponding MEAs also demonstrated compelling long&#8208;term durability, as evidenced by a low voltage degradation rate of 26&#160;&#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1100 hours of operation and 0.8&#160;&#181;V cycle&#8722;1 during an accelerated stress test.

         <title>Photosensitization&#8208;Controlled Dynamic Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic and controllable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent polymers are developed by integrating photosensitizers into the polymer matrix. Upon irradiation, the photosensitizer undergoes photosensitization, converting triplet oxygen into singlet oxygen within the polymer matrix. This process efficiently regulates the oxygen concentration surrounding the phosphorescent chromophores, enabling controllable photo&#8208;activated time and high&#8208;performance RTP.








Abstract
Dynamic organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have enabled potential applications in intelligent optoelectronics owing to their reversibly dynamic luminescence features. However, in most reported dynamic RTP materials, chromophores serve dual roles as phosphorescent emitters and oxygen sensitizers. This leads to uncontrollable dynamic processes and a reduction in phosphorescence performance. Herein, we present a strategy for achieving controllable dynamic RTP and maintaining the phosphorescent performance by integrating triplet photosensitizers into the RTP polymer. Specifically, by adjusting the concentration of the photosensitizer, the photoactivation time of the copolymers can be accurately controlled within the range of 3&#8211;30 s. Notably, after photoactivation, the phosphorescence lifetime of the polymer was prolonged from 558 to 1017 ms, which is longer than that of the polymer lacking a photosensitizer. The versatility of the design strategy was further validated by synthesizing a diverse range of RTP polymers through copolymerization and physical doping, as well as by employing alternative photosensitizers. Given the dynamic RTP feature, we demonstrated potential applications in dynamic intelligent afterglow displays and multilevel information encryption. This work advances the development of controllable dynamic RTP polymers and expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in intelligent optoelectronics.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis and Crystal Engineering of Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Carbonyl&#8208;Bridged Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid state packing of triphenylamine derivatives is modulated by the variation of aryl bridges, endowing a wide diversity of luminescence properties. Closely packed, parallel structures induce room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) dominated spectra with long RTP lifetimes (&#964;Ph), while nonparallel, more spaced motifs result in competitive fluorescence and shorter lifetimes.








Abstract
Organic materials with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are a growing research topic, with recent investigations revealing a strong effect of the crystal packing on the RTP properties. However, these relationships are difficult to decipher, as the crystal packing affects both the intermolecular interactions and the molecular conformation. Here, we report a divergent synthetic strategy to generate a family of rigid carbonyl&#8208;bridged triphenylamine (TPA)&#8208;based chromophores via metal&#8208;free transformations of the same starting material, and exploit this family to investigate the effects of crystal packing on the solid state RTP properties. The minor bridge modifications lead the TPA derivatives to adopt three distinct crystal packing motifs: parallel columnar stacks, antiparallel zigzags, and nonparallel dimerized arrangements. Despite the nearly identical RTP spectra across the series, the proportion of phosphorescence in their emission and the RTP lifetimes are shown to differ as a result of the different crystal motifs. Computational investigations of dimer models of the solid state reveal that the interplay between fluorescence and triplet formation can be modelled by identifying the aggregate character of dimers in the crystal, but only if pairs in multiple dimensions of the crystal are considered.

         <title>Cyclochlorotine Hydroxylase CctR Reveals DUF3328 as a Family of Copper&#8208;Dependent Metalloenzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
DUF3328 is an enigmatic enzyme family implicated in diverse transformations in fungal natural product biosynthesis, yet its functions remain largely underexplored. Through biochemical characterization of the cyclochlorotine hydroxylase CctR, we define DUF3328 as a family of copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes. This study reveals key structural and mechanistic features shared across the family.








Abstract
DUF3328 is a protein family widely found in fungal natural product biosynthesis pathways. Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C(sp3)&#9472;H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane&#8208;associated copper&#8208;dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four&#8208;helix coiled coil, and C&#8208;terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x)nHxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen&#8208;dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.

An acidic In&#9472;MnO2 battery with anion&#8208;regulated interfacial chemistry enables reversible deposition&#8211;dissolution at both electrodes. By optimizing Cl&#8722;/SO42&#8722; ratios and employing an anion&#8208;decoupled dual&#8208;electrolyte design, the system achieves stable operation at &#8764;1.7&#160;V over 1500 cycles. A Bi&#8208;based electrode&#8208;less anode further extends cycle life beyond 2000 cycles through in situ Indium (In) alloying, offering a robust strategy for advanced aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Acidic aqueous metal&#9472;MnO2 rechargeable batteries enable high&#8208;capacity energy storage via a two&#8208;electron MnO2/Mn2+ redox chemistry but suffer from severe anode corrosion and poor reversibility in acidic environments.&#160;Here, we report an acidic In&#9472;MnO2 battery (IMB) system that employs anion&#8208;regulated interfacial chemistry to enable reversible deposition&#8211;dissolution reactions at both electrodes. The In3+/In redox couple offers a favorable potential that mitigates acidic corrosion while matching the MnO2 two&#8208;electron redox. Systematic investigation of anion effects reveals that concentrated Cl&#8722; anions restructure the In3+ solvation, forming stable chloro&#8208;complexes that lower dissociation energy and promote uniform Indium (In) deposition. Conversely, SO42&#8722;&#8208;rich electrolytes impede In plating but enhance MnO2 crystallization and MnO2/Mn2+ reversibility. Through tailored Cl&#8722;/SO42&#8722; ratios and an anion&#8208;decoupled dual&#8208;electrolyte configuration, the battery operates at &#8764;1.7&#160;V with 72.3% energy efficiency (EE) and over 1500 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.&#160;Furthermore, we demonstrate an electrode&#8208;less IMB using a Bi substrate at the anode, where in situ alloying&#8208;driven In deposition enables over 2000 stable cycles at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (2 mAh cm&#8722;2), delivering a compelling energy density of 484.5&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a high cumulative areal capacity of 4120 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a design paradigm coupling anion&#8208;regulated interfacial chemistry with substrate engineering for high&#8208;performance acidic IMB.

         <title>Spillover&#8208;Mediated H* Redistribution Promotes Electrocatalytic Acetonitrile Hydrogenation in PEM Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium with high H* coverage is partnered with copper with low H* coverage to enable palladium&#8208;to&#8208;copper hydrogen spillover, which reduces H* coverage on Pd to mitigate H2 evolution and increases H* availability on Cu to promote ethylamine productivity. Utilization of these catalysts into a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled an expected improvement in ethylamine production rate, HER suppression, and energy efficiency. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetonitrile hydrogenation (EAH) provides a sustainable route for ethylamine synthesis, yet suffers from low productivity, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and high energy consumption due to suboptimal catalyst and reactor design. To overcome these challenges, we describe a palladium&#8208;copper hybrid catalyst that employs spillover&#8208;mediated active hydrogen (H*) redistribution mechanism. Hydrogen spillover from palladium with high H* coverage to copper with low H* coverage creates H* redistribution: reduced H* coverage of Pd mitigates HER while maintaining efficient EAH, and increased H* availability of Cu promotes EAH without activating stagnant HER. Integration of these catalysts into both cathode and anode of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled efficient ethylamine electrosynthesis and formic acid electrooxidation over 100&#160;h, achieving exceptional ethylamine productivity (6160.0&#160;&#177;&#160;119.1&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (94.2&#160;&#177;&#160;1.6%) at record&#8208;low energy consumption (3.55&#160;kWh&#160;kgethylamine&#8722;1). This work marks a critical advancement toward sustainable ethylamine electrosynthesis.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonding in the Formation and Dynamics of Two Distinct Types of Cyclic Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic supramolecular polymer (SP), resembling a cyclic covalent polymer in terms of both its appearance and the cyclization mechanism, was found and characterized using high&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy. Here, dynamic hydrogen bonding played an important role in endowing the polymeric chain with flexibility.








Abstract
Cyclic polymers are attractive synthetic targets in both polymer chemistry and supramolecular polymer (SP) chemistry; however, there is a gap between these two research fields in terms of the synthetic strategies involved, and achieving a commonality remains elusive. Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette&#8208;shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. An all&#8208;atom molecular&#8208;dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various &#8220;conformations&#8221; due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real&#8208;time high&#8208;speed atomic&#8208;force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.

         <title>Reductive Deamination of a Diaminogermylene Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion: Isolation of Ge(I), Ge(0) and Ge(&#8208;I) Products</title>

         <dc:description>
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] reacts with Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2 by a sequential reductive deamination pathway. The initially formed aluminacyclodigermene contains Ge(I) centres and may be considered as a &#951;2&#8208;coordinated digermyne at aluminium. Further reduction leads to compounds containing a &#956;,&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;[Ge(0)]2 unit coordinated to two Al(NON) groups, or a Ge4&#8208;cluster containing species with oxidation state Ge(&#8208;I). DFT analysis indicates reduced Al centres and Ge&#9472;Ge multiple bonding in both the [RGeGeR] and [Ge2] groups.








Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;&#160;=&#160;[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the diaminogermylene Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2 afforded [K(C6H6)][Al(NON){(Me3Si)2NGeGeN(SiMe3)2}] containing an AlGe2 ring. Structural and computational analysis confirm an aluminacyclodigermene complex that can be considered as an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated digermyne at aluminium with Ge(I) centres. This compound is an intermediate on the reduction pathway to K3[(Ge4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], which contains a distorted tetrahedral cluster of Ge(&#8208;I) centres. Characterisation of the dialumane (NON)Al&#9472;Al(NON) from this reaction is indicative of sequential one electron redox processes initiated by the aluminyl anion. Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane afforded K2[{Al(NON)}2(Ge2)], containing a formally digermanium(0) unit with an exceptionally long Ge&#9552;Ge double bond.

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;[O(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with the diaminogermylene Ge[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded [K(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)][Al(NON){(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NGeGeN(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}] containing an AlGe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring. Structural and computational analysis confirm an aluminacyclodigermene complex that can be considered as an &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated digermyne at aluminium with Ge(I) centres. This compound is an intermediate on the reduction pathway to K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[(Ge&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;){Al(NON)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}], which contains a distorted tetrahedral cluster of Ge(-I) centres. Characterisation of the dialumane (NON)Al&#9472;Al(NON) from this reaction is indicative of sequential one electron redox processes initiated by the aluminyl anion. Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane afforded K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[{Al(NON)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)], containing a formally digermanium(0) unit with an exceptionally long Ge&#9552;Ge double bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Lithiation&#8208;Borylation for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopentyl and Cyclobutyl Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentyl and cyclobutyl 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters have been prepared from benzylic carbamates with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The method enables the asymmetric cycloalkanes bearing bis&#8208;boronic esters which can be manipulated independently. 








Abstract
Saturated carbocycles are common motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and so methods for their construction, particularly with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol, are of high importance. Lithiation&#8208;borylation has emerged as powerful methodology for the stereocontrolled construction of acyclic carbon chains but has not previously been used for the stereocontrolled synthesis of carbocycles. Herein, we report that benzylic diethylcarbamates with a tethered vicinal bis&#8208;boronic ester moiety can be deprotonated with lithium amide bases, resulting in cyclization and 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement to give carbocycles. This intramolecular lithiation&#8208;borylation reaction is completely regioselective and, rather than being stereospecific like the acyclic variants, it is diastereoconvergent. Stereochemistry of the boronic ester is retained but the benzylic stereocenter undergoes epimerization, furnishing carbocycles with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol from easily accessible precursors. Site&#8208;selective transformations of the bis&#8208;boronic ester products are also demonstrated.

         <title>Carbene Insertion and Furyl Migration Cascade Toward Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed selective carbene insertion into unsaturated imines yielded &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center. These aldehydes underwent formal 1,3&#8208;furan migration to ultimately be transformed into highly substituted benzofurans.








Abstract
Divergent access to complex molecular skeletons from the same set of readily available raw materials has been a primary goal of chemical synthesis, owing to their widespread application in drug research. In this study, a copper&#8208;catalyzed insertion reaction of a disubstituted carbene into an unsaturated imine has been developed to form &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center, which subsequently undergo an unprecedented forward 1,2&#8208;/backward 1,4&#8208;furyl migration cascade, ultimately affording a highly substituted benzofuran. A formal 1,3&#8208;furan migration is involved in this multistep cascade sequence, broadening the substrate scope under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Long Range Coherent Energy Transfer in Artificial Multichromophoric Antenna Systems&#8212;A Case of Breaking Kasha's Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a unitary quantum&#8208;yield long&#8208;range energy transfer in a novel family of artificial DNA&#8208;guided multichromophoric antenna complexes. We demonstrated that it occurs via a coherent mechanism enabled by the photoexcitation of delocalized higher excited states of the complex, being in this respect an anti&#8208;Kasha process. The importance of exciplex formation between acceptor and closest donor was also studied.








Abstract
Ultrafast long&#8208;range energy transfer with unitary quantum&#8208;yield has been studied in a novel family of artificial DNA&#8208;guided multichromophoric antenna complexes with phenanthrene moieties as light harvesters. By means of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density function theory calculations, we demonstrate that the highly efficient long&#8208;range energy transfer occurs via a coherent mechanism. It is enabled by photoexcitation of higher lying delocalized excited states of phenanthrene, and hence, can be labelled anti&#8208;Kasha in nature. Moreover, we show the important contribution of exciplex formation between acceptor and closest donor.

         <title>Crown Ether&#8211;Peptide Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of crown ether&#8208;peptide rotaxanes is reported, incorporating a broad range of canonical and unnatural peptides into a threaded peptide backbone without the need for additional nonamide template sites in the axle. The 24C8 macrocycle is locked on the glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane, allowing the formation of different kinetically stable positional isomers.








Abstract
We report on the metal&#8208;free active template synthesis of crown ether&#8211;peptide rotaxanes. A 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether&#8211;tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide&#8211;axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.

         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclized boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been constructed by engineering the intermolecular packing, which has led to near&#8208;unity photoluminescence yields and excellent reverse intersystem crossing being achieved via intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in the solid state.

The development of high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost multi resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters especially in the deep&#8208;blue region is critically limited due to intrinsic excimer quenching of planar &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks. Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high&#8208;efficiency oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclized boron&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D&#8211;A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited&#8208;state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin&#8208;flip, and thus achieving near&#8208;unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs with deep&#8208;blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR&#8208;TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited&#8208;state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.

&lt;p&gt;Oxygen-bridged cyclized boron-based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been constructed by engineering the intermolecular packing, which has led to near-unity photoluminescence yields and excellent reverse intersystem crossing being achieved via intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in the solid state.

         <title>Strictly Periodic, Adenine&#8208;Directed One&#8208;Pot Assembly of Multicomponent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structural Insights and Ethylene Purification</title>

         <dc:description>
An exception quinary metal&#8208;organic framework, Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC, constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters, has been successfully synthesized. Owing to its inherent pore cavities and tailored microenvironment, Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC demonstrates efficient single&#8208;step purification of ethylene from complex ternary C2 mixtures and binary MTO products.








Abstract
The pursuit of advanced adsorbents with exceptional gas adsorption and separation capability represents a highly promising yet challenging research frontier. Several quinary multicomponent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been documented in the literature, however, the construction of quinary MOFs through the synergistic integration of two distinct organic ligands and three different metal clusters remains scarce. Herein, solvothermal reaction of Zn(OAc)2&#183;2H2O with adenine and 1,2,4&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic anhydride afforded a novel MOF of Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC. SCXRD reveals that Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC incorporates three distinct zinc&#8208;based structural units of a mononuclear [ZnN2(O2C&#9472;)2], a dinuclear [Zn2(Ad)3(O2C&#9472;)2], and a hexanuclear [Zn6N3(&#956;&#8208;H2O)3(Ad)3(O2C&#9472;)6], respectively. These units assemble into a novel quinary MOF structure, distinguished as the unusual material constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters. It features three interconnected cage&#8208;like cavities replete with uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and Watson&#9472;Crick sites. Gas adsorption investigations indicate that Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC demonstrates notable selectivity toward acetylene, ethane, and propylene adsorption, enabling the single&#8208;step ethylene purification from trinary C2 mixtures and binary MTO products. Computational simulations reveal that preferential adsorptions are facilitated by different supramolecular interaction strengths. Given its cost&#8208;effective and readily accessible synthesis precursors, along with excellent thermal and chemical stability, Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC holds great promise for advanced gas adsorption and separation applications.

         <title>Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Anthracene Core for Recognition of Benzene Over Cyclohexane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest&#8208;responsive gate&#8208;opening behavior has been observed for an activated flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with an anthracene&#8208;core, which enables efficient separation of benzene/cyclohexane mixtures. Furthermore, the intrinsic &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the anthracene&#8208;core and its strong interaction with benzene, leads to significant changes in color and fluorescence emission upon guest inclusion.








Abstract
Flexibility is considered one of the most critical features of framework materials, playing a vital role in applications such as adsorption and separation. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibit unique flexibility derived from their weak, reversible hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions; however, realizing controlled and functional flexible behavior in HOFs remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;119, constructed from an anthracene&#8208;core, that exhibits multimode guest&#8208;responsive behavior. Upon activation, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;119a undergoes distinct gate&#8208;opening transformations in response to CO2 at 196&#160;K and benzene vapor at room temperature. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and vapor adsorption isotherms reveal the emergence of new adsorption sites in the benzene&#8208;loaded phase, driven by strong interactions and the flexibility of C&#8801;N&#8943;H&#9472;C hydrogen bonds, enabling selective benzene/cyclohexane separation. Notably, the adsorption of benzene induces a visible color change in fluorescence emission and a red shift of approximately 60&#160;nm. Structural and density functional theory (DFT) analyses confirm increased molecular planarity, extended conjugation, and a narrowed bandgap. This work demonstrates a rare integration of selective adsorption, molecular recognition, and signal transduction within a single crystalline framework, offering a versatile platform for the development of intelligent porous materials with real&#8208;time visual tracking capabilities.

         <title>A Natural Oxygen&#8208;Harvesting Electrode Enables Aeration&#8208;Free Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation for In Situ Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

An aeration&#8208;free electro&#8208;AOP system is developed using a dual&#8208;cathode design featuring a natural oxygen&#8208;harvesting electrode (NOHE) with a superhydrophobic, microporous structure. By capturing anodically generated O2 for in situ H2O2 production, the system enables 98% mineralization of bisphenol AF in seawater, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient solution for decentralized water remediation.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;Fenton treatment through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers an effective approach for degrading persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in water; however, aeration is always required to overcome the low solubility of oxygen in water, ensuring adequate oxygen availability for the 2e&#8722; ORR to generate H2O2 and facilitate its transport for activation into hydroxyl radicals. The aeration energy consumption can reach tens of times higher than the energy required for the electrochemical reactions themselves. To address this, we developed an aeration&#8208;free dual&#8208;cathode system featuring a natural oxygen&#8208;harvesting electrode (NOHE). The NOHE's superhydrophobic and microporous structure effectively captures and utilizes anode&#8208;generated oxygen for H2O2 synthesis (957.1&#160;mg&#160;gcat&#8722;1) without external aeration. By decoupling H2O2 generation and activation into separate cathodes, the system optimizes both processes independently, achieving superior efficiency. This design demonstrated rapid removal of bisphenol AF (BPAF) in saline environments, achieving 98% mineralization and exhibiting excellent operational stability over 90&#160;h continuous use. By eliminating energy&#8208;intensive aeration, our approach may open the avenue for a scalable, sustainable solution for in situ water remediation, with broad applicability in diverse aquatic environments.

The conjugated molecular reactors (CuPPc), featuring interlayer diatomic Cu&#8208;N4 sites with tunable spacings (4.0&#8211;5.7&#160;&#197;), is designed for electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate. CuPPc&#8208;4.0 with optimal 4.0&#160;&#197; spacing, spatially matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5&#160;&#197;), achieves a record urea yield rate, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, ensuring electrocatalytic durability.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling offers a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes for urea synthesis. Herein, we design conjugated polymer&#8208;based molecular reactors featuring interlayer diatomic Cu&#8211;N4 sites and precisely tunable spacings (4.0, 4.6, and 5.7&#160;&#197;) to optimize CO2 and nitrate coupling. The 4.0&#160;&#197;&#8208;spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc&#8208;4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.3&#160;V (versus RHE), outperforming wider&#8208;spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0&#160;&#197; cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5&#160;&#197;), thereby enhancing C&#8211;N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball&#8208;milling treatment increases single&#8208;atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%. This work demonstrates a multidimensional catalyst design integrating atomic precision and molecular confinement for sustainable electrosynthesis.

         <title>Controlling the Mechanical Response of Polymers via Metal Induced Coordination Conformational Changes</title>

Polymers containing edta groups can bind metal ions in an intrachain manner that results in &#8220;microrigidification&#8221; of the polymer backbone and subsequent changes in mechanical characteristics.








Abstract
The modulation of mechanical properties in polymers with metal binding ligands has largely been achieved via crosslinking between polymer chains induced by metal ion binding to pendant or end ligating groups. In this work, incorporation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H4edta) into the main chain backbone of flexible, linear polymers results in substantial modulation of mechanical properties via conformational changes in the imbedded ligand within the polymer backbone induced by metal ion binding. Upon the addition of metal ions, these polymers transform from viscous liquids into solids with improved elastic characteristics. Polymer strength and toughness are significantly enhanced without the need for extensive polymer crosslinking. This approach represents a new paradigm in using metal ions to modulate the mechanical properties of organic polymers.

         <title>Tailoring Lattice Oxygen Redox and Robust Structure Stability in High&#8208;Entropy Superlattice Layered Cathode for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

An entropy&#8208;modulated layered oxide material (K0.7Mn0.4Li0.1Co0.125Ni0.125Fe0.125Cu0.125O2) is designed to leverage the inversed anion&#8211;cation redox process with a stable single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;state mechanism originating from macroscopic ion disorder and local lattice distortion features to achieve breakthroughs in potassium cathode functionality in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density.








Abstract
To address the inherent limitations of layered cathodes in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density, a high&#8208;entropy superlattice layered oxide (K0.7Mn0.4Li0.1Co0.125Ni0.125Fe0.125Cu0.125O2, KMNCFCL0.1) is proposed as a cathode for K&#8208;ion storage. High&#8208;entropy composition and [Li&#9472;O&#9472;K] configuration coupled with Cu&#9472;O covalency and local CuO6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic&#8211;cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid&#8208;solution mechanism benefited from high&#8208;entropy stabilization, and &#8220;cocktail&#8221; effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) lattice distortion, O&#9472;O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K+/vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K&#8208;ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL0.1 delivers a high energy density of 327.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability. This research opens up new possibilities for achieving groundbreaking cathodic functionality in potassium layered oxides.

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow Materials Exhibiting 11.2&#160;nm FWHM, 38% Phosphorescence Efficiency and 1.5&#160;s Emission Lifetime Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A jade pendant&#8208;like molecular design enables narrowband organic afterglow with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 11.2&#160;nm. By enhancing low&#8208;frequency vibronic coupling in a coronene&#8208;based localized&#8208;excitation system, the material exhibits long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and even organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Narrowband organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains rare due to significant high&#8208;frequency vibronic coupling in T1&#8594;S0 electronic transition, where T1 and S0 represent the lowest triplet excited state and ground state, respectively. Here, we report coronene&#8208;derived (CoDe) luminophores exhibiting ultra&#8208;narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM&#160;=&#160;11.2&#160;nm) with a&#160;1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low&#8208;frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high&#8208;power excitation, the CoDe&#8208;PhB further exhibits organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40&#160;min (FWHM&#160;=&#160;14.7&#160;nm), governed by a two&#8208;photon ionization&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt&#8208;casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high&#8208;color&#8208;purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low&#8208;frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;based designs.

By incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl)&#8212;a bifunctional molecule containing both P&#9472;Cl and P&#9552;O functional groups&#8212;we have designed and in situ synthesized A&#8242;&#8208;site cations with oxygen&#8211;phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (O&#9472;P&#9472;N&#9472;C) frameworks, namely DPCl&#8208;PEA+ and DPCl&#8208;FA+. These cations can modulate the crystallization kinetics to reduce the formation of low&#8208;n phases and passivate defects via their P&#9552;O functional groups. This integration results in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) achieving a champion efficiency of 26.07%.








Abstract
Despite quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs) having shown great potential in the fields of light emission and display, the uncontrollable crystallization processes and substantial defects of perovskite emissive layer still limit their further development. Herein, we reported the design and in&#8208;situ synthesis of A&#8242;&#8208;site cations with oxygen&#8211;phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (O&#9472;P&#9472;N&#9472;C) frameworks in perovskite precursor solutions by incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl), a bifunctional molecule containing both P&#9472;Cl and P&#9552;O functional groups. The P&#9472;Cl groups undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with the ammonium terminals of formamidinium (FA+) and phenethylammonium (PEA+) cations, yielding large A&#8242;&#8208;site cations that regulate crystallization kinetics during spin&#8208;coating. Concurrently, P&#9552;O groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ ions at grain boundaries, passivating defects. This dual&#8208;functional mechanism synergistically optimized crystallization dynamic and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in compact, low&#8208;defect perovskite films. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, the quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs modified with DPCl exhibited a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.07%. This study provides a new strategy for tailoring perovskite materials through A&#8242;&#8208;site engineering, offering significant insights into the development of high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

The bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide diradicaloid compound [(ADC)2Ge4] featuring a stretched bridgehead Ge&#9472;Ge bond is reported as a Venetian red crystalline solid. [(ADC)2Ge4] has been characterized by experimental and computational methods and its reactivity with TEMPO and Fe2(CO)9 has been explored.








Abstract
The synthesis, structure, and reactivity of the bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Ge2]2 (3), which features a Ge4 core bridged by two anionic dicarbene frameworks (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), are reported. Treatment of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized amidine Me3SiC&#8801;CN(Dipp)C(Ph)&#9552;N(Dipp) (1) with GeCl4 affords [(ADC)GeCl3(GeCl4)] (2). KC8 reduction of 2 yields 3 as a Venetian red crystalline solid. DFT calculations reveal a singlet ground state for 3 with the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 14&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. CASSCF (complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) calculations suggest a modest diradical character (&#946;&#160;=&#160;9%) for 3. Compound 3 readily reacts with TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) to yield the Ge&#9472;Ge bond&#8208;cleaved product, [(ADC)Ge(Ge&#8208;TEMPO)]2 (4). Treatment of 3 with Fe2(CO)9 gives [(ADC)Ge(Ge{Fe(CO)4})]2 (5).

         <title>Fluorescent Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with pcu Topology Based on Triangular Antiprism Node</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent triangular antiprism building block was designed and synthesized, whose imine condensation with linear linkers afforded two crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with 6&#8208;fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology. Notably, both COFs exhibit yellow&#8208;green solid&#8208;state fluorescence and display high&#8208;contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions.








Abstract
The design of highly connected fluorescent polyhedral building blocks is essential for expanding the structural and functional diversity of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) but remains largely underexplored due to synthetic and characterization challenges. Here, we report a hexatopic fluorescent building block with triangular antiprismatic geometry, developed via steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;directed conformational control and the integration of triphenylamine units. Its imine condensation with linear diamines afforded two crystalline 3D COFs with unambiguously resolved 6&#8208;fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology, as determined by continuous rotation electron diffraction. Interestingly, both COFs exhibit yellow&#8208;green solid&#8208;state fluorescence and high&#8208;contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions. This work introduces a new class of fluorescent polyhedral nodes to expand the structural diversity of fluorescent 3D COFs and highlights their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials for interesting applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition of Diynes via Vinyl Cations</title>

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations has been disclosed, enabling the efficient and practical synthesis of valuable chiral polycyclic indoles with excellent yields and unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. This reaction features the first asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations and the first enantioselective triyne cyclization for the construction of carbon stereocenters. 








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes represents an efficient and atom&#8208;economical strategy for the assembly of valuable chiral cyclic targets in a single step. However, this strategy traditionally relies on the cyclometallation process. Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C&#9472;C double/triple bonds and C&#9472;X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C&#9472;C double/triple bonds and C&#9472;X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3&#8208;b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.

This universal [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C&#9472;C double/triple bonds and C&#9472;X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3-b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar&#8208;Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduce &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation as a universal paradigm to equilibrate bandgap, birefringence, and SHG&#8208;responsible constraints. Enable an NLO crystal (GUPO) that exhibits full&#8208;wavelength PM ability (down to 215&#160;nm) and outperforms the traditional commercial KDP's PM wavelength limit by 43&#160;nm blueshift.








Abstract
While birefringence phase&#8208;matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;n&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&#955; &lt; 280&#160;nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite&#8208;based NLO crystals: (C2N4OH7)H2PO3 (GUPO) and C(NH2)3H2PO3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guanidinium cations and [H2PO3]&#8315; anions enables record&#8208;breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.19 @ 589.3&#160;nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full&#8208;wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215&#160;nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm and 1.0 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO at 532&#160;nm), which may enable direct 266&#160;nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Ni&#8208;MOF Reconstruction into Active Ni(OH)2 OER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top&#8208;down reconstruction of a Ni&#8208;based MOF yields ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional, defect&#8208;rich Ni hydroxides. In situ studies unveil pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;driven phase transitions to active NiOOH species. In situ XAS reveals dynamic Ni&#9472;O bond evolution and reversible Ni2+/Ni3+ redox states. DFT supports an adsorbed oxygen evolution mechanism via exposed Ni2+ centers.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), composed of one&#8208;dimensional Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains interconnected by 1,4&#8208;ndc linker, into catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. This top&#8208;down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4&#8208;ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional (thickness &#8764; 1.5&#8211;2.6&#160;nm), defect&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA.cm&#8722;2, surpassing commercial IrO2. In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni&#9472;O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89&#160;&#197; under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Reusable Substrate for Capture and Red Light&#8208;Responsive Release of Circulating Rare Cells with High Cytoactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reusable substrate that leverages Ru complexes and photo&#8208;responsive ligand substitution is developed to capture cells with replaceable antibodies. Under red&#8208;light irradiation, the substrate achieves considerable capture and release efficiencies for different circulating rare cells with cytoactivity, offering a new platform for the development of responsive biomedical interfaces with high biosafety.








Abstract
Efficient and reusable biomedical interfaces are necessary for the isolation and nondestructive release of circulating rare cells in blood. However, photo&#8208;responsive release strategy, particularly that using red light, relies on photothermal effect, which could potentially affect cell activity through local overheating. To overcome this issue, we develop reusable functional substrates (RuSub&#8208;S&#8208;SA&#8208;Ab) based on ruthenium (Ru) complexes with photo&#8208;responsive ligand substitution to capture cells by using replaceable antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity. Our RuSub&#8208;S&#8208;SA&#8208;Ab achieved capture efficiencies&#160;&gt;85% for four different cell lines and release efficiencies of 90% under safe doses of red light (660&#160;nm, 100 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2,&#160;60&#160;s), thus offering a new platform for the development of responsive biomedical interfaces with high biosafety.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Assay System to Quantify O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) Activity in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded, imaging&#8208;based reporter enables direct measurement of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) activity in living cells. The system exploits OGT&#8208;dependent proteolysis of HCF&#8208;1 to drive nuclear and cytoplasmic redistribution of fluorescent signals, allowing cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell spatially resolved quantification of OGT activity. This OGT&#8208;CAR platform offers a powerful tool for studying OGT regulation and discovering cellular modulators.








Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes O&#8208;GlcNAcylation of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins and plays important roles in regulating diverse cellular functions. Dysregulation of OGT is implicated in various diseases, including cancers and neurodegeneration. Despite its vital roles, little is known about how this enzyme is regulated within cells in part because no current assays directly report on its activity within cells. Here we describe a genetically encoded reporter of cellular OGT glycosyltransferase activity by exploiting the transferase&#8208;dependent proteolytic activity of OGT on host cell factor&#8208;1 (HCF&#8208;1). The reporter comprises sites at which OGT cleaves HCF&#8208;1, which are flanked by two different fluorescent proteins that are linked to either nuclear export or import sequences. OGT&#8208;catalyzed cleavage of this construct leads to separation and independent localization of these two fluorescent proteins. By quantifying their nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions, OGT activity can be measured. We validated this OGT cellular activity reporter (CAR) system using known modulators of the O&#8208;GlcNAc pathway and assessed the effects of several metabolites on OGT activity. Analyses of the dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent effects of these OGT modulators illustrate the sensitivity and precision of this OGT&#8208;CAR strategy. We envision this OGT&#8208;CAR system will aid in discovering and characterizing modifiers of OGT activity.

&lt;p&gt;A genetically encoded, imaging-based reporter enables direct measurement of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) activity in living cells. The system exploits OGT-dependent proteolysis of HCF-1 to drive nuclear and cytoplasmic redistribution of fluorescent signals, allowing cell-by-cell spatially resolved quantification of OGT activity. This OGT-CAR platform offers a powerful tool for studying OGT regulation and discovering cellular modulators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-GlcNAcylation of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins and plays important roles in regulating diverse cellular functions. Dysregulation of OGT is implicated in various diseases, including cancers and neurodegeneration. Despite its vital roles, little is known about how this enzyme is regulated within cells in part because no current assays directly report on its activity within cells. Here we describe a genetically encoded reporter of cellular OGT glycosyltransferase activity by exploiting the transferase-dependent proteolytic activity of OGT on host cell factor-1 (HCF-1). The reporter comprises sites at which OGT cleaves HCF-1, which are flanked by two different fluorescent proteins that are linked to either nuclear export or import sequences. OGT-catalyzed cleavage of this construct leads to separation and independent localization of these two fluorescent proteins. By quantifying their nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions, OGT activity can be measured. We validated this OGT cellular activity reporter (CAR) system using known modulators of the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-GlcNAc pathway and assessed the effects of several metabolites on OGT activity. Analyses of the dose- and time-dependent effects of these OGT modulators illustrate the sensitivity and precision of this OGT-CAR strategy. We envision this OGT-CAR system will aid in discovering and characterizing modifiers of OGT activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters with Intrinsic Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich excited&#8208;state dynamics of intrinsically chiral silver nanoclusters tethering cationic species on the surface demonstrates the excited&#8208;state dependent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), suggesting the temporal evolution of exciton distribution.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is a powerful tool to probe the chiroptical properties of molecular systems in the excited state. Here, we demonstrate the evolution of excited&#8208;state chiroptical property in silver nanoclusters (NCs) by CPL measurements. The use of bidentate thiolate ligand, 1,3&#8208;benzenedithiol (BDT), with the aid of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), affords racemic [Ag29(BDT)12(PPh3)4]3&#8722; NCs (Ag29 NCs) with intrinsic chirality in the exterior cage composed of a silver(I)&#8208;dithiolate coordination framework, that are separable by chiral column chromatography. We have recently reported that the post&#8208;synthetic modification of negatively charged Ag29 NCs with a cationic silver(I) complex on the exterior cage stabilizes a specific excited state with a triplet character, enhancing photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. While the same modification on the separated enantiomeric NCs does not change the circular dichroism (CD) profile so much, the CPL activity is dramatically enhanced with an increase in the anisotropy factor (|glum| value) from &lt;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 to 6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, demonstrating the excited&#8208;state dependent CPL property of Ag29 NCs. In combination with the picosecond PL decay study, the low&#8208;temperature CPL measurement indicates the time development of excited&#8208;state property, suggesting the possible evolution of CPL activity.

         <title>Efficient C&#8722;N Coupling via Oxidation State Inversion in Asymmetric Copper&#8211;Zinc Amorphous&#8208;Like Atomic Clusters Driving Photoelectrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;inversed Cu&#8211;Zn amorphous&#8208;like ultra&#8208;small atomic clusters photocathode enables enhanced photoelectrochemical urea synthesis. The oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;inverted Cu&#948;&#8314;&#8211;Zn&#948;&#8314; dual sites steer nitrate activation toward non&#8208;canonical *NO intermediates, establishing distinct pathways that diverge from conventional routes to drive effective C&#8211;N coupling.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) coupling of CO2 and nitrate presents a sustainable strategy for urea synthesis under ambient conditions. However, the complexity of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process restricts the selective formation of the key intermediates, impeding efficient C&#8211;N coupling. Here, copper&#8211;zinc amorphous&#8208;like ultra&#8208;small atomic clusters are developed for efficient urea synthesis. The atomically disordered arrangement in the amorphous&#8208;like structure breaks the periodicity constraints of crystalline counterpart, enabling asymmetric Cu&#948;+&#8211;Zn&#948;+ coordination featuring oxidation state inversion, where the Cu oxidation state elevates within a narrow valence range (0 &lt; &#948; &lt; 1) and the Zn oxidation state reduces compared to the crystalline counterpart. More importantly, the oxidation state inversion generates electron&#8208;deficient Cu centers that stabilize the formation of new *NO intermediates, which are identified as a key intermediate that facilitates coupling with *CO species adsorbed on the electron&#8208;rich Zn sites, effectively reducing the activation barrier for C&#8211;N coupling involved in the formation of *OCNO. Under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation, the PEC system demonstrated well&#8208;balanced performance, achieving a high production rate of 64.03 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low external potential of &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, with a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 46.60% and an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of 17.6% at monochromatic illumination.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic Daphniphyllum alkaloids was the Calyciphylline D&#8208;type alkaloid, featuring a strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system.

Abstract
Calyciphylline F represents the final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic&#8208;type of Daphniphyllum alkaloids due to the strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system. Here, we report the total synthesis of calyciphylline F. We construct the ring system by applying [4&#160;+&#160;3] cycloaddition reaction of pyrroles with 2&#8208;oxyallyl cations to an intramolecular reaction, followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction and capture of the resulting alkoxide as the xanthate. The bridgehead quaternary carbon center is constructed by the intramolecular addition reaction of the bridgehead radical to the alkoxy&#8208;acrylate, which is designed based on the proposed mechanism of by&#8208;product formation. Finally, another 6&#8208;exo&#8208;radical cyclization reaction constructs the last remaining ring and achieves the total synthesis of calyciphylline F.

         <title>3D Gas Diffusion Layer with Dual&#8208;Metal Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE, achieving a remarkable FEC2+ of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE with a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The chitosan&#8208;induced 3D structure enhances CO2 accessibility, while DFT simulation reveal the tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#8208;Ag dual sites&#8212;Cu activates CO2 into CO* and Ag promotes CHO* formation, enabling asymmetric coupling for C2+ products.








Abstract
Achieving satisfactory C2+ products selectivity and current density in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) remains a challenge for the practical applications. Here, we design a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products, which shows a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE and a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the chitosan with multiple functional groups induces the formation of 3D architecture, which enhances the accessibility of reactive sites and mitigates the limitations associated with CO2 diffusion. The abundant hydrogen bonds between chitosan and CO2 promote the adsorption and enrichment of reactant. Furthermore, the Cu site exhibits stronger activation capacity for CO2 and facilitates the subsequent electron transfer process for the formation of intermediate *CO. The DFT simulation also reveals the thermodynamic favorable for *CO migrating from Cu site to Ag site. Moreover, the Ag site exhibits a more negative Gibbs free energy for the protonation of *CO to *CHO, which facilitates the asymmetric coupling of *CO (Cu site) and *CHO (Ag site), ultimately enhancing the generation of C2+ products. Consequently, the unique 3D structure and tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#9472;Ag dual sites achieves high activity for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products.

The abundant hydrogen bonds between chitosan and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; promote the adsorption and enrichment of reactant. Furthermore, the Cu site exhibits stronger activation capacity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and facilitates the subsequent electron transfer process for the formation of intermediate *CO. The DFT simulation also reveals the thermodynamic favorable for *CO migrating from Cu site to Ag site. Moreover, the Ag site exhibits a more negative Gibbs free energy for the protonation of *CO to *CHO, which facilitates the asymmetric coupling of *CO (Cu site) and *CHO (Ag site), ultimately enhancing the generation of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products. Consequently, the unique 3D structure and tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#9472;Ag dual sites achieves high activity for eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;photon Absorption Switch via Cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;Salt&#8208;to&#8208;Cocrystal Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation, we construct for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch between upconversion and Stokes emission. This single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) interconvert for 20 cycles, demonstrating an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials, which holds promising applications in display devices and rewritable information storage.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive organic cocrystals are typically governed by single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation, remaining a long&#8208;standing challenge due to disruption of long&#8208;range order structure throughout the whole solid&#8208;state process. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch based on reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal SCSC transformation. While both para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene and meta&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene coassemble with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) into cocrystals via donor&#8211;acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonds, only the former cocrystal exhibits broad&#8208;window TPA activity alongside enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Theoretical calculations confirm that positional isomerism of electron donors modulates molecular coplanarity and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in cocrystals, directly controlling TPA cross&#8208;sections. Remarkably, para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene undergoes diprotonation by exposure to trifluoroacetic acid, enabling the conversion of the cocrystal to a salt form, which can be reverted upon triethylamine treatment. This cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation switches the TPA characteristics with reversible color changes between upconversion orange emission and Stokes yellow luminescence for 20 cycles, to the best of our knowledge, which is an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials. Based on the unique acid&#8208;responsive emission, we also apply the SCSC transformation in display devices and information storage. This study elucidates structure&#8208;property relationships governing TPA in cocrystals and establishes a new paradigm for stimuli&#8208;responsive optical switches.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Chemically Recyclable Polyamides via Substituent Effects&#8208;Enabled Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The joint presence of ketone and diester functionalities in dimethyl acetone&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylate enhances its reactivity toward amines compared to the individual reactivity of each group, due to substituent effects. This increased reactivity enables the efficient synthesis of polyamides under mild conditions, and the resulting polymers are chemically recyclable.








Abstract
Imination and amidation are two fundamental condensation reactions central to modern chemical synthesis, and devising energy&#8208;efficient ways to trigger them is highly relevant in advancing low&#8208;carbon manufacturing, with most approaches relying on the use of catalysts. Here, we revisit the dimethyl acetone&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylate (DADC) chemistry, and show that it can react with a broad range of small&#8208;molecule and macromolecular amines at moderate temperatures (80&#8210;120&#160;&#176;C) in the absence of any catalysts. This represents a significant reduction in processing temperatures compared to traditional polycondensation methods for polyamide synthesis, which often require temperatures exceeding 230&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic and model studies reveal that the high reactivity of DADC toward amines arises from its synergistic substituent effects; Specifically, the two ester groups in the symmetric &#946;&#8208;position of DADC&#8217;s ketone facilitate initial imination via conjugation and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, generating a &#946;&#8208;enamino intermediate. This &#946;&#8208;enamine subsequently engages in intramolecular hydrogen bonding with one ester group, reducing steric hindrance on the remaining ester and thus promoting its amidation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the DADC&#8208;synthesized polyamides are thermally reprocessable, and chemically recyclable under either acidic or basic conditions at mild temperatures, and the chemical recycling is possible both for the neat polymer and its mixture with other plastics.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries through Halogen Bonding Inversion and Non&#8208;Identical&#8208;Frequency Molecular Vibrations</title>

         <dc:description>
The charge preanisotropy of ClAN forms &#963;&#8208;holes specific adsorption, which assures electron&#8208;scale manageable coordination to high valence iodine species (I+). The non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency vibrations response of ClAN with water molecules leads to rapid migration in protic solvents. The combination of the two drives the targeted coordination of the electrolyte additives to I+, breaking the reliance on the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte in conventional multi&#8208;electron transfer zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The activation of four&#8208;electron transfer behavior through I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion reactions is crucial for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) but is hindered by the rapid hydrolysis of I+ in protic solvents. Theoretically, the directionality and modifiability of halogen bonds (XBs) can be used to regulate the hydrolytic disproportionation of I+. Given that the conventional coordination configuration is not applicable because of the locking of the XB donor (I+), the inversion of the coordination configuration to establish a charge distribution preanisotropy (&#963;&#8208;holes) and thus realize XB&#8208;stabilizing electron&#8208;scale coordination is vital for breaking down the barriers existing in protic solvents. To counteract external environmental disturbances, the cohesive energy differentiation based on the Hansen parameter creates the non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations of additives with water. Herein, an electrolyte additive (chloroacetonitrile, ClAN) with these advantages enabled the redox coupling of I&#8722;/I0/I+ at a very low salt concentration (4 molar kg&#8722;1). The corresponding ZIB exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 175.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and showed an extremely high specific capacity at high rates (133.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a generalized framework and new horizons for halogen batteries with multiple electron transfers.

         <title>KF&#183;[SO2(NH2)2]: the First Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Sulfonamide Fluoride Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Novel Cairo Pentagonal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the halide salt ionic framework construction strategy, the first sulfonamide fluoride, KF&#183;[SO2(NH2)2], was successfully synthesized, featuring a novel Cairo pentagonal structure with electroneutral SO2(NH2)2 groups stabled. It achieves a balance of a large SHG response of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP@1064&#160;nm, a large birefringence of 0.079@546&#160;nm, and a DUV cutoff edge of&#160;&lt;&#160;190&#160;nm.








Abstract
The sulfonamide group (SO2(NH2)2) shows great potential for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals due to its strong hyperpolarizability and anisotropy, but its neutrality and poor protonation limit its application. Here, we propose a new design strategy that introduces an ionic framework via halide salts to both stabilize sulfonamide molecules and control their orientation, thereby enabling desirable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence. Following this concept, the first sulfonamide fluoride, KF&#183;[SO2(NH2)2], was successfully synthesized, with SO2(NH2)2 units firmly anchored in the KF lattice by K&#9472;O ionic and N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F hydrogen bonds. Remarkably, this crystal exhibits a unique and compact Cairo pentagonal configuration. Benefiting from its well&#8208;ordered structure, the crystal exhibits a strong SHG response of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm, a large birefringence of 0.079@546&#160;nm, and a short cutoff edge below 190&#160;nm. This work opens new avenues for the design of advanced NLO crystals with a sulfonamide group.

&lt;p&gt;The sulfonamide group (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) shows great potential for deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals due to its strong hyperpolarizability and anisotropy, but its neutrality and poor protonation limit its application. Here, we propose a new design strategy that introduces an ionic framework via halide salts to both stabilize sulfonamide molecules and control their orientation, thereby enabling desirable second-harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence. Following this concept, the first sulfonamide fluoride, KF&#183;[SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], was successfully synthesized, with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units firmly anchored in the KF lattice by K&#9472;O ionic and N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F hydrogen bonds. Remarkably, this crystal exhibits a unique and compact Cairo pentagonal configuration. Benefiting from its well-ordered structure, the crystal exhibits a strong SHG response of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm, a large birefringence of 0.079@546&#160;nm, and a short cutoff edge below 190&#160;nm. This work opens new avenues for the design of advanced NLO crystals with a sulfonamide group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction via Photoinduced Pd and Pd/Ir Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction is designed by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. Both (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;allyl skeletons are achievable and stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is realized.








Abstract
Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction typically relies on the use of alkenes containing an &#945;&#8208;leaving group as the substrates. In comparison, an in situ assembling model from feedstock chemicals represents a distinctive and practically valuable route, yet remains undeveloped. Here we report an unprecedented excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. With the development of a HAT/Heck/allylation cascade protocol, various (E)&#8208;allyl compounds are prepared in good yields and stereoselectivities. Meanwhile, a novel photoinduced Pd/Ir relay catalysis is designed to enable stereoselective preparation of challenging (Z)&#8208;allyl compounds. Stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is also realized via this excited&#8208;state Pd chemistry, different from typical ground&#8208;state catalytic models. A broad range of N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;derived nucleophiles and different alkenes and esters show high compatibility with the transformation. The protocol is further applied to the concise synthesis of seven bioactive molecules from bulk materials, highlighting the reliability, generality, and practical value of the design. Mechanistic studies support the present design.

         <title>A Highly Selective Nucleophilic and Radical Relay Difluorination of Cyclopropanes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and practical synthetic method has been realized for highly selective 1,3&#8208;difluorination of cyclopropanes and 1,2&#8208;difluorination of styrenes under mild conditions. Relay nucleophilic and radical fluorination allows for a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance.








Abstract
Fluoro&#8208;containing organic compounds have been found wide application in pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries and in medical diagnostics. In this field, the construction of C&#9472;F bonds through nucleophilic fluorination strategies remains highly challenging. Herein, we have developed a radical&#8208;polar strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced nucleophilic fluorination and subsequent radical fluorination, allowing for direct difluorination of cyclopropanes and styrenes under mild reaction conditions. It affords a series of structurally diverse, both 1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;difluorinated products in synthetically useful yields by means of &#8764;0.1 mol% of 4CzIPN as catalyst. Furthermore, only 3 equivalents of Et3N&#183;3HF are required to realize an efficient nucleophilic fluorination, while 1.7 equivalents of Selectfluor are used as the radical fluorinating source, demonstrating good functional group compatibility and thus can be applied in late&#8208;stage difluorination of complex molecules.

         <title>Quinuclidinium&#8208;Based Microporous Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microporous AEMs with extreme alkaline stability and confinement&#8208;induced high conductivity have been developed for water electrolysis. The presented membrane, poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip), exhibited high OH&#8722; conductivity and record&#8208;setting alkaline stability. The water electrolyzers configured with PTPQ&#8208;Trip can tolerate varied temperatures, current densities, alkaline concentrations, and operation interruptions, and operate continuously under high alkaline concentrations. This work promises the integration of renewable electricity for water electrolysis.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a promising green hydrogen production method; however, it is constrained by the moderate OH&#8722; conductivity and inadequate alkaline stability of anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Here we report a series of quinuclidinium&#8208;based AEMs with branched and microporous structures, achieving 99.95% OH&#8722; conductivity retention after 3100&#160;h in 10&#160;M NaOH at 80 &#176;C. By tuning the rigidity of the branching units to limit chain packing, micropores were created to enhance OH&#8722; transport, which improved the diffusion coefficient of OH&#8722; by 1.6 times within the poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip) membrane having the most rigid structure. An AEMWE configured with a PTPQ&#8208;Trip membrane and nickel&#8208;alloy catalysts can tolerate varied alkaline concentrations and deliver a hydrogen production current density of 2.8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in 5&#160;M KOH, which can be continuously operated at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 and 30 &#176;C for over 1200 h, with intentionally included stop/start interruptions. The assembled AEMWE demonstrated stable operation for 1400 h under alternating operational current densities and varying electrolyte temperatures. This work underscores the critical role of alkaline&#8208;resistant microporous AEMs and highlights the adaptability of AEMWE for hydrogen production using renewable electricity.

         <title>Regioselective Zr5 Nanocluster Photocatalyst for Precise Protein Editing Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster serves as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for regioselective oxidative cleavage and side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme protein. Upon UV irradiation, it generates reactive oxygens species (ROS), with reaction selectivity guided by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the cluster's positively charged surface and electrostatically negatively charged regions on the protein near the cleavage sites.








Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modifications on protein structure and function is of central importance in protein chemistry, necessitating precise and controlled methods for introducing such modifications. Herein, we report a strategy for regioselective chemical editing of a protein using a novel Zr5&#160;nanocluster&#160;as a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst. The&#160; [ZrIV5(&#956;&#9472;&#927;&#919;)2(&#956;&#9472;&#927;)2(&#956;3&#9472;&#927;)Cl2(H2O)6(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1&#8208;tBu&#8208;dihyde&#8208;O,O&#8242;,O&#8243;)5] (Zr5) cluster features a unique [Zr5O5] structural motif and&#160;its electronic structure and light absorption properties&#160;were fully analyzed and reproduced through Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory&#160;(DFT) calculations.&#160;Zr5&#160;exhibits exceptional photophysical properties, including the optical gap of 2.01&#160;eV, the lowest reported to date for a zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster. Under light irradiation at 370&#160;nm, Zr5&#160;mediates the&#160;regioselective cleavage and oxidative side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme, producing&#160;fragments which are ideal for middle&#8208;down proteomics applications. Combined DFT and experimental approaches indicate that Zr5&#160;efficiently produces reactive oxygen species that mediate protein oxidation and cleavage. Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr5&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.

Combined DFT and experimental approaches indicate that Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;efficiently produces reactive oxygen species that mediate protein oxidation and cleavage. Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predicting Reaction Feasibility and Selectivity of Aromatic C&#9472;H Thianthrenation with a QM&#8211;ML Hybrid Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the open&#8208;source machine learning model PATTCH, which predicts the reaction feasibility and site&#8208;selectivity of aromatic C&#9472;H thianthrenation reactions. The model was built using both literature data and newly generated experimental data. PATTCH makes accurate predictions within minutes, and we show its application in multiple case studies, including prospective experimental verification.








Abstract
The direct thianthrenation of aromatic C&#9472;H bonds is a valuable late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy that can assist, for example, the development of new drugs. We herein present a predictive computational model for this reaction, denoted PATTCH, which is based on semiempirical quantum mechanics and machine learning. It classifies each Caromatic&#8211;H unit either as reactive or not with an accuracy of above 90%. It can address both the site&#8208;selectivity and reaction feasibility question associated with the thianthrenation protocol. First, this was achieved by selecting carefully engineered features, which take into account the electronic and steric influence on the site&#8208;selectivity. Second, parallel experimentation was used to supplement the available literature data with 54 new negative reactions (unsuccessful thianthrenation), which we show was instrumental for developing the PATTCH tool. Ultimately, we successfully applied the model to a challenging test set encompassing the differentiation between carbocycle versus heterocycle functionalization, the identification of substrates that were reported to result in a mixture of isomeric products, and to molecules that could not be thianthrenated. The computational predictions were experimentally validated. The PATTCH tool can be obtained free of charge from https://github.com/MolecularAI/thianthrenation_prediction.

         <title>K+ Vacancies and Fluorine Substitution Synergistically Regulate KTiOPO4 Anode for All&#8208;Climate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode structure with synergistically regulated K+ vacancies and O/F disorder has been achieved through F substitution. Practical full&#8208;cell testing confirms that this material exhibits excellent cycling stability, enhanced rate performance, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Although Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode materials with robust structures exhibit advantages such as high reversibility and high Coulombic efficiency for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage; however, their practical application is restricted by drawbacks including limited storage sites, low capacity, and intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a strategy of fluorine substitution combined with carbon coating of KTiOPO4 (KTPF/C), along with the introduction of K+ vacancies to activate additional potassium storage sites. The resulting KTPF/C material demonstrates a high capacity of 204.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1, corresponding to the reversible storage of 1.27&#160;K+ ions. The synergistic effect of K+ vacancies and fluorine substitution not only lowers the operating voltage but also results in a more disordered structure, thereby reducing the volume change during potassiation/depotassiation to 7.3%. This enables an ultralong cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.011&#8240; per cycle. Moreover, the cooperation of K+ vacancies and carbon coating facilitates the transport of K+ and electrons, allowing the material to maintain excellent rate performance of 125.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1. Practical full&#8208;cell testing further confirms the material's outstanding cycling stability, high power density, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Acyclic Tripodal Receptors as Ultrahigh Superprotonic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of proton&#8208;conducting tripodal receptors, namely, Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P and Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P with differently functionalized tails have been designed to act as anchors for the intrinsically crystallized proton carrier (H3PO4/H2PO4&#8722;). Distinct variation in H&#8208;bonded architectures marked for 1000 times higher proton conductivity of Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) than that for Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P (3.08&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1) at 80 &#176;C under 80% RH.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state proton&#8208;conductors (SSPCs) with high conductivity and excellent chemical stability are the key requirements for proton exchange membrane fuel&#8208;cell systems. Herein, inspired by the acyclic supramolecular chemistry, we inaugurate a new class of proton&#8208;conducting tripodal receptor based hydrogen&#8208;bonded platforms, namely, Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P and Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P, with differently functionalized tails. The receptors act as anchors for the intrinsically crystallized proton carriers (H3PO4 and H2PO4&#8722;) through multiple host&#8208;guest interactions and thus eventually address leaching issues with externally doped phosphoric acid from SSPCs. Distinct variation in structural engineering through &#8220;complementary docking strategy&#8221; coupled with striking variation in H&#8208;bonded architectures (continuous versus closed loops) marked for three orders higher proton conductivity of Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) than that for Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P (3.08&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1) at 80 &#176;C under 80% RH. Quantum&#8208;chemical simulation revealed a smaller proton transfer energy barrier (EPT) in Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P (13.7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 and 1.7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 for channel&#8208;a and b, along with an energetically favourable &#8220;quantum tunnelling effect&#8221; in channel&#8208;b) than in Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P (24.9&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Such a unique framework engineering served as an effective tool for flaunting tripodal receptor Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P as a new zoner ultrahigh proton conducting platform (beyond&#160;&gt;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Reduction of Rare&#8208;Earth Stannole Sandwich Complexes to Tin&#8208;Based Radical Ligands and Tin&#8211;Tin Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

One&#8208;electron reduction of dimetallic rare&#8208;earth stannole complexes with KC8 produces a di&#8208;tin radical ligand that shows strong coupling between tin and yttrium, gadolinium or dysprosium. Two&#8208;electron reduction of the stannole complexes further populates a delocalized {M2Sn2} molecular orbital, enhancing the tin&#8211;tin bonding and simultaneously dearomatizing the stannole rings.








Abstract
f&#8208;Element organometallic chemistry is dominated by cyclopentadienyl ligands. In contrast, isoelectronic metallole ligands with the general formula [EC4R4]2&#8722;, where E is a heavier group 14 element, are rare in the f&#8208;block, particularly stannole ligands. Here, we describe the synthesis of the dimetallic stannole complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M&#160;; M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy; CpSn = [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt = [1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2]&#8722;), which form by virtue of Sn&#8594;M dative bonds. One&#8208;electron reduction of 1M with KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces the mono&#8208;anionic complexes [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M), and two&#8208;electron reduction gives di&#8208;anionic [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M) as [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts. Studies of the stannole complexes using crystallography, UV/vis and EPR spectroscopy, magnetometry and computational methods reveal that the reduction steps generate tin&#8211;tin bonds through population of a delocalized molecular orbital that spans the {M2Sn2} rings, with attendant dearomatization of the stannole rings. Complexes 2M are the first tin&#8208;radical ligands bound to rare earth elements. Spin density calculations of 2Y and 2Gd reveal significant build&#8208;up of unpaired spin on the tin atoms, with magnetic measurements on 2Gd yielding an unprecedentedly large tin&#8211;gadolinium exchange coupling constant of &#8722;112&#160;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2J formalism).

         <title>Electronic Structure&#8208;Engineered Proton Depletion Interfaces on Ternary RuO2 for Ultra&#8208;Stable Kilowatt Electrocatalysis</title>

Achieving kilowatt&#8208;level PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production by self&#8208;accelerating interfacial proton consumption through the creation of local operando alkaline microenvironments.








Abstract
Advancing high&#8208;current PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) is crucial for terawatt&#8208;scale green hydrogen economies, but anode catalyst stability under industrial conditions remains a key barrier to system efficiency and longevity. Here, we present a ternary RuO2&#8208;based catalyst (Cr0.1Sn0.1Ru0.8O2) that addresses these limitations through proton depletion interface engineering, with electronic structure modulation inherently integrated into the catalyst design. The resulting catalyst reaches a current density of 3.0 amperes per square centimeter at only 1.77 volts and a low degradation for oxygen evolution over 1000&#160;h in PEMWE. A scaled&#8208;up system incorporating this anode catalyst further attains a hundred&#8208;ampere level water electrolysis, with kilowatt scale which propels the large&#8208;scale deployment of hydrogen production utilizing renewable energy sources. Our techno&#8208;economic analysis predicts that leveraging this anode architecture can reduce hydrogen production costs below $1 per kg H2 while maintaining a substantially lower environmental footprint relative to conventional electrolyzer technologies.

         <title>Atomic Structure Design for Enhancing Metal&#8208;Support Frontier Orbital Interaction to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on atomic structure design, this study developed AuNPsNi1CN photocatalyst, a novel structure with defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal nanoparticle loading strategies. N vacancies enhance the metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between Ni single atoms and the g&#8208;C3N4, improving H+ supply capacity through 4e&#8722; WOR. Au nanoparticles serve as 2e&#8722; ORR sites, achieving an H2O2 yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water.








Abstract
Modified g&#8208;C3N4 has been widely applied in various photocatalytic reactions. However, designing efficient atomic structures, breaking through the activity bottleneck and elucidating the precise reaction mechanisms remain the critical challenges in photocatalyst development. This work developed one innovative photocatalyst atomic structure design (AuNPsNi1CN) with Ni single atoms, N vacancies and Au nanoparticles (NPs) at g&#8208;C3N4. N vacancies enhancing metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between the Ni electron orbitals and the g&#8208;C3N4&#8217;s frontier orbitals, forming a highly active site for four&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (4e&#8722; WOR), which significantly enhanced the proton (H&#8314;) supply capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the introduced Au NPs produce H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieving a yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Ni single atoms cause a regulation in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), enhancing the oxidation capability of holes, while the Au NPs optimize O2 adsorption energy and lower the reaction barrier for 2e&#8722; ORR. This atomic&#8208;scale structure design strategy combining defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal NPs loading, provides a novel approach for developing efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Formal C&#9472;H Functionalization of Quinolines at the C7 Position Through a Traceless Directing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the remote C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates has been achieved by using a traceless N&#8208;acyl directing group, providing an efficient and practical strategy for the synthesis of a new family of C7&#8208;functionalized quinolines with high regioselectivity.








Abstract
The precise C&#9472;H functionalization of quinolines is of high interest in organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, although many strategies have been developed for the regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization of the quinoline scaffold, the facile and selective remote C&#9472;H bond functionalization of quinolines at the geometrically and electronically disfavored C7&#8208;position has remained underdeveloped. Here, we disclose a Cu&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates. The reaction features exclusive C7&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, short reaction time, and simple operation. This practical protocol has also been applied in the analogous C7&#8208;H functionalization of tetrahydroquinolines and the further C7&#8208;elaboration of quinolines. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the key to the success of this transformation is the unique ring&#8208;size&#8208;induced in situ removal of the N&#8208;acyl directing group, constituting a traceless directing strategy for the rapid access to a variety of C7&#8208;substituted neutral quinolines.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regiodivergent Allyl&#8208;Propargyl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions for the Construction of 1,4&#8208;Enallenes and 1,5&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemo&#8208; and regiodivergent allyl&#8208;propargyl cross&#8208;coupling reactions of propargyl carbonates with allyl boronates has been realized. The role of ligands in determining both the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity is of particular importance, as they modulate the 1,1&#8242;&#8208; or 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination mode from the same &#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;allenylpalladium intermediate.








Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent transformations represent a vital strategy for the efficient production of structurally diverse molecules from the same readily available precursors. Herein, we report the palladium/phosphine&#8208;catalyst&#8208;driven chemo&#8208; and regiodivergent allyl&#8208;propargyl cross&#8208;coupling of propargyl carbonates with allyl boronates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the bidentate phosphine ligand plays a crucial role in determining the relative favorability of possible reductive elimination modes from the &#414;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#414;1&#8208;allenyl palladium intermediate species. Specifically, MeO&#8208;BIPHEP facilitates the 1,1&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination to form the 1,4&#8208;enallenes; in contrast, XantPhos favors the formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes through a 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination pathway.

         <title>Cupin&#8208;Type Dimethylsulfoniopropionate Lyase from Pelagibacter ubique (DddKPu) Catalyzes Aza&#8208;Michael Addition of Primary and Secondary Amines to Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase (DddK) was identified as an efficient aza&#8208;Michaelase for the addition of amines to acrylate. Screening 74 amines with wild&#8208;type DddK and its W26G variant yielded N&#8208;substituted and N,N&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;amino acids in 30%&#8211;93% isolated yield. This versatile method enables access to novel &#946;&#8208;amino acids, which serve as valuable building blocks for pharmaceutical synthesis.








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#9472;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis, underpinning the production of amines, imines, and nitriles found in numerous active ingredients. Among the methods for C&#9472;N bond formation, the aza&#8208;Michael addition stands out as a powerful and versatile approach. Herein, we present a biocatalytic strategy for the efficient aza&#8208;Michael addition of primary and secondary amines to acrylic acid, i.e., aza&#8208;Michaelase activity, leveraging the promiscuity of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase from Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 (DddKPu). In vivo DddKPu catalyzes the &#946;&#8208;elimination of DMSP to sodium acrylate and dimethylsulfide (i.e., a retro sulfa&#8208;Michael reaction). Here, we screened DddKPu against a diverse library of 30 primary and 44 secondary amines. The wild&#8208;type enzyme achieved 90%&#8211;100% conversion and 40%&#8211;86% isolated yields of N,N&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids with secondary amines. For primary amines, the W26G variant proved optimal, furnishing 50%&#8211;100% conversion and 43%&#8211;81% isolated yields of N&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Notably, the enzyme exhibited remarkable chemoselectivity: for pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, the reaction occurred exclusively at the secondary amine, while for piperidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, it reacted selectively at the primary amine. These findings highlight DddKPu as a versatile biocatalyst for the selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids, expanding the toolbox for C&#9472;N bond formation.

         <title>A Heterodimetallic Monomeric Complex with a Uranium&#8211;Cobalt Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a crystallographically confirmed heterodimetallic monomeric complex (TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co) featuring a U&#8801;Co triple bond (2.189&#160;&#197;). Remarkably, this complex could act as a catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkyne.








Abstract
The crystal structure of heterodimetallic monomeric complexes featuring a U&#8211;M triple bond has been rarely reported. Here, we present an example of a heterodimetallic monomeric complex [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co)] (4) containing a U&#8211;Co triple bond, which was synthesized by the reaction of [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Cl)] (2) or [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U] (3) with CoCl2 in the presence of KC8. The crystal structure of 4 reveals a highly&#160;symmetrical&#160;geometry with a linear Co&#8211;U&#8211;Namine axis line, and the U&#8211;Co bond length 2.1890(11) &#197; is slightly longer than the sum of the covalent triple&#8208;bond radii of uranium and cobalt (2.14&#160;&#197;). The U&#8211;Namine bond length (2.439(6) &#197;) is significantly shortened compared to that of precursors 2 and 3. The significant contraction of the U&#8211;Namine bond demonstrates electronic reinforcement via the inverse trans&#8208;influence (ITI). Detailed computational investigations further support the existence of a U&#8801;Co triple bond in 4, and the formal oxidation states of uranium and cobalt appear to be U(IV) and Co(&#8208;I). The low&#8208;temperature magnetic moments of 4 are approaching 2.1 &#956;B, which is attributed to its near&#8208;doubly degenerate spin&#8208;orbit ground states in the pseudo&#8208;C3v symmetry. Remarkably, 4 served as the catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkynes under mild conditions.

         <title>Biomedical Applications of Nanozymes: An Enzymology Perspective</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a lens of enzymology, this review compares nanozymes with enzymes using the Michaelis&#8208;Menten model and differences in KM and kcat along with catalysis in complex biological environment. The implications of these differences in biomedical applications of nanozymes are then described with a statistical analysis of the trend of therapeutic use of nanozymes. 








Abstract
Nanozymes are catalytic nanomaterials that transform enzyme substrates into their corresponding products, offering enhanced stability and a cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional enzymes. As nanomaterials, they possess unique physicochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms distinct from those of enzymes. Such differences have profound, yet often neglected, implications in biomedical applications. In the context of enzymology, this review compares nanozymes and enzymes, with a focus on redox reactions. This review begins with the classification of nanozymes based on the types of reactions they catalyze, with the ability to exhibit multiple catalytic activities being a prevalent characteristic. The use of the Michaelis&#8208;Menten model for both enzymes and nanozymes is discussed in detail, and the Michaelis constant, maximum reaction rate, and turnover number values are compared. The performance of nanozymes in crowded environments and under extreme conditions is also compared to that of enzymes. We discuss the kinetic factors influencing nanozyme performance, the impact of active site shielding, and the activity under non&#8208;physiological conditions. We then compiled recent trends in the biomedical applications of nanozymes, focusing on both the production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. This review links fundamental enzymology to nanozyme catalysis, providing a key reference for the rational use of nanozymes.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Homing Liposomal Nanobot for Active Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the optimal activity of glucose oxidase (GOD) at pH 5.5 and lower pH values in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a self&#8208;homing GOD&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) was designed. This nanorobotic system can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) through &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis and pH&#8208;guided chemotactic motion, achieving a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency for enhanced glioblastoma (GBM) chemotherapy. 








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a substantial obstacle in therapy since the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) severely prevent the access of most exogenous therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Overcoming this dual defense established by BBB&#8208;TME is a critical challenge in GBM therapy. Here, we present a glucose oxidase (GOD)&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) to breach the BBB&#8208;TME through self&#8208;homing navigation guided by the acid and glucose in TME&#8212;a mechanism rooted in the regulation of GOD activity, with optimal performance in acidic environments to actively deliver drugs for GBM chemotherapy. The lipoNbot features an asymmetric structure composed of GOD&#8208;modified cancer cell membranes and &#947;&#8208;glutamylated lipids, which synergistically enhance BBB&#8208;TME penetration through chemotactic diffusiophoresis and &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis. The proton sponge effect facilitates lysosomal escape for BBB traversal. In vivo investigation indicates that lipoNbots achieve a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency. Such a lipoNbot poses the specific biochemical cues of GBM for self&#8208;homing navigation, establishing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept framework utilizing the pathological features for active therapy of central nervous system diseases.

         <title>A Photothermal Nano&#8208;Switch for Tumor&#8208;Selective Wnt Hyperactivation in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) is presented for precise, spatiotemporal modulation of Wnt signaling. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis.








Abstract
Wnt signaling plays a paradoxical role in cancer, functioning as both a promoter and suppressor depending on its activation level. This duality underscores the critical need for precise and selective modulation, while existing Wnt&#8208;targeting strategies fail to achieve it due to inadequate specificity and control. Here, we report a photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) that enables spatiotemporal and selective activation of the Wnt pathway. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, localized heating disrupts Wif1&#8208;Wnt interactions, triggering controlled Wnt protein release. The liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis. In contrast, normal cells remain unaffected due to their lower basal Wnt activity, as confirmed by negligible cytotoxicity and unaltered apoptotic markers. In vivo, this system achieves robust antitumor effects in a 4T1 breast cancer model while ensuring safety for healthy tissues. By leveraging the optical properties of gold nanorods for conditional and selective activation, this study establishes a transformative platform for the precise modulation of Wnt signaling, offering significant promise for treating Wnt&#8208;dysregulated diseases with minimal off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Split Personality in Polymer with Intrinsic Microporosity&#8208;Based Artificial Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral building blocks have been employed to construct chiral polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM), serving as the foundation for artificial ion channels. This approach has resulted in distinct configurations and contrasting ion transport behaviors, governed by the constituent chiral blocks. This work presents a split personality in a multifunctional, chiral PIM&#8208;based artificial ion channel system while marking the first application of chiral polymers in transmembrane transport.








Abstract
The construction of artificial transmembrane ion channels using polymers has emerged as a promising research avenue in membrane transport. In this study, we have designed and synthesized an intriguing class of intrinsically microporous chiral polyimides (PIM&#8208;PIs) employing trans/cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexanes (DACH) as structural building blocks. Remarkably, these chiral PIM&#8208;PIs exhibit distinct configurations, leading to contrasting ion transport properties. The cis&#8208;DACH&#8208;derived chiral polymer 1 demonstrates the hitherto highest Li+ transport activity (&gt;100 pS), along with exceptionally high selectivity ratios for Li+/Na+ (17.1) and Li+/K+ (21.8). In contrast, chiral polymers 2a and 2b, synthesized from (1R,2R)&#8208;DACH and (1S,2S)&#8208;DACH, respectively, showcase pronounced anion transport capabilities and a remarkably high Cl&#8722;/K+ selectivity ratio of 17.6. This work introduces a multifunctional, chiral PIM&#8208;based artificial ion channel system with a &#8220;split personality&#8221; governed by its chiral constituents. It represents the first application of chiral polymers in transmembrane transport, inspiring innovative design strategies for developing polymer&#8208;based artificial ion channels.

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions Modulate RNA:DNA Folding Observed via Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state nanopores enable the detection of RNA species at the single&#8208;molecule level. To rapidly and accurately identify barcoded RNAs as they translocate the pore, it is imperative to reduce analyte folding. Here, we demonstrate that RNA's supramolecular interactions with urea inhibit folding, increasing the number of readable barcodes while decreasing the number of events required for RNA identification. 








Abstract
DNA and RNA nanotechnology enables the precise assembly of molecular architectures, with applications in bioengineering, supramolecular chemistry, and sensing. The material properties of these biopolymers can be adjusted covalently or, more simply, through non&#8208;covalent interactions with small molecules. Herein, we demonstrate the use of urea, an abundant and inexpensive small molecule, to modulate the stiffness of RNA:DNA hybrid nanostructures. Our results suggest that supramolecular interactions between urea and the A&#8208;form&#8208;like helix rigidify the hybrid polymers, as evidenced by both solid&#8208;state nanopore measurements and atomic force microscopy. Nanopore sensing reveals that preparing topologically&#8208;barcoded RNA:DNA hybrids in urea results in a 50% reduction in folded translocations. This decrease in folded events improves the proportion of useable data points, paving the way for the robust detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA analytes at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Reductive Regeneration on Cobalt Catalysts Enables Efficient Dual&#8208;Pathway Hydrazine Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway mechanism is unveiled for hydrazine oxidation on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and a mediated pathway involving Co(II)/Co(0) cycling. Defect engineering accelerates the chemical reduction of Co(II) by hydrazine, enabling rapid regeneration of Co(0) active site, boosting both activity and durability, and leading to efficient low&#8208;voltage hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) represents a promising low&#8208;energy pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, yet mechanistic ambiguities and catalyst instability hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we elucidate the dual&#8208;pathway nature of HzOR on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation via the redox cycle between metallic Co and cobalt hydroxide species. This mechanistic insight moves beyond the traditional focus on solely enhancing the intrinsic activity in the direct pathway. Instead, it highlights the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a central process that not only regenerates metallic Co sites for direct pathway but also drives the mediated oxidation route. Guided by this understanding, we designed a defect&#8208;rich cobalt catalyst through a one&#8208;step electrodeposition method, enabling fast chemical reduction of oxidized Co species by hydrazine. As a result, the catalyst delivers superior HzOR performance, reaching a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only &#8722;79&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, along with outstanding long&#8208;term stability. Combined electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that defect engineering significantly promotes the dual&#8208;pathway HzOR on Co&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides mechanistic understanding of HzOR electrocatalysis and highlights a general strategy for designing efficient, durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts.

         <title>Polyanion Electrointercalation Enables Termination&#8208;Tailored Oligolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis in Alkali Chloroaluminate Melt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile non&#8208;destructive polyanion (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;) electrointercalation strategy was developed to synthesize facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx (T&#160;=&#160;&#8722;Cl, &#8722;NH, &#8722;Br). The as&#8208;delaminated oligolayer Ti3C2Clx sheets retained their pristine features of oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination, along with long cycling performance of 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 when serving as a coating material for Zn anode.








Abstract
Tailoring surface chemistry and achieving non&#8208;destructive interlayer exfoliation are crucial for controlling MXene properties. Conventional synthesis strategies typically involve damaging intercalation processes and yield MXenes with mixed surface terminations, compromising their functionality. Herein, we propose an anodic etching strategy to produce facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx from Ti3AlC2 in low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;chloroaluminate (AlCl3&#8208;NaCl&#8208;KCl) melts at 170&#160;&#176;C through the in situ electrochemical intercalation of polyanions (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;1). Oligolayer Ti3C2Clx (MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx) was readily achieved via further gently exfoliating the etching product, preserving the original surface chemistry featuring oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination. As functional coatings, MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx significantly extended the cycling lifespan of Zn anodes to 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to the tailored surface chemistry and oligolayer&#8208;induced ordered alignment that enabled efficient Zn2+ capture and uniform deposition. The strategy's versatility was also demonstrated by tailoring terminations (e.g., &#8722;Br, &#8722;NH) via molten salt composition engineering, providing a non&#8208;destructive pathway for MXene surface engineering and interlayer delamination, thereby unlocking their full potential for advanced energy applications.

         <title>Na2Fe3(SO4)4: A Zero&#8208;Strain Sustainable Positive Electrode Material for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sustainable zero&#8208;strain Na2Fe3(SO4)4 (NFS) positive electrode material is obtained by only ball&#8208;milling from cheap and available Na2SO4 and FeSO4. Iron coordination polyhedra include the Fe2O11 dimer of distorted octahedra (active during cycling) and FeO5 trigonal bipyramid, similar to that in the relative Pbca&#8208;Na2Mn3(SO4)4 (NMS). Unlike the Mn&#8208;based phase, NFS delivered 62 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with high&#8208;thick loaded electrodes at an average voltage of 3.34&#160;V versus Na+/Na.








Abstract
One of the challenges in the energy transition is minimization of the battery cost for energy grid storage. Na&#8208;ion batteries are a promising alternative to Li&#8208;based analogues thanks to low cost, abundance of constituents, and an already set&#8208;up industry. However, already commercialized positive electrode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries (Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaxCu1&#8208;y&#8208;zFeyMnzO2) contain critical raw elements such as V, Cu, and Mn, boosting the research towards abundant Fe&#8208;based materials. In this work, we report a novel sodium iron sulfate phase, Na2Fe3(SO4)4 (NFS), synthesized by ball milling, as a positive electrode material. This new compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group with cell parameters a = 9.682(1) &#197;, b = 8.739(1) &#197;, c = 29.300(4) &#197;, and V = 2479.0(5) &#197;3. Tests of thick NFS positive electrodes (18 mg cm&#8722;2) in Na&#8208;half coin cells delivered 62 mAh g&#8722;1 at C/30 (corresponding to the exchange of 2 e&#8208;) or 69% of the theoretical capacity (90 mAh g&#8722;1), with a good capacity retention of 47 mAh g&#8722;1 at a high discharge rate 2C. Operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) showed minimal (&lt;1%) changes in lattice parameters during cycling. Dominantly octahedra coordinated iron atoms are oxidized/reduced, as confirmed by operando synchrotron M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy.

         <title>Alloying Small&#8208;Cation into Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Motif Gives Multiaxial Ferroelectrics with Enhanced Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a series of multiaxial bismuth&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics with organic mixed&#8208;cations, of which the most active candidate enables the photocurrent enhancement ratio reaches up to 4800%, far beyond those known ferroelectrics. This work affords a new avenue for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photoactive ferroelectrics have shown huge potentials for assembling high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Bismuth&#8208;based halides are emerging as a vigor ferroelectric subclass due to unique structural diversity and flexibility, while studies on their photo&#8208;ferroelectricity coupling remain extremely scarce. Here, we have alloyed organic mixed&#8208;cations into Bismuth&#8208;based prototype to design a series of new multiaxial ferroelectrics with strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity, as notably exemplified by (BZA)2(DMA)BiBr6 (1, where BZA is benzylammounium; DMA is dimethylammounium). The dynamic motions of small DMA+ cation afford the driving force to trigger symmetry breaking of 3&#175;mFm$\bar 3m{\rm F}m $, thus giving its multiaxial ferroelectricity with 6 equivalent polarization directions. Strikingly, 1 exhibits photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a broad ultraviolet&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral range (266&#8211;980&#160;nm), which couples with ferroelectric bulk photovoltaics to create giant photocurrent enhancement ratio of &#8764;4800%. This merit far surpasses those of known ferroelectric materials. These results shed light on the design of new photoactive ferroelectric candidates for smart photoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbon via High&#8208;Pressure Topochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positioning sp3&#8208;CH and N atoms at specific sites can quasi&#8208;continuously tune the bandgap of [8]&#8208;AGNR. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder polymerization, we synthesized site&#8208;specific sp3&#8208;CH and N co&#8208;substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs and modified the bandgap precisely. Our work provides a general and controllable one&#8208;step synthesis method for producing various [8]&#8208;AGNRs with site&#8208;specific heteroatom substitution.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted broad attention for their potential application in nanoelectronics. The electronic properties of the GNRs are closely related to their chemical structure like width, edge, terminating and hetero atoms, etc., and widely applied synthetic methods for the scalable synthesis of specific GNRs with atom&#8208;scale precision are urgently required. Here, we found that the stoichiometric and ordered positioning of N and sp3&#8208;CH in 8&#8208;armchair&#8208;GNR ([8]&#8208;AGNR) effectively modifies their bandgap in a large range of 0&#8211;2.85&#160;eV by theoretical calculations. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder polymerization, three of these [8]&#8208;AGNRs were synthesized successfully in their bulk phase starting from crystalline dipyridinyl/dipyrimidinyl butadiynes, with the maximum nitrogen content of 27% in mass. The structures of these GNRs were demonstrated by spectroscopy, diffraction, transmission electron microscope, pair distribution function, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance methods. UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance spectra clearly evidenced the precise tuning of the electronic structures in these N and CH substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs. Our work shows great versatility of this high&#8208;pressure topochemical synthetic strategy in synthesizing GNRs with site&#8208;specific N and sp3&#8208;CH substitutions. This strategy can also be applied to synthesizing more structure&#8208;specific carbon nano&#8208;materials.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Molecular Stabilization of Spacer Cation&#8208;Mediated Aging Dynamics in Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Precursors Enables Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unraveling spacer cation&#8208;mediated degradation in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, this work introduces 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB) as a dual&#8208;functional stabilizer. CFB stabilizer suppresses spacer cation degradation and coordinates multi&#8208;stage crystallization. The corresponding precursor delivers extended shelf life and devices achieve a record&#8208;low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV.








Abstract
The aging dynamics of perovskite precursor solutions critically govern the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, the underlying degradation mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors remain elusive, particularly regarding the pivotal role of spacer cations in modulating decomposition pathways. This study elucidates the intrinsic aging mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, revealing that spacer cation integration fundamentally governs decomposition kinetics. A dual&#8208;functional solution stabilizer, 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB), is strategically designed to concurrently mitigate precursor degradation and regulate crystallization dynamics. The carboxyl moiety undergoes spontaneous deprotonation to establish robust hydrogen bonds with guanidinium (GA+), effectively suppressing methylamine (MA0)&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attacks and preventing irreversible addition&#8208;elimination reactions between GA+ and MA0. Simultaneously, CFB orchestrates multi&#8208;stage crystallization control through coordination modulation, yielding highly oriented perovskite crystals with passivated grain boundaries. The optimized devices demonstrate exceptional photovoltaic performance with a remarkably low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV. Notably, devices fabricated from aged precursors maintain 90% of initial efficiency over 42 days of ambient storage. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices deliver optimized humidity stability and thermal stability.

         <title>Solvent Chain&#8208;Length Engineering Enables All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte is designed by combining short&#8208;chain ethers for fast ion transport with long&#8208;chain glycol ethers to improve thermal and voltage stability, together with DOL and FEC additives. This strategy balances ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, thermal robustness, voltage tolerance, and low&#8208;temperature adaptability, enabling sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast charging, long cycle life, and wide&#8208;temperature operation.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;rate capability, long&#8208;term cycling stability, high&#8208;voltage tolerance, and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains a challenge due to intrinsic solvent trade&#8208;offs. Here, we propose a molecular&#8208;scale electrolyte design strategy addressing this multi&#8208;objective optimization through solvent chain&#8208;length engineering. By coupling short&#8208;chain ethers (low&#8208;temperature kinetics) and long&#8208;chain glycol ethers (high&#8208;voltage/thermal stability) with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), we construct a hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte that redefines Na&#8314; solvation chemistry. Systematic solvent&#8211;solvent interaction modulation weakens Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent binding to accelerate ion transport, while FEC&#8208;induced anion&#8208;rich coordination shells enhance interfacial stability. The hybrid electrolyte enables Na3V2(PO4)3||Na cells to deliver an 82.75 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity after 9500 cycles at 10 C, sustain 600&#8208;day operation at 1 C, and function across &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. Symmetric Na||Na cells demonstrate stable cycling for over one year. Moreover, the electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with various commercial cathode materials within a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8211;4.5&#160;V and demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in full&#8208;cell systems. This work demonstrates solvent chain&#8208;length&#8208;driven solvation engineering as a viable strategy to concurrently address kinetic, thermodynamic, and interfacial challenges, offering a practical pathway toward all&#8208;climate SIBs with balanced multi&#8208;performance metrics.

         <title>Catalytic Stereoselective Silyl&#8208; and Boraformylations: Charting a Challenging Road Ahead</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights advances in silyl&#8208; and boraformylation&#8212;CHO and silyl/boryl additions to unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds. While silylformylation has matured, boraformylation remains early&#8208;stage. Enantioselective variants are still elusive, offering key opportunities to develop catalysts for accessing stereochemically complex molecules. 








Abstract
This minireview highlights key milestone discoveries in (stereoselective) silylformylation and boraformylation reactions&#8212;formal additions of a formyl group (CHO) and a silyl or boryl group across unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds, such as those in alkenes, dienes, alkynes, or allene derivatives. Although these transformations have not yet reached the level of maturity of the parent hydroformylation reaction (the addition of CHO and H across an unsaturated C&#9472;C bond), significant progress has nonetheless been achieved. This minireview presents the current state of the art in silylformylation catalysis, emphasizing the chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities achieved by leading catalytic systems. In contrast, boraformylation remains in its infancy, with only a handful of examples reported in the literature to date. Notably, catalytic enantioselective variants of both silyl&#8208; and boraformylation reactions have yet to be realized. This limited progress is primarily attributed to the scarcity of catalysts that effectively combine a metal center with a suitable ligand framework. This minireview article underscores the significant opportunities for advancing catalytic enantioselective methodologies in these areas and the potential for accessing structurally diverse, stereochemically complex molecules through these underdeveloped yet promising transformations.

         <title>Enhanced Bifunctional Catalysis of Iridium Nanoparticles on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Holey Carbon via Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the successful synthesis of Ir nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;doped holey carbon (NHC) as a high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Strong metal&#8211;support interactions between Ir and NHC effectively control the size and electronic structure of the Ir nanoparticles, leading to superior catalytic activity compared to commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts.








Abstract
Developing efficient and durable catalysts is crucial for the practical application of energy storage and conversion technologies. This work reports the synthesis of iridium nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped holey carbon (Ir&#8208;NHC), which exhibit outstanding performance in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to impressive device performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Compared to commercial Pt/C&#160;+&#160;Ir/C, Ir&#8208;NHC demonstrates a 1.6&#8208;fold higher specific capacity (862.5 mAh g&#8722;1 versus 536.9 mAh g&#8722;1), a similar power density of 120.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, and remarkable cycling stability (2000 cycles versus &#8764;32 cycles). A series of X&#8208;ray&#8208;based spectroscopic characterizations reveal a strong metal&#8211;support interaction between the Ir nanoparticles and the NHC support. This interaction enables precise control over the size and electronic structure of the Ir nanoparticles. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure studies conducted at various OER potentials demonstrate that the electronic structure of Ir and the adsorption process of OER intermediates are optimized by this interaction, leading to the observed excellent catalytic activity and stability of Ir&#8208;NHC.

         <title>Polymeric Diaminophenazine with Spiral Architecture as Cathode Materials for Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a spiral&#8208;structured polymer, poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) (p&#8208;DAP), with alternating aromatic/alicyclic rings. Its interlayer curvature and electronic delocalization synergistically enable fast charge transport, yielding superior energy storage in aqueous Znic&#8208;organic batteries at both ambient and low temperatures.








Abstract
Pyrazine&#8208;based organic electrode materials hold great promise for applications in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), while developing cost&#8208;effective organic molecules that exhibit both high electrochemical activity and long cycle life remains challenging. Herein, we report an&#160;organic polymer (p&#8208;DAP) featuring alternating rigid&#8208;flexible spiral structures for AZIBs. Synthesized from cost&#8208;effective o&#8208;phenylenediamine via thermal polymerization, p&#8208;DAP integrates saturated alicyclic rings and pyrazine moieties to stabilize interlayer spacing and facilitate ion transport. The polymer achieves nearly 95% redox&#8208;active sites utilization at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, delivering 145.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 78.9%&#160;over 136 900 cycles. Notably, it maintains a capacity retention of 97.7% after 3550 cycles at &#8211;40&#160;&#176;C. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal a proton&#8208;dominated charge storage mechanism. This work offers a promising strategy for designing durable organic electrodes for high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Molecular Weight Control in Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) of gradient thermoplastics with varying levels of control derived from both linear and nonlinear (spiral) fronts. 








Abstract
In this study, we push the limits of bulk frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) to control polymer molecular weight and dispersity without the need for solvents, deoxygenation, or post&#8208;polymerization purification. By tuning inhibitor loadings and introducing inhibitory comonomers, we enable enhanced control over molecular weight (39&#8211;700&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) and achieve dispersity as low as &#208; = 1.07, surpassing previous limitations while preserving the thermal properties of the materials. This increased inhibition also leads to the first demonstration of closed&#8208;mold, nonlinear propagation modes (i.e., spin modes) in FROMP of norbornene&#8208;type monomers, where the reaction front spirals down the tube, revealing the intricate interplay between thermal transport, reaction kinetics, and gravitational effects. Furthermore, we constructed materials with gradient compositions and spatially defined variations in molecular weight, dispersity, composition, and patterning. These advances position controlled FROMP as a powerful tool for rapid, scalable, and self&#8208;regulating material design, merging the fields of controlled polymerization and self&#8208;propagating material manufacturing.

         <title>Can Charge Transfer Across C&#9472;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Hydrogen Bonds Stabilize Oil Droplets in Water?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer of electron density from water to oil and accompanying dynamic polarization has been suggested to explain stability of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions. Energy decomposition analysis at the water&#8211;hexane interface shows that forward and backward charge transfer nearly cancel, yielding a negligible interfacial charge density inconsistent with emulsion stability and conductivity needed for electrophoretic mobility.








Abstract
Oil&#8211;water emulsions resist aggregation due to the presence of negative charges at their surface that leads to mutual repulsion between droplets, but the molecular origin of oil charge is currently under debate. Although much evidence has suggested that ionic species must accumulate at the interface, an alternative perspective attributes the negative charge on the oil droplet to charge transfer of electron density from water to oil molecules. Although the charge transfer mechanism is consistent with the correct sign of oil charge, it is just as important to provide good estimates of the charge magnitude to explain emulsion stability and electrophoresis experiments. Here, we show using energy decomposition analysis that the amount of net flow of charge from water to oil is negligibly small due to nearly equal forward and backward charge transfer through weak oil&#8211;water interactions, such that oil droplets would be unstable and coalesce, contrary to experiment. The lack of charge transfer also explains why vibrational sum frequency scattering reports a blue shift in the oil C&#8211;H frequency when forming emulsions with water, which arises from Pauli repulsion due to localized confinement at the interface. Finally, unlike ions, neither charge transfer nor dynamic polarization can produce a finite conductivity needed to couple to electric fields that would explain electrophoretic&#160;mobility.

         <title>Impact of Glycoclustering on Stiffening of MUC5AC Peptides Revealed by High&#8208;Efficiency Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides featuring a previously unattained degree of glycoclustering were obtained by fully automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis in 1,3&#8208;dioxolane/Tween&#8208;20 and diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligation. Circular Dichroism (CD) and Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) measurements of densely GalNAcylated MUC5AC multi&#8208;tandem repeat peptides provided insights into the correlation between the occupancy of O&#8208;glycosylation sites and stiffening of the peptide backbone.








Abstract
Clustered O&#8208;glycosylation of long tandem repeat regions is the hallmark of secreted mucins such as MUC5AC. Glycosylation is thought to play a key role in rigidifying the peptide backbone. The synthesis of peptides containing extended O&#8208;glycosylation clusters has proven challenging, thus limiting studies on the influence of glycoclustering on peptide structure. Here, we report an efficient glyco&#8208;economic synthesis of peptides featuring a previously unattained degree of glycoclustering. The method is based on a fully automated, DMF&#8208;free solid&#8208;phase synthesis employing the solvent 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) in all steps. The addition of Tween&#8208;20 enabled fast couplings of and to GalNAcylated amino acids by using only 0.5 excess equivalents at room temperature. Five tandem repeats long MUC5AC glycopeptides containing up to 30 GalNAc residues (100% occupancy of potential glycosylation sites) were accessed by Diselenide&#8211;Selenoester Ligation and selective deselenization in the presence of terminal cysteine residues. Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements showed that progressive GalNAcylation shifts the conformational equilibrium from the random coil to the extended polyproline type II helix conformation. Pulsed Electron&#8211;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy measurements revealed a significant stiffening of the MUC5AC peptide backbone upon GalNAcylation of four or six amino acids in each octad repeat.

Pulsed Electron&#8211;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy measurements revealed a significant stiffening of the MUC5AC peptide backbone upon GalNAcylation of four or six amino acids in each octad repeat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Optimized Film&#8208;Forming Processes Lead to Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Modules Fabricated with Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the extended nucleation and crystal growth time by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20&#8208;based organic solar cells (0.0476&#160;cm2) and modules (19.44&#160;cm2) processed from m&#8208;xylene achieve high efficiencies of 19.04% and 16.71%, respectively.








Abstract
While the transition from halogenated to eco&#8208;friendly processing solvents is vital for the industrialization of organic solar cells (OSCs), obtaining ideal morphology of active layer during green fabrication of the device remains a challenge. To address this issue, the famous polymer donor of PM6 is chemically modified through the introduction of 20% chlorinated dithiazole (Tz2Cl) segment into the mainchain. It is found that, the obtained terpolymer, PM6&#8208;ClTz20, shows the improved solubility in the non&#8208;halogenated solvent of m&#8208;xylene. More importantly, Tz2Cl units induce the enlarged electrostatic potential difference between PM6&#8208;ClTz20 and the acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9, giving donor&#8211;acceptor electrostatic attraction. This prolongs the nucleation and crystal growth time of donor and acceptor in m&#8208;xylene solution, endowing the blend film with fine phase&#8208;separated domains and bigger crystal size. Consequently, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20:BTP&#8208;eC9 binary system yields outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.04% and 16.71% for the small&#8208;area device (0.0476&#160;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (19.44&#160;cm2), respectively. This work clarifies the key role of donor&#8211;acceptor interaction in regulating the film&#8208;forming process and optimizing blend morphology, providing a feasible route to sustainable and scalable OSCs.

         <title>Partitioning COF Membrane Channels into Ultramicroporous and &#960;&#8208;Electron&#8208;Rich Compartments for Multicomponent Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Channel partition has been achieved in two novel alkynyl COF membranes by using click chemistry, which results in an ultramicroporous configuration as well as concentrated charge distribution. The resultant COF membranes are capable of efficiently separating multi&#8208;cation mixtures and multi&#8208;anion mixtures.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) build a versatile platform for constructing separation membranes, affording them disruptive candidates for nanoscale molecule/ion sieving. However, the reported aperture of COFs mainly concentrates on 0.8&#8211;10.0&#160;nm, leaving a daunting challenge in fabrication of ultramicroporous (&lt;0.7&#160;nm) COF membranes. Herein, the channel partition of COF membranes is elaborately implemented by taking advantage of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) based on click chemistry. Two kinds of novel alkynyl COF membranes bearing symmetric alkynyl monomers are predesigned and synthesized. The alkynyl groups can react with dual&#8208;azide molecules to form triazole ring bridge, which allows the partition of hexagonal or tetragonal channels. Moreover, the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich structures of triazole ring offer cation&#8208;philic or anion&#8208;repulsive region, showing great potentials in precise ion separations. Consequently, the superior performance is obtained in separating ternary/binary ion mixtures: Li+/Mg2+/(K+) and F&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/(Cl&#8722;). Example of dealing with a K+/Li+/Mg2+ ternary mixture, the optimum p&#8208;TpPa&#8208;C&#8801;CH membrane exhibits an actual selectivity of 101.2 for K+/Mg2+ and 30.9 for Li+/Mg2+. The strong adaptability and wide range of application scenarios of our COF membranes exceed the ever&#8208;reported membranes. This work provides a fundamental to comprehending the channel manipulation mechanisms and advances the development of high&#8208;performance ion separation membranes.

         <title>Multidentate Macrocyclic Salphen&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework with abundant accessible metal sites has been synthesized by coordination of a Salphen macrocycle with Cu2+ ions. The resulting SM&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu shows an exceptional performance as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.6% for ethylene production at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under a continuous pure acetylene feed.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous materials with promising electrochemical applications. The design of novel organic ligands for constructing 2D c&#8208;MOFs remains a crucial research frontier. While the incorporation of macrocycle blocks into 2D c&#8208;MOFs can introduce intrinsic cavities with advantageous properties, most existing reports are limited to coordinating with only one equivalent metal ion per macrocyclic cavity. In this work, we developed a triangular&#8208;shaped Salphen macrocycle&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF (SM&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu) featuring multidentate internal coordination sites. SM&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu exhibits high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and abundant accessible metal sites. Remarkably, this material demonstrates exceptional performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene (E&#8208;HAE), achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 96.6% for ethylene production at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under continuous pure acetylene feed. This study not only broadens the family of macrocycle&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOFs but also provides new insights into their potential for advanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Catalytic Strategies for Stereoselective Carbohydrate Synthesis: Emerging Concepts for Accessing Challenging Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent developments in catalytic stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis are presented. The converging synthetic trajectories of the catalytic and carbohydrate communities are discussed, including impactful case studies exemplifying noncovalent catalysis, radical catalysis, asymmetric catalysis and new catalytic modalities.








Abstract
The development of innovative catalytic strategies for stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis is rapidly emerging as a theme of general synthetic interest. This research frontier is fuelled by current realization that anomeric and site&#8208;selectivity challenges encountered in carbohydrate chemistry are indeed fascinating fundamental synthetic questions, still yet to be satisfactorily addressed. Although specialist carbohydrate chemistry and catalysis developed largely independently over the past three decades, growing recognition of carbohydrates as an excellent platform for catalytic method development is now generating fresh opportunities to advance our understanding of chemical phenomena. Unexpected catalytic mechanisms are often unearthed in such cross&#8208;disciplinary endeavours. Moreover, new bond&#8208;forming catalytic solutions are in great demand as the definition of biologically relevant glycosidic chemical space has broadened substantially beyond native oligosaccharides to include glycomimetics, rare and non&#8208;classical sugars. Distinctly, the last 5 years is marked by an unprecedented flurry of activity in the development of ground&#8208;breaking catalytic carbohydrate transformations, leading to robust methods that diverge from classical glycosylation approaches. In this minireview, lately emerging concepts such as noncovalent catalyzed glycosylations, radical catalyzed glycosylations, asymmetric catalytic carbohydrate functionalizations and new glycosylation modalities will be examined.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Rare Earth&#8208;Confined High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanocrystals for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet&#8208;chemistry synthetic protocol is developed for the creation of rare earth (RE) confined high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA&#8208;RE) nanocrystals (NCs) with rich surface cavities and lattice distortions via a general high&#8208;entropy (HE)&#8208;induced confinement strategy, featuring atomically dispersed RE confined in HE Pt&#8208;based frameworks. These HEA&#8208;RE NCs serve as multi&#8208;synergistic catalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction, demonstrating the multiple proton&#8208; and electron&#8208;coupled complex reactions. 








Abstract
Rare earth (RE) elements with unique lanthanide contraction and electron configuration are promising for many important studies. Alloying RE with typical 3d/5d transition metals generates new or improved properties due to enhanced orbital coupling and thermodynamic stability. However, limited to ultralow reduction potential, strong oxophilicity and poor compatibility of RE, most research focused on high&#8208;temperature procedures and complex processing techniques, which hinders compositional and structural control, functional optimization and mechanistic investigation for diverse applications. Here we define a general wet&#8208;chemistry synthetic protocol for the creation of RE&#8208;confined high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA&#8208;RE) nanocrystals (NCs) under mild conditions, featuring atomically dispersed RE embedded in Pt&#8208;based HEA framework, via sequential reduction kinetics of different metal precursors and high&#8208;entropy effect&#8208;induced confinement of RE atoms. The HEA&#8208;RE NCs with multi&#8208;site synergy switch from boosting simple reaction to complex process involving multiple reactants and intermediates. They achieve &#8764;99% Faradaic efficiency and superior yield rate toward nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction, attributed to carved surface promoting mass transfer, tensile strain tuning adsorbate behavior, and delocalized RE electron regulating reaction pathways. Our study provides a new perspective for rational design and potential application of RE&#8208;based HEA nanostructures with atomic precision.

         <title>Breaking the Linear Scaling Relations for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction with a Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst Composed of a MnFe&#8208;Porphyrrole Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired MnFe porphyrrole aerogel catalyst is synthesized using a covalent 3D framework with adjacent metal centers. The bimetallic structure enhances ORR activity through Mn&#9472;Fe synergy and high active site density. Fuel cell tests show over a 30% increase in peak power density, with DFT calculations confirming metal&#8211;metal charge transfer as the source of improved performance.








Abstract
Bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced catalytic performance through synergistic interactions between the two metals, allowing them to break the linear scaling relations and reach high electrocatalytic activity. This study presents bimetallic aerogel&#8208;based catalyst synthesized as a covalent, three&#8208;dimensional framework containing neighboring iron and manganese sites. The aerogel structure provides a high surface area and porosity, facilitating an ultra&#8208;high active site density and efficient mass transport. The MnFe porphyrrole's unique structure is obtained by alternately linking Mn&#8208;porphyrin and Fe&#8208;corrole complexes. It exhibited outstanding performance with an onset potential of 0.99 VRHE. Comparative studies with a free&#8208;base Fe porphyrrole catalyst (Eonset 0.97 VRHE) revealed that while Mn incorporation led to only a slight improvement in half&#8208;cell performance, it resulted in significantly enhanced performance in anion exchange membrane fuel cell. The MnFe catalyst achieved an OCV of 0.97&#160;V and a peak power density of 0.27&#160;W cm&#8722;2, outperforming the free&#8208;base Fe counterpart. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the higher ORR activity of MnFe&#8208;porphyrrole is due to charge transfer between Mn and Fe atoms, which is absent in the reference free&#8208;base Fe&#8208;porphyrrole. These findings underscore the advantages of bimetallic catalysts in improving ORR activity and fuel cell efficiency by leveraging synergistic effects.

         <title>From Light to Cure: Precision Phototherapies for Antibiotic&#8208;Refractory Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms, formidable barriers to antimicrobial resistance, are prime targets for phototherapies: PTT (local hyperthermia) and PDT (ROS generation). This review examines these approaches and their combinatorial strategies, addressing clinical translation challenges and advancing antibiotic&#8208;independent infection management.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilms serve as formidable barriers in antimicrobial therapy and are central to the emergence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance. Their compact extracellular polymeric matrix, metabolic heterogeneity, and quorum&#8208;sensing&#8211;mediated resistance gene expression collectively endow biofilms with exceptional defense against conventional antibiotics. This review highlights the structural&#8208;functional complexity of biofilms and focuses on emerging phototherapeutic strategies&#8212;photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;as promising biofilm&#8208;targeted approaches. PTT employs near&#8208;infrared light to induce localized hyperthermia, disrupting bacterial membranes and enhancing drug penetration. PDT generates reactive oxygen species via photoactivated photosensitizers, leading to oxidative destruction of both cells and extracellular polymeric substances. These strategies offer metabolic independence, precise spatiotemporal control, and efficacy against dormant pathogens. Recent advances in smart nanoplatforms enable the integration of PTT/PDT with responsive drug delivery, imaging guidance, and immune modulation, achieving multimodal, precision antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, synergistic combinations with enzymatic degradation, immune intervention, and antibiotics show promise in treating chronic and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. We conclude by outlining translational challenges and strategic directions for clinical application, underscoring the potential of phototherapy to reshape infection management beyond antibiotic dependence.

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>
