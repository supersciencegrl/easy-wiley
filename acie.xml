      <title>Molecular Expansion for Constructing Porous Organic Polymers with High Surface Areas and Well&#8208;Defined Nanopores</title>
      <dc:description>Construction of porous organic polymers (POPs) with high surface areas, well&#8208;defined nanopores and excellent stability remains extremely challenging due to unmanageable reaction process. Until now, only a few reported POPs have Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface areas (  S  BET  ) exceeding 3000 m  2  g  &#8211;1  . Herein, we demonstrate a molecular expansion strategy to integrate high surface areas, large nanopore sizes and outstanding stability into POPs. A series of hyper&#8208;crosslinked conjugated polymers (  HCCPs  ) with exceptional porosity are successfully synthesized through this strategy. Specially,  HCCP&#8208;6  and  HCCP&#8208;11  exhibit the highest surface areas (  S  BET  &gt; 3000 m  2  g  &#8211;1  ) and excellent total pore volumes (up to 3.98 cm  3  g  &#8211; 1  ) among these  HCCPs  . They present decent total CH  4  storage capacities of 491 and 421 mg g  &#8211;1  at 80 bar and 298 K, respectively. Meanwhile, they are highly stable in hostile environments. The facile and general molecular expansion strategy would lead to an unprecedented revolution in improving synthetic routes of POPs for desired functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in Fe&#8211;Ni Layered Double Hydroxide Arrays Coupled to Carbon Nanofibers: The Role of Phosphorus Doping</title>
      <dc:description>The key to bringing the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation from conception to application lies in the development of high&#8208;efficiency, cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as hydrotalcites, are promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to multiple metal centers and large surface areas. However, their activities in the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation are unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a simple and effective way of phosphorus doping to regulate the charge distribution in LDHs, thus promoting the nitrogen adsorption and activation. The P&#8208;doped LDHs are further coupled to a self&#8208;supported, conductive matrix, i.e., a carbon nanofibrous membrane, which prevents their aggregation as well as ensures rapid charge transfer at the interface. By this strategy, decent ammonia yield (1.72&#215;10&#8211;10 mol s&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2) and Faradaic efficiency (23%) are delivered at &#8211;0.5 V vs. RHE in 0.1M Na2SO4, which offers a new opportunity of tapping the unknown potentials of the well&#8208;known hydrotalcites (LDHs) in the field of electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Hierarchical FeCoS  2  &#8208;CoS  2  double&#8208;shelled nanotubes have been rationally designed and constructed for efficient photocatalytic CO  2  reduction under visible light. The synthetic strategy, engaging the two&#8208;step cation&#8208;exchange reactions, precisely integrates two metal sulfides into a double&#8208;shelled tubular heterostructure with both of the shells assembled from ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets.

Furthermore, this hybrid structure can expose abundant active sites for enhancing CO  2  adsorption and surface&#8208;dependent redox reactions, and harvest incident solar irradiation more efficiently by light scattering in the complex interior. As a result, these hierarchical FeCoS  2  &#8208;CoS  2  double&#8208;shelled nanotubes exhibit superior activity and high stability for photosensitized deoxygenative CO  2  reduction, affording a high CO&#8208;generating rate of 28.1 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  (per 0.5 mg of catalyst).</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of All&#8208;carbon Disubstituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes by Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Kumada Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are important motifs in drug design as surrogates for p&#8208;substituted arenes and alkynes. Access to all&#8208;carbon disubstituted BCPs via cross coupling has to date been limited to use of the BCP as the organometallic component, which restricts scope due to the harsh conditions typically required for the synthesis of metallated BCPs. Here we report a general method to access 1,3&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted BCPs from 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (iodo&#8208;BCPs) by direct iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and heteroaryl Grignard reagents. This chemistry represents the first general use of iodo&#8208;BCPs as electrophiles in cross&#8208;coupling, and the first Kumada coupling of tertiary iodides. Benefiting from short reaction times, mild conditions, and broad scope of the coupling partners, it enables the synthesis of a wide range of 1,3&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted BCPs including various drug analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Isopeptide&#8208;N&#8208;ethylated deubiquitylase&#8208;resistant ubiquitin probes made through an E1&#8208;catalyzed chemoenzymatic strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Triazole&#8208;based deubiquitylase (DUB)&#8208;resistant ubiquitin (Ub) probes have recently emerged as effective tools for the discovery of Ub&#8208;chain specific interactors in proteomic studies, but their structural diversity is limited. Herein, we report a new family of DUB&#8208;resistant Ub probes based on isopeptide&#8208;N&#8208;ethylated dimeric or polymeric Ub chains, which can be efficiently prepared through a one&#8208;pot, E1&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction of recombinant Ub percursors to give various homotypic and even branched Ub probes at multi&#8208;milligram scale. Proteomic studies using label&#8208;free quantitative mass spectrometry indicated that the isopeptide&#8208;N&#8208;ethylated Ub probes may complement the triazole&#8208;based probes in the study of Ub interactome. Our study highlights the utility of modern protein synthetic chemistry to develop structurally new families of tool molecules needed for proteomic studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of the zwitterionic intermediate in 1,1&#8208;carboboration of alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction of a Lewis acidic borane with an alkyne is a key step in a diverse range of main group transformations. Alkyne 1,1&#8208;carboboration, the Wrackmeyer reaction, is an archetypal transformation of this kind. 1,1&#8208;Carboboration has been proposed to proceed through a zwitterionic intermediate.

      <title>Discovery of a Dual Function Cytochrome P450 that Catalyzes Enyne Formation in Cyclohexanoid Terpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Enynes are an important functionality in organic chemistry. The 1,3&#8208;enyne moiety is commonly found in cyclohexanoid natural products produced by endophytic and plant pathogenic fungi. Asperpentyn (  1  ) is a 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;containing cyclohexanoid terpenoid isolated from  Aspergillus  and  Pestalotiopsis  . The genetic basis and biochemical mechanism of 1,3&#8208;enyne biosynthesis in  1, and other natural products containing this motif, has remained enigmatic despite their potential ecological roles. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster and characterize two crucial enzymes in the biosynthesis of  1. We discovered a P450 monooxygenase that has a dual function to first catalyze dehydrogenation of the prenyl chain to generate a  cis&#8208;diene intermediate and then shows acetylenase activity to yield an alkyne moiety, giving the 1,3&#8208;enyne. We also characterized a UbiA prenyltransferase, which is unusual in that it favors transferring a five&#8208;carbon prenyl chain, rather than a polyprenyl chain, to a  p  &#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid acceptor.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Gating of Ion Transport in Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels with Confined Light&#8208;Responsive Azobenzene Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanochannels modified with responsive molecules have been fabricated to replicate gating functionalities of biological ion channels. But gating effects of the small&#8208;molecular&#8208;modified nanochannels are usually weak mainly because small molecular gates could not efficiently block the large channels at the close states. Herein we report three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) sub&#8208;nanochannels (SNCs) confined with azobenzene (AZO) molecules to achieve efficient light&#8208;gating functionalities. The 3D MOFSNCs consisting of ~9&#8208;12&#8208;&#197;&#8208;sized cavities connected by ~6&#8208;&#197;&#8208;sized triangular windows work as angstrom&#8208;scale ion channels, while confined AZO within the MOF cavities function as light&#8208;driven molecular gates to efficiently regulate the ion flux. The AZO&#8208;MOFSNCs show a good cyclic gating performance and high on&#8208;off ratios up to ~17.8, which is one order of magnitude higher than ratios of ~1.3&#8208;1.5 observed in conventional 1D AZO&#8208;modified nanochannels.

      <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;electron micrography was used to precisely determine the three&#8208;dimensional structure of nanocomposite microgels and to provide insights into the interactions between small hydrophobic molecules and the microgels. As explained by K. Murata, D. Suzuki, et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003493), styrene monomers recognize molecular&#8208;scale differences in polarity within the microgels during emulsion polymerization. This discovery enabled the synthesis of multilayer nanocomposite microgels in one step by free radical seed emulsion polymerization.

      <title>Total Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Amanitin</title>
      <dc:description>
A scalable route to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amanitin: The bicyclic octapeptide is built up by solid&#8208;phase assembly of a linear octamer followed by two consecutive cyclization steps in solution. The key non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, 6&#8208;hydroxytryptophan and (3R,4R)&#8208;dihydroxyisoleucine, are accessible via multistep synthesis on a multigram scale. Amatoxins are important for the development of new payload linkers for antibody&#8211;drug conjugates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amanitin and related amatoxins have been studied for more than six decades mostly by isolation from death cap mushrooms. The total synthesis, however, remained challenging due to unique structural features. &#945;&#8208;Amanitin is a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Interrupting the basic transcription processes of eukaryotes leads to apoptosis of the cell. This unique mechanism makes the toxin an ideal payload for antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). Only microgram quantities of toxins, when delivered selectively to tumor sites through conjugation to antibodies, are sufficient to eliminate malignant tumor cells of almost every origin. By solving the stereoselective access to dihydroxyisoleucine, a photochemical synthesis of the tryptathion precursor, solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, and macrolactamization we obtained a scalable synthetic route towards synthetic &#945;&#8208;amanitin. This makes &#945;&#8208;amanitin and derivatives now accessible for the development of new ADCs.

      <dc:description>
Giant nanocapsules with dimensions of up to 4&#8197;nm and a molecular weight of 57&#8197;kDa were obtained from Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates functionalized with aromatic boronic acids, as reported by Z. Zheng, C. Streb, X. Chen, et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003550). A &#8220;lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; organofunctionalization route was used for the regiospecific attachment of the boronic acids to pre&#8208;functionalized sites within the Dawson anions. This results in the aggregation of closed capsules rather than infinite networks.

      <title>Squalenyl Hydrogen Sulfate Nanoparticles for Simultaneous Delivery of Tobramycin and Alkylquinolone Quorum Sensing Inhibitor to Eradicate P. aeruginosa Biofilm Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Simultaneous delivery of tobramycin and alkylquinolone inhibitors by a self&#8208;assembling nanoparticle system based on squalenyl hydrogen sulfate (SqNPs) is an optimal therapeutic against&#160;P. aeruginosa&#160;biofilm infections. As described by C.&#8208;M. Lehr et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202001407), the drug&#8208;loaded SqNPs show improved biofilm penetration and enhanced efficacy in relevant biological barriers (mucin/human tracheal mucus, biofilm), leading to complete eradication of&#160;P. aeruginosa&#160;biofilms at 16&#8208;fold lower tobramycin concentration than tobramycin alone.

      <title>Structural Elucidation of Selective Solvatochromism in a Responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal Cyclometalated Platinum(II) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
Platinum is king! A responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal platinum(II) emitter undergoes supramolecular and redox transformations on demand, as demonstrated by M.&#8197;J. MacLachlan et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002646). PtII selectively oxidizes into PtIII or PtIV, thus diversifying the structural and photophysical properties of the emitter. Delicate modulation of Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions by solvent molecules results in strong vapo/solvatochromic effects.

Song et&#8197;al. demonstrate a droplet self&#8208;splitting strategy to generate mutually&#8208;independent microdroplets with well&#8208;defined morphology and arrangement, and realize simultaneous multiple detections of complex analytes using one droplet of sample.

      <title>An Activatable Lanthanide Luminescent Probe for Time&#8208;Gated Detection of Nitroreductase in Live Bacteria</title>
      <dc:description>
Illuminating bacterial pathogens by a specific lanthanide luminescent turn&#8208;on probe is demonstrated by H.&#8208;Y. Hu, M. Nazar&#233; et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002391). A non&#8208;fluorescent caged precursor is intracellularly activated by bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) forming a sensitizing, light&#8208;harvesting antenna. Entrapment of the probe inside bacterial cells allows for precise localization of live bacteria by fluorescence lifetime imaging.

Time&#8208;resolved impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, which is an ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman technique, facilitates capturing vibrational snapshots of the excited state molecules with high sensitivity and time resolution. By using this technique, D.

      <title>Luminescence amplification at BiVO4 photoanodes by photoinduced electrochemiluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) combines semiconductor (SC) photoelectrochemistry with electrochemiluminescence (ECL). In PECL, the incident light is converted to a different wavelength by an electrochemical reaction at a SC photoelectrode and allows to trigger ECL at unprecedented low potentials. This concept has been employed so far to design up&#8208;conversion systems using Si or III&#8208;V SCs. Nevertheless, PECL strongly suffers from the photoelectrochemical instability of these low bandgap SCs. Here, we report for the first time an original light conversion strategy based on PECL of a luminol derivative (L&#8208;012) at BiVO  4  photoanodes in water. An incident light photo&#8208;excites simultaneously the L&#8208;012 fluorescence and the photoanode. However, the resulting fluorescence signal is surpassed by the PECL emission. In addition, we show that, with this system, PECL can be induced at a potential as low as &#8208;0.4 V for several hours and that it can be employed to finely tune L&#8208;012 luminescence. This remarkable light enhancement and the record low applied potential are promising for the design of new analytical strategies and light&#8208;addressable systems.</dc:description>

The structures position the C&#8208;2 substituents almost perpendicular to the oligosaccharide main chain axis, pointing to the bulk solvent and available for interactions with antibodies or other binding partners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Temperature&#8208;induced structure reconstruction of support can firmly anchor single&#8208;atom Pt species to adapt high temperature environment.

Experiments reveal that high valence Pt 4+  with more covalent bonds on Mn 2  O 3  are essential for anchoring isolated Pt atoms by strong interaction. Optimized catalyst by moderate H 2  O 2  etching exhibits the best catalytic performance and the excellent thermal stability of single&#8208;atom Pt in high&#8208;temperature CH 4  oxidation on account of more exposed Pt atoms and strong Pt&#8208;Mn 2  O 3  interaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Robust DNA&#8208;bridged memristor for textile chip</title>
      <dc:description>Electronic textiles that are thin, lightweight, flexible and breathable have been widely explored with a variety of functionalities including power supplying, displaying and sensing, which may revolutionize many fields such as communication, health care and artificial intelligence. To date, unfortunately, computing is the missing puzzle to close their functional loop. Memristor is compatible with the interwoven structure and fabricating process in textile due to its two&#8208;terminal and crossbar configuration. However, it remains challenging to realize textile memristors due to the difficulties in designing advanced memristive materials and achieving high&#8208;quality active layers on fiber electrodes. Here we report a robust textile memristor based on an electrophoretic&#8208;deposited active layer of d   eoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) on fiber electrodes. The unique architecture and  orientation of DNA molecules  with the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles offer the best&#8208;in&#8208;class performances, e.g., both  ultra&#8208;  low  operation voltage of ~0.3 V and power consumption of ~100 pW and  high switching speed  of 20 ns. Fundamental logic calculations such as implication and NAND are demonstrated as functions of textile chips,  and it has been thus  integrated with power&#8208;supplying and displaying modules to make  a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept fabric computer  . This work provides a promising route towards wearable computers and artificial neural networks for effective brain&#8208;machine interfaces.</dc:description>

To date, unfortunately, computing is the missing puzzle to close their functional loop. Memristor is compatible with the interwoven structure and fabricating process in textile due to its two&#8208;terminal and crossbar configuration. However, it remains challenging to realize textile memristors due to the difficulties in designing advanced memristive materials and achieving high&#8208;quality active layers on fiber electrodes. Here we report a robust textile memristor based on an electrophoretic&#8208;deposited active layer of d   eoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) on fiber electrodes. The unique architecture and  orientation of DNA molecules  with the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles offer the best&#8208;in&#8208;class performances, e.g., both  ultra&#8208;  low  operation voltage of ~0.3 V and power consumption of ~100 pW and  high switching speed  of 20 ns. Fundamental logic calculations such as implication and NAND are demonstrated as functions of textile chips,  and it has been thus  integrated with power&#8208;supplying and displaying modules to make  a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept fabric computer  . This work provides a promising route towards wearable computers and artificial neural networks for effective brain&#8208;machine interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>High&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by Ni single atom catalysts with tetradentate N2O2 coordination in a three&#8208;phase flow cell</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H 2  O 2  ) is widely used in today&#8217;s chemical industry as an oxidant and bleaching agent, whilst also finding medical utilization as a mild antiseptic. Over the past few years, researchers have targeted the discovery of low cost electrocatalysts which can selectively reduce dioxygen (O 2  ) to H 2  O 2  , with modest success to date. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of carbon&#8208;supported Ni(II) single atom catalysts possessing a tetradentate Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  coordination via a simple &#8220;Schiff base ligand&#8208;mediated&#8221; pyrolysis strategy. Briefly, a Ni(II) complex of the Schiff base ligand (R,R)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;N,N'&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine (Jacobsen&#8217;s ligand) was adsorbed onto a carbon black support, followed by pyrolysis of the modified carbon material at 300 o  C in Ar. The obtained Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  /C catalyst showed excellent performance for the electrocatalytic reduction of O 2  to H 2  O 2  through a two&#8208;electron transfer process in alkaline conditions, with a H 2  O 2  selectivity of 96% realized in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode tests. At a current density of 70 mA cm &#8208;2  , a H 2  O 2  production rate of 5.9 mol g catalyst  &#8208;1  h &#8208;1  was achieved using a three &#8208;  phase flow cell, with good catalyst stability maintained over 8 h of testing. In addition, the Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  /C catalyst could electrocatalytically reduce O 2  in air to H 2  O 2  at a high current density, still affording a high H 2  O 2  selectivity (&gt; 90%). A precise Ni&#8208;N 2  O 2  coordination was key to this impressive performance, guiding the future development of metal single atom catalysts for selective O 2  reduction to H 2  O 2  .</dc:description>

      <title>One&#8208;Step Ring Opening Metathesis Block&#8208;Like Copolymers and their Compositional Analysis by a Novel Retardation Technique</title>
      <dc:description>Using a one&#8208;step synthetic route for block copolymers avoids the repeated addition of monomers to the polymerization mixture, which can easily lead to contamination and, therefore, to the unwanted termination of chain growth. For this purpose, monomers (M1 &#8208; M5) with different steric hindrances and different propagation rates are explored. Copolymerization of M1 (propagating rapidly) with M2 (propagating slowly), M1 with M3 (propagating extremely slowly) and M4 (propagating rapidly) with M5 (propagating slowly) yielded diblock&#8208;like copolymers using Grubbs&#8217; first (G1) or third generation catalyst (G3).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using a one&#8208;step synthetic route for block copolymers avoids the repeated addition of monomers to the polymerization mixture, which can easily lead to contamination and, therefore, to the unwanted termination of chain growth. For this purpose, monomers (M1 &#8208; M5) with different steric hindrances and different propagation rates are explored. Copolymerization of M1 (propagating rapidly) with M2 (propagating slowly), M1 with M3 (propagating extremely slowly) and M4 (propagating rapidly) with M5 (propagating slowly) yielded diblock&#8208;like copolymers using Grubbs&#8217; first (G1) or third generation catalyst (G3). The monomer consumption was followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which revealed vastly different reactivity ratios for M1 and M2. In the case of M1 and M3, we observed the highest difference in reactivity ratios (r1=324 and r2=0.003) ever reported for a copolymerization method.

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy in divalent lanthanide compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Complexes of trivalent lanthanides are well known to possess strong magnetic anisotropy which enables them to be efficient single&#8208;molecule magnets. We report here high&#8208;level ab initio calculations for [LnO], Ln=Tb, Dy, Ho, which show that divalent lanthanides can exhibit equally strong magnetic anisotropy and magnetization blocking barriers.

      <title>Single&#8208;crystalline Optical Microcavities from Luminescent Dendrimers</title>
      <dc:description>Microcrystallites are promising minute mirrorless laser sources. A variety of luminescent organic compounds have been exploited along this line, but dendrimers have been inapplicable due to their fragility and extremely poor crystallinity. Here we show a novel dendrimer family that overcomes these difficulties.

The COPV2 cores align uni/bidirectionally in the crystals while the Cz units in  G2  &#8208; and  G3COPV2  align omnidirectionally. The dendrons work as light&#8208;harvesting antennas that absorb non&#8208;polarized light and transfer it to the COPV2 core, from which a polarized luminescence radiates. Furthermore, these crystals act as laser resonators, where the lasing thresholds are strongly coupled with the crystal morphology and the orientation of COPV2, which is in contrast with the conventional amorphous dendrimers.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible dehalogenation in on&#8208;surface aryl&#8208;aryl coupling</title>
      <dc:description>In the emerging field of on&#8208;surface synthesis, dehalogenative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling is unarguably the most prominent tool for the fabrication of covalently bonded carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials. Despite its importance, the reaction kinetics are still poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive temperature&#8208;programmed x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigation of reaction kinetics and energetics in the prototypical on&#8208;surface dehalogenative polymerization of 4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl into poly(para&#8208;phenylene) on two coinage metal surfaces, Cu(111) and Au(111). We find clear evidence for reversible dehalogenation on Au(111), which is inhibited on Cu(111) owing to the formation of organometallic intermediates. The incorporation of reversible dehalogenation in the reaction rate equations leads to excellent agreement with experimental data and allows extracting the relevant energy barriers. Our findings deepen the mechanistic understanding and call for its reassessment for surface&#8208;confined aryl&#8208;aryl coupling on the most frequently used metal substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of a novel Mycobacterial F&#8208;ATP synthase inhibitor and its potency in combination with diarylquinolines</title>
      <dc:description>The F  1  F  O  &#8208;ATP synthase is required for growth and viability of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  . Bedaquiline validated this target clinically. We showed recently that a mycobacterium&#8208;specific loop of the enzyme&#8217;s rotary &#947; subunit plays a role in coupling of ATP synthesis within the enzyme complex. Here, we report the discovery of a novel antimycobacterial, termed GaMF1, targeting this &#947; subunit loop. Biochemical and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies show that GaMF1 inhibits ATP synthase activity by binding to the loop. GaMF1 is bactericidal and is active against multidrug&#8208; as well as Bedaquiline&#8208;resistant strains. Chemistry efforts on the scaffold revealed a dynamic structure activity relationship and delivered analogues with nanomolar potencies. Combining GaMF1 with bedaquiline or novel diarylquinoline analogues showed potentiation without inducing genotoxicity or phenotypic changes in a human embryonic stem cell reporter assay. These results suggest that GaMF1 presents an attractive lead for the discovery of a novel class of anti&#8208;tuberculosis F&#8208;ATP synthase inhibitors.</dc:description>

Combining GaMF1 with bedaquiline or novel diarylquinoline analogues showed potentiation without inducing genotoxicity or phenotypic changes in a human embryonic stem cell reporter assay. These results suggest that GaMF1 presents an attractive lead for the discovery of a novel class of anti&#8208;tuberculosis F&#8208;ATP synthase inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Interplay between Lead Vacancy and Water Rationalizes the Puzzle of Charge Carrier Lifetimes in CH3NH3PbI3: Time&#8208;Domain Ab Initio Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>The perovskite excited&#8208;state lifetimes exhibit the conflicting experimental results exposure to humidity, which should correlate with defects because they inevitably present in perovskite films. Nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the formation energy of a lead vacancy decreases from 0.29 eV in pristine MAPbI  3  (MA= CH  3  NH  3  +  ) to over &#8208;2 eV in the perovskite in the presence water regardless of its oxidation states, indicating that the lead vacancy is a major defect and which can spontaneously form in the moist environment. The lead vacancy reduces NA coupling by localizing hole for decreasing the overlap with electron, slowing electron&#8208;hole recombination by a factor of 2. By creating a deep electron trap state due to formation of an iodine dimer in presence of the lead vacancy interacting strongly with water molecules, the electron gets rapidly trapped on 4 ps and then recombines with the valence band free hole within sub&#8208;1 ns. The over 3 times acceleration relative to the pristine system is owing to enhanced NA couplings. By eliminating the  mid&#8208;gap state due to dissociation of the iodine dimer with accepting two photoexcited electrons,  the electron&#8208;hole recombination reduces by a factor of over 2 compared to the pristine MAPbI  3  , arising due to the reduced overlap between electron and hole. The calculated recombination time scales show excellent agreement with experiment. These phenomena arise due to a complex interplay of the unusual chemical, structural, electrostatic and quantum properties of halide perovskites. The simulations rationalize the positive and negative effects of water on the solar cell performance exposure to humidity. The detailed mechanistic understanding of the complex charge&#8208;phonon dynamics of perovskite in the presence of defects and water molecules provides key insights for a broad range of solar and electro&#8208;optic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Predictable selectivity in remote C&#8208;H Oxidation of steroids via analysis of substrate binding mode</title>
      <dc:description>Predictability is a key requirement to encompass late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization in synthetic routes. However, prediction (and control) of reaction selectivity is usually challenging, especially for complex substrate structures and elusive transformations such as remote C(  sp  3  )&#8208;H oxidation, as it requires to distinguish a specific C&#8208;H bond from many others with similar reactivity. Herein, we develop a strategy for predictable, remote C&#8208;H oxidation that entails substrate binding to a supramolecular Mn or Fe catalyst followed by elucidation of the conformation of the host&#8208;guest adduct via NMR analysis or, more easily, docking of crystal structures. These analyses indicate which remote C&#8208;H bonds are suitably oriented for the oxidation before carrying out the reaction, enabling prediction of site&#8208;selectivity. We applied this strategy to late&#8208;stage C(  sp  3  )&#8208;H oxidation of aminosteroids at C15 (or C16) positions, with a selectivity tunable by modification of catalyst chirality and metal.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) lead&#8208;free perovskites have unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Here, we report undoped and Sb&#8208;doped all inorganic, lead&#8208;free, 0D perovskite single crystals A  2  InCl  5  (H  2  O) (A = Rb, Cs), which exhibit greatly enhanced yellow emission.

The photoluminescence (PL) color changes from yellow to green emission. Interestingly, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) realizes a great boost from &lt; 2% to 85&#8208;95% through doping Sb  3+  . We further explore the effect of Sb  3+  dopants and the origin of bright emission by ultrafast transient absorption techniques. In addition, undoped and Sb&#8208;doped 0D rubidium indium chloride perovskites show excellent stability. These findings not only provide a way to design a set of new high&#8208;performance 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites, but also reveal the relationship between structure and PL properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethane through Stabilization of an Ethoxy Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethane is seldom observed because of the generally higher selectivity towards methane, ethylene, and ethanol. Consequently, little experimental evidence for its reaction mechanism exists and thus remains largely unknown. Here, by combining electrochemistry with in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and in&#8208;situ Raman techniques, we study iodide&#8208;derived copper (ID&#8208;Cu) and oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) systems to obtain a deeper understanding of the CO2 to ethane mechanism. With trace iodine species on the surface and positively charged Cu species, production of ethane is significantly more favored on ID&#8208;Cu compared to OD&#8208;Cu, with higher selectivity and faster kinetics. For the first time, it is experimentally found that the formation of ethane follows the same pathway to ethylene and ethanol, and better stabilization of the late stage ethoxy intermediate can steer the reaction to ethane over ethanol.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient chemical protein synthesis using Fmoc&#8208;masked N&#8208;terminal cysteine in Cys&#8208;peptide thioesters</title>
      <dc:description>We report here an operationally very simple method to greatly facilitate chemical protein synthesis by fully convergent and one&#8208;pot native chemical ligations utilizing the Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) moiety as an N&#8208;masking group of the N&#8208;terminal cysteine of the middle peptide thioester segment(s). The Fmoc group is stable to harsh oxidative conditions frequently used to generate peptide thioester from hydrazide or o&#8208;aminoanilide. The ready availability of the Fmoc&#8208;Cys(Trt)&#8208;OH, routinely used in Fmoc chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis, where the Fmoc group is pre&#8208;installed on cysteine residue, minimizes additional steps required for the temporary protection of the N&#8208;terminal cysteinyl peptides. The Fmoc group is readily removed after ligation reaction by short exposure (&lt;7 min) to 20% piperidine at pH 11 in aqueous condition at room temperature. Subsequent native chemical ligation reactions can be performed in presence of piperidine in the same solution at pH 7.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report here an operationally very simple method to greatly facilitate chemical protein synthesis by fully convergent and one&#8208;pot native chemical ligations utilizing the Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) moiety as an N&#8208;masking group of the N&#8208;terminal cysteine of the middle peptide thioester segment(s). The Fmoc group is stable to harsh oxidative conditions frequently used to generate peptide thioester from hydrazide or o&#8208;aminoanilide. The ready availability of the Fmoc&#8208;Cys(Trt)&#8208;OH, routinely used in Fmoc chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis, where the Fmoc group is pre&#8208;installed on cysteine residue, minimizes additional steps required for the temporary protection of the N&#8208;terminal cysteinyl peptides. The Fmoc group is readily removed after ligation reaction by short exposure (&amp;lt;7 min) to 20% piperidine at pH 11 in aqueous condition at room temperature. Subsequent native chemical ligation reactions can be performed in presence of piperidine in the same solution at pH 7.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Unveiling the Local Structure of Palladium Loaded into Imine&#8208;Linked Layered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Cross&#8208;Coupling Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Layered covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs), composed of reversible imine&#8208;linkages and accessible pores, offer a versatile platform for chemical modifications towards the development of catalytic materials. Notably, nitrogen&#8208;enriched COF materials have been proved as good candidates for binding palladium species. Understanding the local structure of reacting palladium sites bonded to the COF pores is key to rationalize interactions between active sites and porous surfaces. By combining advanced synchrotron characterization tools, such as Pair Distribution Function analyses and X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy, with periodic computational Density Functional Theory modeling, we resolve the precise atomic structure of catalytic palladium sites attached to local&#8208;defects within an archetypical imine&#8208;linked 2D&#8208;COF. This material has been synthesized using an  in&#8208;situ  method as a gel, under which imine&#8208;hydrolysis and metalation reactions are coupled. We demonstrate that  in&#8208;situ  formed local defects within imine&#8208;linked 2D&#8208;COF materials are highly reactive towards palladium metalation, resulting in active materials for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>meta&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Arylation of Fluoroarenes and Simple Arenes</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorine is known to promote ortho&#8208; C&#8722;H metalation.  1  Based upon this reactivity, we employed an activated norbornene to trap the ortho&#8208;palladation intermediate and relay to the meta&#8208;position, leading to a meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of fluoroarenes. Deuterium experiment suggests that this meta&#8208;arylation is initiated by ortho C&#8722;H activation and the catalytic cycle is terminated by the C&#8208;2 protonation. The dual ligand system is crucial for the observed high reactivty and site&#8208;selectivity.

      <title>Nanocrystals Assembled by Chemical Reaction of Dispersion Solvent</title>

In this study, we demonstrate a unique class of bottom&#8208;up approaches to assemble nanocrystals into patterns. Our approach for patterning nanocrystals focuses on the utilization and control of the chemical reaction of solvents surrounding nanocrystals. The photopolymerization of solvent molecules through a photomask creates time&#8208;dependent concentration gradients of the solvents.

The AgNW&#8208;embedded film properties are determined by the organized AgNW structures and include light transmission and electrical conductivity. Overall, the demonstrated method is very simple, widely applicable to various nanocrystals and solvents, and can thus contribute to the development of a new class of nanocrystal patterning methods.</dc:description>

Although the integration of plasticity and elasticity on a crystal is theoretically possible and it benefits the rich and complex deformations which are highly demanded for applications, the integration is hard to be realized practically.

      <title>Metal&#8208;like Ductility in Organic Plastic Crystals: Role of Molecular Shape and Dihydrogen Bonding Interactions in Aminoboranes
</title>
      <dc:description>
Slip slidin&#8217; away: Aminoborane crystals can be deformed mechanically while retaining high crystallinity because multiple slip planes exist in their high&#8208;symmetry structures. The presence of dihydrogen bonds in a similar semiglobular system, BH3NHMe2, negates ductility. Mechanically castable plastic crystals are appealing for applications such as ferroelectrics and soft robotics.







Abstract
Ductility is a common phenomenon in many metals but is difficult to achieve in molecular crystals. Organic crystals bend plastically on one or two face&#8208;specific directions but fracture when stressed in any other arbitrary directions. An exceptional metal&#8208;like ductility and malleability in the isomorphous crystals of two globular molecules, BH3NMe3 and BF3NMe3, is reported, with characteristic tensile stretching, compression, twisting, and thinning. The mechanically deformed samples, which transition to lower symmetry phases, retain good long&#8208;range order amenable to structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Molecules in these high&#8208;symmetry crystals interact through electrostatic forces (B&#8722;&#8722;N+) to form columnar structures with multiple slip planes and weak dispersive forces between columns. On the other hand, the limited number of facile slip planes and strong dihydrogen bonding in BH3NHMe2 negates ductility. Our study has implications for the design of soft ferroelectrics, solid electrolytes, barocalorics, and soft robotics.

Molecules in these high&#8208;symmetry crystals interact through electrostatic forces (B&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to form columnar structures with multiple slip planes and weak dispersive forces between columns. On the other hand, the limited number of facile slip planes and strong dihydrogen bonding in BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NHMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; negates ductility. Our study has implications for the design of soft ferroelectrics, solid electrolytes, barocalorics, and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of electrochemical transformations in asymmetric synthesis is described in this Minireview. Three major types of catalytic enantioselective strategies in electrosynthesis, including electrochemical activation of chiral catalyst&#8208;bound substrates, asymmetric cascade electrochemical processes, and chemically modified chiral electrodes, are discussed.







Abstract
The field of electrochemical synthesis has developed rapidly over the last decade and has provided alternative synthetic methods with the absence of stoichiometric amounts of chemical oxidants or reductants. Although sustainable electrosynthetic procedures have been developed, relatively few examples of highly enantioselective catalytic electrosynthesis have been reported to date. The development of general strategies for electrochemical enantiocontrol has thus proven to be a considerable challenge. This Minireview highlights the current knowledge and recent advances in the synthetic utility of electrochemical transformations for asymmetric synthesis. Specifically, three major types of catalytic enantioselective strategy in electrosynthesis are outlined, including electrochemical activation of chiral catalyst&#8208;bound substrates, asymmetric cascade electrochemical processes, and chemically modified chiral electrodes.

Chemical intuition tells us that pressure increases ordering in most known materials. The discovery of pressure&#8208;induced disorder in double perovskites Y2CoIrO6 and Y2CoRuO6 is in contrast to traditional theories of order&#8211;disorder mechanisms and calls for to reconsideration of pressure effects in solid state sciences.

      <title>Radical Chemistry and Reaction Mechanisms of Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation over Hexagonal Boron Nitride Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride is an emerging catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to produce olefins with high selectivity and activity. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002440), V. Fung, W. Huang, Z. Wu, and co&#8208;workers report the first direct experimental evidence of gas&#8208;phase methyl radicals (CH3&#8901;) in propane ODH over boron&#8208;based catalysts. The presence of gas&#8208;phase radicals is shown to be partially responsible for the generation of cracking products (C2 and C1) in propane ODH.

      <title>Prospect of Sulfurized Pyrolyzed Poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention S@pPAN: As the representative of molecular scale sulfur composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) has attracted great attention owing to its superior electrochemical behavior. It avoids polysulfides dissolving and provides an alternative solid&#8211;solid conversion (SSC) process. Several research directions are proposed to build better batteries based on the promising S@pPAN composite.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are one of the most promising next&#8208;generation batteries owing to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density and that sulfur is an abundant resource. During the past 20&#8197;years, various sulfur materials have been reported. As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.

As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular Springs: Integration of Complex Dynamic Architectures into Functional Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Spring fever: Supramolecular springs are defined as helical molecules or assemblies thereof in which the pitch can be modulated by external stimuli to achieve full control over the extension&#8211;contraction motion. In this Minireview, the structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and spring&#8208;like materials triggered by external stimuli are highlighted for potential future applications in responsive macroscopic devices.







Abstract
Molecular/supramolecular springs are artificial nanoscale objects possessing well&#8208;defined structures and tunable physicochemical properties. Like a macroscopic spring, supramolecular springs are capable of switching their nanoscale conformation as a response to external stimuli by undergoing mechanical spring&#8208;like motions. This dynamic action offers intriguing opportunities for engineering molecular nanomachines by translating the stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoscopic motions into macroscopic work. These nanoscopic objects are reversible dynamic multifunctional architectures which can express a variety of novel properties and behave as adaptive nanoscopic systems. In this Minireview, we focus on the design and structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and their (self&#8208;)assembly as a prerequisite towards the generation of novel dynamic materials featuring controlled movements to be readily integrated into macroscopic devices for applications in sensing, robotics, and the internet of things.

      <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Nonheme Iron Oxidation Catalysis: Involvement of Oxoiron(V) Oxidants in Cleaving Strong C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of bio&#8208;inspired catalytic nonheme iron systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. This Review highlights recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the pathways that can be accessed by these systems to form high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.







Abstract
Nonheme iron enzymes generate powerful and versatile oxidants that perform a wide range of oxidation reactions, including the functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds, which is a major challenge for chemists. The oxidative abilities of these enzymes have inspired bioinorganic chemists to design synthetic models to mimic their ability to perform some of the most difficult oxidation reactions and study the mechanisms of such transformations. Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of these bio&#8208;inspired catalytic systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. In this Review, we highlight the recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the various pathways that can be accessed by bio&#8208;inspired nonheme iron systems to form the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.
