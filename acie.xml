         <title>Organic Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery: Planar, &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Quinone&#8208;Based Polymer Endows Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy as promising cathode material in organic zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), FTIR and XPS characterizations verify a reversible Zn2+&#8208;coordination mechanism in our PPPA cathode. Intriguingly, an ultrahigh Zn2+ diffusion coefficient of 1.2&#215;10&#8208;7 cm2 s&#8208;1 was found in this large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which is the highest one among all organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations reveal the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in our PPPA sample results in a significant reduction on energy gap, effectively accelerating intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process. Our finding provides insights to achieve high zinc&#8208;ion transport kinetics by a design strategy on planar polymer system.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Mechanochemistry for the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;Type Coupling of Aryl Sulfamates via Ball Milling and Twin&#8208;Screw Extrusion.

The nickel catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling of aryl sulfamates and boronic acid derivatives enabled by temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry via the development of a programmable PID&#8208;controlled jar heater is reported. This base&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free, all&#8208;under&#8208;air protocol was also scaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion technology affording decagram quantities of material.







Abstract
The use of temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry to enable the mechanochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling is herein described. Transitioning from a capricious room&#8208;temperature protocol, through to a heated, PID&#8208;controlled programmable jar heater manifold was required to deliver an efficient method for the coupling of aryl sulfamates (derived from ubiquitous phenols) and aryl boronic acid species. Furthermore, this process is conducted using a base&#8208;metal nickel catalyst, in the absence of bulk solvent, and in the absence of air/moisture sensitive reaction set&#8208;ups. This methodology is showcased through translation to large&#8208;scale twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodology enabling 200&#8208;fold scale increase, producing decagram quantities of C&#8722;C coupled material.

         <title>Dynamic AIE crosslinks in liquid crystal networks: visualizing for actuation&#8208;guiding, re&#8208;bonding for actuation&#8208;altering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel covalent adaptable liquid crystal network (CALCN) actuators crosslinked by dynamic AIE luminogens were built based on Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one material design &#8220;visualizes&#8221;, through fluorescing, the crosslinking state and actuation capability for actuation&#8208;guiding in CALCN, while enabling network &#8220;re&#8208;bonding&#8221; through associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms for unprecedented actuation&#8208;reprogrammability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable liquid crystal networks (CALCNs) are highly potential actuating materials due to their actuation properties and shape reprogrammability. Given the importance of network crosslinking state in a CALCN actuator, we sought an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to probe and visualize its dynamic network while ensuring actuation and reprogramming. Here, tetraphenylethylene derivatives were incorporated into liquid crystal networks via the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction, acting simultaneously as reversible crosslinkers and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probes. The thermally tunable fluorescence of the resulting network can correlate to and thus visualize the actuator's crosslinking status, actuation capability and temperature in real&#8208;time and in situ, yielding an intriguing actuation limit&#8208;alerting function. Furthermore, we verified unprecedented reprogrammability of the AIE&#8208;type CALCNs through both associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms of DA chemistry.

         <title>Facile Route to Novel Diazaphosphinine&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of diazaphosphinine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (DP&#8208;PAHs) is reported. The electronic structures and optoelectronic properties are highly tunable via the rich phosphorus chemistry. With balanced S1 and T1 emission, DP&#8208;PAH with P=S center exhibits a single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emitting character in the crystalline state.







Abstract
Doping main&#8208;group elements has become a unique strategy to fine&#8208;tune optoelectronic properties of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Herein, we report the first example of diazaphosphinine based polycyclic hydrocarbons (DP&#8208;PAHs) via facile synthetic protocols. Synthesis of diazaphosphinine heterocycles harnesses mild and efficient P&#8722;N chemistry. The heterocycles readily undergo photocyclizations by using only oxidants. The photocyclization protocol is applicable to the heterocycles with various P&#8208;centers. We successfully extended the protocols in extended DP&#8208;PAHs with 13&#8208;fused aromatic rings. Further adjusting P&#8208;chemistry allows to efficiently fine&#8208;tune the singlet and triplet emission characteristics. More importantly, single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting character was achieved via the balanced singlet and triplet emission of DP&#8208;PAH. Therefore, this work opens up new horizons in the area of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials.

         <title>Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In neutral aqueous solution, a single&#8208;atom nanozyme Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic active sites exhibited ultra&#8208;high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and durability of 100&#8197;h for electroreduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO2, while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. Here we report a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeded 97&#8201;% over &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. The current density at &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE reached a maximum of 1.23&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (turnover frequency of 69.7&#8197;s&#8722;1) with an FE of 99.6&#8201;%. No obvious degradation was observed over 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N4 site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N5 site has an increase and a decrease in the 
 and dxz/yz orbital energy levels, respectively, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N5 catalytic site is more superior to activate CO2 molecule and reduce the energy barriers as well as promote the CO desorption, thus boosting the kinetic activation process and catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;In neutral aqueous solution, a single-atom nanozyme &lt;b&gt;Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;/b&gt; with enzyme-like catalytic active sites exhibited ultra-high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and durability of 100&#8197;h for electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. Here we report a single-atom nanozyme (&lt;b&gt;Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;/b&gt;) that achieves industrial-scale performance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeded 97&#8201;% over &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. The current density at &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. RHE reached a maximum of 1.23&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (turnover frequency of 69.7&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with an FE of 99.6&#8201;%. No obvious degradation was observed over 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site, the square-pyramidal Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; site has an increase and a decrease in the 
 and d&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;xz&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;yz&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; orbital energy levels, respectively, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; catalytic site is more superior to activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and reduce the energy barriers as well as promote the CO desorption, thus boosting the kinetic activation process and catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tracking Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury in Real Time with a Reversible NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescent Redox Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible fluorescent redox probe with emission beyond 1500&#8197;nm was synthesized to dynamically monitor the time&#8208;resolved reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluctuations during hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) in vivo. The strategy not only circumvents the difficulty in building reversible fluorescent probes in the NIR&#8208;II region but also offers a useful tool for early diagnosis and timely treatment of HIRI.







Abstract
Hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) is responsible for liver dysfunction, which involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the most critical marker. Real&#8208;time monitoring of ROS during HIRI can provide significant chance for early diagnosis and timely intervention. However, there is no probe available to track ROS fluctuations during HIRI in vivo, as it is extremely challenging to design reversibly responsive fluorescent probe in near&#8208;infrared region. Here, a reversible redox probe REPOMs emitting beyond 1500&#8197;nm is proposed to fill the blank, using rare earth ions&#8208;doped nanoparticles as emitter, and molybdenum&#8208;based polyoxometalate nanoclusters as the ROS&#8208;recognition site and emission modulator. REPOMs exhibited excellent response towards the repeated cycle between ROS and glutathione, based on which the time&#8208;resolved ROS changes during HIRI were successfully obtained. This reversible probe may provide a powerful tool to promote the hepatology research in the future.

         <title>Multistate Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching through Stimuli&#8208;Induced Co&#8208;Conformation Regulations of Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using topologically chiral [2]catenanes as not only the chiral platform but also the switching scaffold, the first construction of a novel bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence switching system was successfully realized.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum), topologically chiral [2]catenanes were employed as the key platform to construct a novel multistate CPL switching system. Taking advantage of the precise co&#8208;conformation regulations of the resultant pyrene&#8208;functionalized [2]catenanes under different external stimuli, reversible transformations between three emission states with different CPL performances, i.e. the initial &#8220;closed&#8221; form with a |glum| value of 0.012, the &#8220;open&#8221; form with an almost complete turn&#8208;off of CPL emission, and the &#8220;protonated&#8221; form with a boosted |glum| value of 0.022, were successfully realized. This study demonstrates the successful construction of not only the first topological chirality&#8208;based CPL switch, but also a novel bidirectional CPL switch, thus providing a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

We combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent bonds to form a Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure piezo&#8208;photocatalyst with tunable shell thickness for overall water splitting. The optimal sample reveals the unprecedented H2 and O2 production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is an ideal way to generate renewable energy while still challenging. For the first time, this work combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent linkages to form Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure for overall water splitting. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the polarized electric field and photo&#8208;generated charges, as well as the precise adjustment of shell thickness, the carrier separation and utilization efficiency is greatly improved. The optimal BiFeO3@TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF photocatalyst revealed hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with light irradiation, which is the best performance among various piezo&#8208; and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This provides a new sight for the practical application of highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Generation of Tunable Ultrastrong White&#8208;Light Emission by Activation of a Solid Supramolecule through Bromonaphthylpyridinium Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid supramolecule based on a sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and diarylethene derivative has been developed by a bromonaphthylpyridinium polymerization strategy. The supramolecule exhibits tunable phosphorescence emission in the amorphous state and can be applied for stimuli&#8208;responsive data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Herein, we reported solid supramolecular bromonaphthylpyridinium polymers (P&#8208;BrNp), which exhibit tunable phosphorescence emission in the amorphous state enabled by sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) and diarylethene derivatives. The monomer BrNp gave single fluorescence emission at 490&#8197;nm, while an apparent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) at 550&#8197;nm emerged for P&#8208;BrNp copolymers with various feed ratios. Through fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence dual emission, P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 displayed an ultrahigh white&#8208;light emission quantum yield of 83.9&#8201;%. Moreover, the subsequent assembly with SBE&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD further enhanced the phosphorescent quantum yield of P&#8208;BrNp&#8208;0.1 from 64.1&#8201;% to 71.3&#8201;%, accompanied by the conversion of photoluminescence emission from white to yellow. Diarylethene monomers were introduced as photoswitches to realize reversible RTP emission, which can be used in switchable data encryption and multifunctional writing ink.

         <title>The Microscopic Origin of Second Harmonic Generation Response: The Spatial Structure of Instantaneous Dipole Moments in Electron Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the NLO materials reported herein, an electron transits from the oxygen atom of the valence state to the barium atom of the conduction state caused by the optical excitation. The charge transition generates instantaneous spatial dipole moments, which contribute to the projected SHG. Depending on the arrangement and ambience of the dipole moments, all microscopic SHG integrate into the macroscopic SHG response.







Abstract
A deep understanding on the crucial factors of the enhanced macroscopic second harmonic generation (SHG) in some deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is needed to design new NLO materials. Since an optical process relates to the electron excitation and polarization simultaneously, the instantaneous dipole moments and their structures in excitation should be seriously taken account to seek the principal factor in SHG response. In this work, we study the Ba4B11O20F (BBOF), a NLO material, by using the orbital projection technique. From the projected SHG of our theoretic calculation, we recognize the principal dipole moment of the dominant influence on SHG and the relevant atom groups between which the dipole moment is accommodated. With the conclusion that the dipole moment with the most significant influence on SHG is the one between the oxygen&#8211;boron polyhedral anion group and barium cation, we predict that Ba4Al11O20F (BAOF) has a comparable SHG response.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Hydrophilicity and Stability of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification for Water Vapor Sorption/Desorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with large pores often lack sufficient hydrophilicity and stability. A post&#8208;synthetic modification of MOF&#8208;808 with di&#8208;sulfonic acids simultaneously enhances its hydrophilicity and stability while maintaining the high water&#8208;sorption capacity, achieving high swing capacities practical for potential applications, such as water harvesting and adsorptive heat transformations.







Abstract
With increasing demands for high&#8208;performance water sorption materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained considerable attention due to their high maximum uptake capacities. In many cases, however, high overall capacity is not necessarily accomplishing high working capacity under operating conditions, due to insufficient hydrophilicity and/or water stability. Herein, we present a post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of MOF&#8208;808, with di&#8208;sulfonic acids enhancing simultaneously its hydrophilicity and water stability without sacrificing its uptake capacity of &#8776;30&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM enabled a shift of the relative humidity (RH) associated with a sharp step in water vapor sorption from 35&#8211;40&#8201;% RH in MOF&#8208;808 to below 25&#8201;% RH. While MOF&#8208;808 lost uptake capacity and crystallinity over multiple sorption/desorption cycles, the di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM MOF&#8208;808 retained &gt;80&#8201;% of the original capacity. PSM MOF&#8208;808 exhibited good hydrothermal stability up to 60&#8201;&#176;C and high swing capacity.

         <title>Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenyl Imide with Mono&#8208; or Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allenyl imide and alkenes was achieved by utilizing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;magnesium(II) complex as the catalyst. This protocol provided a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A stepwise mechanism was proposed based on experimental studies and DFT calculations and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction was crucial for the enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition of allenyl imide and mono&#8208; or disubstituted alkenes is disclosed. The key feature of this method is the use of bidentate allenyl imide and weakly activated and less steric hindered alkene pair by utilizing chiral magnesium(II) complex of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide, which could provide through&#8208;space dispersion interactions to orientate the arrangement of the alkene. This protocol allows the generation of a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes and four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing spirocycles (80 examples) in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active molecules as well. Experimental studies and DFT calculations revealed that this [2+2] cycloaddition proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving a short&#8208;lived zwitterionic intermediate. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the alkenes and the amide moiety in the ligand was crucial for the enantiocontrol.

         <title>Origins of p&#8208;Doping and Nonradiative Recombination in CsSnI3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn vacancies have long been thought to be the key defects inducing high p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping in Sn&#8208;based perovskites, such as CsSnI3. However, by performing rigorous first&#8208;principles calculations, it is revealed that the defects dominating p&#8208;doping are Cs vacancies instead of Sn vacancies.







Abstract
It is commonly believed that the spontaneous p&#8208;doping in Sn&#8208;based perovskites is caused by Sn vacancies. By performing rigorous first&#8208;principles calculations for a prototypical Sn&#8208;based perovskite CsSnI3, we reveal that, in fact, the defects dominating p&#8208;doping are Cs vacancies. The reason that adding extra Sn2+ could reduce p&#8208;doping is that Cs and Sn present the same changing trend in terms of chemical potentials, and thus inhibiting the formation of Sn vacancies will also limit the formation of Cs vacancies. Moreover, we show that I vacancies are the dominant nonradiative recombination centers, and can result in sizable nonradiative losses, which explains why the experimentally measured carrier lifetime is only a few nanoseconds even if p&#8208;doping is suppressed. This work provides new insights into the origins of p&#8208;doping and nonradiative recombination in CsSnI3, and suggests that minimizing the formation of Cs and I vacancies is critical to realizing the best device performance.

         <title>A Bifunctional CdS/MoO2/MoS2 Catalyst Enhances Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and Pyruvic Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated electrons and holes in CdS hollow spheres loaded with MoS2 and MoO2 dual cocatalysts are applied to hydrogen evolution and selective pyruvic acid production, respectively. This bifunctional strategy can fully utilize the redox abilities of photogenerated electrons and holes to enhance photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The best use of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial to boosting photocatalytic activity. Herein, a bifunctional dual&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;modified photocatalyst is constructed based on CdS/MoO2/MoS2 hollow spheres for hydrogen evolution coupled with selective pyruvic acid (PA) production from lactic acid (LA) oxidation. MoS2 and MoO2 are simultaneously obtained from the conversion of CdMoO4 in one step. In a photocatalytic process, the MoS2 and MoO2 function as the reduction and oxidation centers on which photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate and are used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PA synthesis, respectively. By monitoring the intermediates, a two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron route for PA production is proposed, initiated by the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the LA. The conversion of LA and the selectivity of PA can reach ca. 29&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% after a five&#8208;hour reaction, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Photogenerated electrons and holes in CdS hollow spheres loaded with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual cocatalysts are applied to hydrogen evolution and selective pyruvic acid production, respectively. This bifunctional strategy can fully utilize the redox abilities of photogenerated electrons and holes to enhance photocatalytic activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best use of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial to boosting photocatalytic activity. Herein, a bifunctional dual-cocatalyst-modified photocatalyst is constructed based on CdS/MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hollow spheres for hydrogen evolution coupled with selective pyruvic acid (PA) production from lactic acid (LA) oxidation. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are simultaneously obtained from the conversion of CdMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in one step. In a photocatalytic process, the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; function as the reduction and oxidation centers on which photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate and are used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PA synthesis, respectively. By monitoring the intermediates, a two-step single-electron route for PA production is proposed, initiated by the cleavage of the &#945;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond in the LA. The conversion of LA and the selectivity of PA can reach &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 29&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% after a five-hour reaction, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Trap Engineering toward Remarkable Crystallographic Reorientation and Efficient Cation Migration of Zn Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special design of anion&#8208;trap additive can greatly enhance the stability and capacity of the Zn ion batteries via modulating preferred Zn crystal plane and enabling fast Zn ion migration.







Abstract
Zn batteries are considered as potential candidates in future power sources, however suffer problems of rampant dendrite/by&#8208;product on Zn anodes, torpid Zn2+ transfer/diffusion and poor energy density. Inspired by the host&#8208;guest interaction chemistry, an anion&#8208;trap agent &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) is introduced into the Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte to induce dominant Zn (002) deposition and improve Zn2+ migration behaviors. The anion ClO4&#8722; is revealed to be trapped inside the cavity of &#946;&#8208;CD, impairing barriers for Zn2+ migration and significantly elevating the Zn2+ transference number to 0.878. Meanwhile, the &#946;&#8208;CD@ClO4&#8722; complex shows the function in preferential growth of the Zn (002), blocking the approach of dendrite growth. Above combined functions lead to substantial enhancement in long&#8208;term stability and cell capacity, as proved by 10&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn symmetric cells and 57&#8201;% capacity increasement of Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cells (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) compared with that of pure Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte.

         <title>The Continuum Between Hexagonal Planar and Trigonal Planar Geometries

The isolation and bonding analysis of a series of heterometallic hydride complexes shows they have subtly different bonding geometries. These compounds can be described as snapshots along a continuum of bonding between trigonal and hexagonal planar geometries.







Abstract
New heterometallic hydride complexes that involve the addition of {Mg&#8722;H} and {Zn&#8722;H} bonds to group 10 transition metals (Pd, Pt) are reported. The side&#8208;on coordination of a single {Mg&#8722;H} to Pd forms a well&#8208;defined &#963;&#8208;complex. In contrast, addition of three {Mg&#8722;H} or {Zn&#8722;H} bonds to Pd or Pt results in the formation of planar complexes with subtly different geometries. We compare their structures through experiment (X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, multinuclear NMR), computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, NCIPlot), and theoretical analysis (MO diagram, Walsh diagram). These species can be described as snapshots along a continuum of bonding between ideal trigonal planar and hexagonal planar geometries.

         <title>Unraveling the Complex Chirality Evolution in DNA&#8208;Assembled High&#8208;Order, Hybrid Chiroplasmonic Superstructures from Multi&#8208;Scale Chirality Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;scale chirality evolution was observed from DNA&#8208;assembled hybrid chiroplasmonic superstructures comprised of metal nanoparticles and organic chromophores, as a result of distinct fundamental chiral interactions at different hierarchical levels. The findings present new challenges to current theoretical frameworks to describe chiral hybrid systems, and will motivate computational and theoretical advances.







Abstract
Hierarchical, chiral hybrid superstructures of chromophores and nanoparticles are expected to give rise to intriguing unveiled chiroptical responses originating from the complex chiral interactions among the components. Herein, DNA origami cavity that could self&#8208;assemble into one&#8208;dimensional (1D) DNA tubes was employed as a scaffold to accurately organize metal nanoparticles and chromophores. The chiral interactions were studied at the level of individual hybrid particles and their 1D hybrid superstructures. Complex chirality mechanisms involving global structural chirality, plasmon&#8208;induced circular dichroism (PICD) and exciton&#8208;coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) were disentangled. The multiplexed CD spectrum superposition revealed the chirality evolution at different length scales. These results can offer a model for boosting the theoretical understanding of classical&#8208;quantum hybrid systems, and would inspire the future design of optically&#8208;active substances across length scales.

         <title>Programmable Assembly of Multivalent DNA&#8208;Protein Superstructures for Tumor Imaging and Targeted Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multivalent DNA nanomaterials are designed through the biomimetic assembly of DNA with Food and Drug Administration&#8208;approved protamine, providing biocompatible and stable drug carriers with high avidity in a simpler method. This practical approach achieves sensitive tumor imaging and targeted cancer therapy, and offers new clinical translation opportunities.







Abstract
Programmable DNA materials hold great potential in biochemical and biomedical researches, yet the complicated synthesis, and the low stability and targeting efficacy in complex biological milieu limit their clinical translations. Here we show a one&#8208;pot assembly of DNA&#8208;protein superstructures as drug vehicles with specifically high affinity and stability for targeted therapy. This is achieved by biomimetic assembly of programmable polymer DNA wire into densely packed DNA nanosphere with an alkaline protein, protamine. Multivalent DNA nanostructures encoded with different types and densities of aptamers exhibit high affinity to targeted cells through polyvalent interaction. Our results show high cancer cell selectivity, reduced side effect, excellent therapeutic efficacy, and sensitive tumor imaging in both subcutaneous and orthotopic non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer murine models. This biomimetic assembly approach provides practical DNA nanomaterials for further clinical trials and may advance oligonucleotide drug delivery.

         <title>Synergistic Interfacial Bonding in Reduced Graphene Oxide Fiber Cathodes Containing Polypyrrole@sulfur Nanospheres for Flexible Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a synergistic interface bonding strategy to construct novel flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres (&#8776;500&#8197;nm) are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. The PPy@S/rGOFs cathode exhibits good mechanical property, excellent electronic conductivity and enhanced cycling performance and outstanding high&#8208;rate capacity.







Abstract
Flexible lithium sulfur batteries with high energy density and good mechanical flexibility are highly desirable. Here, we report a synergistic interface bonding enhancement strategy to construct flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. In this architecture, sulfur nanospheres and lithium polysulfides are synergistically hosted by carbon and polymer interface, which work together to provide enhanced interface chemical bonding to endow the cathode with good adsorption ability, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent mechanical flexibility. Consequently, the PPy@S/rGOFs cathode shows enhanced electrochemical performance and high&#8208;rate capability. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to elucidate the enhanced electrochemical performance. In addition, a flexible Li&#8722;S pouch cell is assembled and delivers a high areal capacity of 5.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work offers a new strategy for preparation of advanced cathodes for flexible batteries.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Solid Superprotonic Supramolecular Polymer Electrolytes Based on Deep Eutectic Solvents and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate nanoclusters are used as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify deep eutectic solvents, which creates semi&#8208;solid supramolecular polymer electrolytes with superprotonic conductivity. Upon mild heating, these electrolytes can infiltrate into the voids in supercapacitor electrodes, form highly stable interfaces, and lead to improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) exhibit intriguing benefits in functional soft materials due to their dynamic bonding feature. However, most SPs can only exist in the solution state and fail to form bulk materials, which limits their applications. Here, we report the fabrication of semi&#8208;solid bulk SP materials by using polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters as supramolecular cross&#8208;linkers to solidify a deep eutectic solvent (DES). The abundant protons and strong hydrogen bonds afforded by POMs enable these SP materials as superprotonic conductive electrolytes with sufficient mechanical strength, showing a proton conductivity more than 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a breaking strength exceeding 1&#8197;MPa at room temperature. Moreover, the thermodynamic reversibility of the SP electrolytes allows them to form a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by a facile melt&#8208;infiltration strategy upon mild heating, which leads to improved performance in supercapacitors. This work presents an innovative DES/POM hybrid system as a promising platform to develop functional supramolecular materials for energy and electronic applications.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;heterolepticity in Low&#8208;Symmetry Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages are prized for their structural complexity and multi&#8208;functionality. Controlling integrative self&#8208;sorting processes necessary to achieve defined self&#8208;assembly of these supramolecular hosts is a significant design challenge. In this work, ligand&#8208;tethering strategies are described that allow access to metal&#8208;organic cages with highly anisotropic cavities described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand scaffolds.







Abstract
Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages, formed through integrative self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, are highly attractive as reduced symmetry supramolecular hosts. Ensuring high&#8208;fidelity, non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly, however, presents a significant challenge in molecular engineering due to the inherent difficulty in predicting thermodynamic energy landscapes. In this work, two conceptual strategies are described that circumvent this issue, using ligand design strategies to access structurally sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts. Using these approaches, it was possible to realise cavity environments described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand frameworks, representing a significant step forward in the construction of highly anisotropic confined spaces.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Preparation of Twisted Graphene Nanoribbons by Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly twisted and fully armchair&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) have been synthesized by Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling. These twisted AGNRs have lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm and display strong emission with a fluorescence quantum yield up to 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising in organic optoelectronic materials, and their properties largely depend on the size, edge, and conformation. Herein, the fully armchair&#8208;edged GNRs (AGNRs) with lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm by using a Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling as a key step. The resulting AGNRs (2HBT, 3HBT, and 4HBT) possess highly twisted &#960;&#8208;scaffolds, and the torsion angles between the adjacent triphenylene moieties are larger than 32&#176;, as proved by crystallographic analyses. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies show that the butoxy groups endow AGNRs with electron&#8208;rich features, the extension of the &#960;&#8208;system from 2HBT to 4HBT reinforces S0&#8594;S1 excitation, and the distortion of the &#960;&#8208;scaffold enhances the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F). In particular, 4HBT has the lowest oxidation potential (Eox1=0.55&#8197;V vs. SCE) and displays red fluorescence with a &#934;F value of 81&#8201;%.

         <title>The First Chiro&#8208;Inositol Organosilicon Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;component organosilicon ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 is designed by using the chemical strategy of introducing quasi&#8208;spherical [&#8208;Si(CH3)3] groups into D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol. It exhibits stable and electrically switchable spontaneous polarization on the thin film, which has extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Organosilicons have been used extensively in aerospace, electronics, food, medicine and other fields, due to their low viscosity, hydrophobicity, corrosion resistance, non&#8208;toxic, and physiologically inert features. Despite extensive interest, however, organosilicon ferroelectric crystals have never been found. Here, by using the chemical design strategy, we successfully obtained a molecular ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 with polar P43 symmetry, whose spontaneous polarization can be electrically switchable on thin film. The introduction of organosilicon groups endows the thin films with excellent softness, ductility and flexibility (extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa) that are desirable for biomedical and human&#8208;compatible applications. As the first case of organosilicon ferroelectric crystal to date, this work offers a new structural paradigm for molecular ferroelectrics, and highlights their potential for flexible bio&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Differential Peptide Multi&#8208;Macrocyclizations at the Surface of a Helical Foldamer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of different macrocycles can be implemented using Cys residues within a peptide and chloroacetamides at the surface of a foldamer helix by placing the latter at precise locations. Helix rigidity and faster formation of smaller macrocycles make the favored product largely predictable.







Abstract
Hybrid sequences comprising a peptide with several Cys residues and an aromatic foldamer helix with several chloroacetamide functions at its surface were synthesized. Such products may in principle form numerous macromulticyclic thioether products by intramolecularly combining all Cys residues and all chloroacetamide functions. However, we show that the reactive sites on the structurally defined helix can be placed at such locations that the peptide selectively stitches itself to form a series of different macrocycles within mostly one preferred product. Reactions were monitored by HPLC and products with two, three or four macrocycles were identified using LC&#8211;MS and NMR. The series of selective macrocyclizations define a sort of reaction trail where reaction sites otherwise identical are involved successively because of their precise positioning in space. The trails can be predicted to a large extent based on structural considerations and the assumption that smaller macrocycles form faster.

         <title>Activity&#8208;based Photoacoustic Probes Reveal Elevated Intestinal MGL and FAAH Activity in a Murine Model of Obesity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based sensing probes and whole&#8208;body photoacoustic imaging have enabled the selective detection of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity in the context of obesity and gastrointestinal tract inflammation.







Abstract
Obesity is a chronic health condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive body fat which can lead to and exacerbate cardiovascular disease, type&#8208;II diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer through systemic inflammation. Unfortunately, visualizing key mediators of the inflammatory response, such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), in a selective manner is a profound challenge owing to an overlapping substrate scope that involves arachidonic acid (AA). Specifically, these enzymes work in concert to generate AA, which in the context of obesity, has been implicated to control appetite and energy metabolism. In this study, we developed the first selective activity&#8208;based sensing probes to detect MGL (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL) and FAAH (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH) activity via photoacoustic imaging. Activation of PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH by their target enzymes resulted in 1.74&#8208;fold and 1.59&#8208;fold signal enhancements, respectively. Due to their exceptional selectivity profiles and deep&#8208;tissue photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these probes were employed to measure MGL and FAAH activity in a murine model of obesity. Contrary to conflicting reports suggesting levels of MGL can be attenuated or elevated, our results support the latter. Indeed, we discovered a marked increase of both targets in the gastrointestinal tract. These key findings set the stage to uncover the role of the endocannabinoid pathway in obesity&#8208;mediated inflammation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Excited Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Silyl&#8208;Radical&#8208;Mediated Direct Activation of Carbamoyl Chlorides To Access (Hetero)aryl Carbamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcited nickel catalysis enabled silyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of carbamoyl chlorides. This process provides an operationally simple and widely applicable amidation reaction of a plethora of aryl and heteroaryl halides. Mechanistic understanding suggests that the reaction involves an energy&#8208;transfer mechanism for aryl bromide; while a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is operating for aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Amide bonds connect the amino acids in proteins and exist as a prevalent structural motif in biomolecules. Herein, we have exploited the concept of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling by merging the photo&#8208;redox and transition&#8208;metal catalysis to construct carbamides from superabundant (hetero)aryl halides along with commercially feasible carbamoyl chlorides. The success of this method relies on the prior formation of NiII&#8208;aryl halide intermediates, which involves in a photoexcited Ni&#8208;halide homolysis event by energy transfer from aryl bromide and single&#8208;electron transfer from aryl chloride to assist generation of the vital carbamoyl radical. The breadth of application of this technique is demonstrated both in inter&#8208; as well as intramolecular routes for the synthesis of a plethora of (hetero)aryl carbamides with diverse functionalities, and biologically important benzolactams.

         <title>Conservation of Nickel Ion Single&#8208;Active Site Character in a Bottom&#8208;Up Constructed &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecular Network</title>

The on&#8208;surface synthesis of covalent nickel tetraphenylporphyrin network on Au(111) is studied by a multitechnique approach combining local microscopic insights with space&#8208;averaging synchrotron radiation&#8208;based methods. Even though the porphyrin nanomesh is not perfectly ordered extending the &#960;&#8208;system results in the appearance of energy&#8208;dispersive electronic features while the Ni cores remain in the characteristic single&#8208;molecule configuration.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemistry holds the potential for ultimate miniaturization of functional devices. Porphyrins are promising building&#8208;blocks in exploring advanced nanoarchitecture concepts. More stable molecular materials of practical interest with improved charge transfer properties can be achieved by covalently interconnecting molecular units. On&#8208;surface synthesis allows to construct extended covalent nanostructures at interfaces not conventionally available. Here, we address the synthesis and properties of covalent molecular network composed of interconnected constituents derived from halogenated nickel tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(111). We report that the &#960;&#8208;extended two&#8208;dimensional material exhibits dispersive electronic features. Concomitantly, the functional Ni cores retain the same single&#8208;active site character of their single&#8208;molecule counterparts. This opens new pathways when exploiting the high robustness of transition metal cores provided by bottom&#8208;up constructed covalent nanomeshes.

         <title>2,4,6&#8208;Trimethylpyridine&#8208;Derived Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Confined Catalytic Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knoevenagel condensation at the methyl groups of a 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine monomer was promoted by in situ acylation of the nitrogen atom, yielding highly crystalline vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. The resultant Lewis basic, pyridine&#8208;decorated, regular, nanoporous structures catalyzed spatially confined organic esterification with good selectivity.







Abstract
Knoevenagel condensation is a powerful tool for the construction of vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. Herein, we established a concise approach to vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation at the multi&#8208;methyl groups of a pyridine ring through in situ formation of an N&#8208;acyl pyridinium cation in the presence of various acylating reagents. Following this strategy, two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine and multi&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;substituted aromatic derivatives as monomers. The resultant COFs are highly crystalline and assembled into hexagonal lattices with specific surface areas as large as 1915&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (vs. 1972&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of the theoretical value). The stable and abundant pyridine&#8208;decorated regular nanochannels within the COFs allow for catalyzing the esterification of several pharmaceutical intermediates with distinct spatially confined selectivity and recyclability, representing an environmentally friendly catalytic organic transformation.

The resultant COFs are highly crystalline and assembled into hexagonal lattices with specific surface areas as large as 1915&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (vs. 1972&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of the theoretical value). The stable and abundant pyridine-decorated regular nanochannels within the COFs allow for catalyzing the esterification of several pharmaceutical intermediates with distinct spatially confined selectivity and recyclability, representing an environmentally friendly catalytic organic transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intranuclear Nanoribbons for Selective Killing of Osteosarcoma Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon the dephosphorylation of ALP, the leucine&#8208;rich phosphopeptides self&#8208;assemble into micelles and then convert into nanoribbons. The phosphopeptides/assemblies first aggregate on the cell membrane of osteosarcoma cells, and then enter cells via endocytosis, disrupt the nuclear membrane, and finally accumulate in nuclei by interaction with histone proteins to induce cell death.







Abstract
Herein, we show intranuclear nanoribbons formed upon dephosphorylation of leucine&#8208;rich L&#8208; or D&#8208;phosphopeptide catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to selectively kill osteosarcoma cells. Being dephosphorylated by ALP, the peptides are first transformed into micelles and then converted into nanoribbons. The peptides/assemblies first aggregate on cell membranes, then enter cells via endocytosis, and finally accumulate in nuclei (mainly in nucleoli). Proteomics analysis suggests that the assemblies interact with histone proteins. The peptides kill osteosarcoma cells rapidly and are nontoxic to normal cells. Moreover, the repeated stimulation of the osteosarcoma cells by the peptides sensitizes the cancer cells rather than inducing resistance. This work not only illustrates a novel mechanism for nucleus targeting, but may also pave a new way for selectively killing osteosarcoma cells and minimizing drug resistance.

         <title>Regulating Surface Reaction Kinetics through Ligand Field Effects for Fast and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>

The boron acid additive can alleviate the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction by modulating the solvation sheath. The formed solvation structure with moderate ligand field strength enables fast and highly reversible Zn deposition.







Abstract
Designing water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath of Zn2+ by ligand substitution is a widely used strategy to protect Zn metal anode, yet the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the side hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a huge challenge. Herein, we find boric acid (BA) with moderate ligand field interaction can partially replace H2O molecules in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, forming a stable water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath. It enables fast Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and substantially suppressed HER. Crucially, by systematically comparing the ligand field strength and solvation energies between BA and the ever&#8208;reported electrolyte additives, we also find that the solvation energy has a strong correlation with Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and HER inhibition ability, displaying a classic volcano behavior. The modulation map could provide valuable insights for solvation sheath design of zinc batteries and beyond.

         <title>3D Blockage Mapping for Identifying Familial Point Mutations in Single Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides with a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of single&#8208;point mutants of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide associated with familial Alzheimer's disease were simultaneously identified with aerolysin nanopores assisted by a 3D blockage mapping strategy. This is based on the combination of the conventional current blockage (Ib/I0), duration time (tD) and the reliable standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b).







Abstract
Accurate discrimination of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides containing familial point mutations would advance the knowledge of their roles in early&#8208;onset Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we simultaneously identified the mutant A21G, E22G, E22Q, and the wild&#8208;type (WT) A&#946;18&#8211;26 peptides with aerolysin nanopore using a 3D blockage mapping strategy. The standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b) was proposed as a new supplement to current blockage (Ib/I0) and duration time (tD) to profile the blockage characteristics of single molecules. Although the WT and A21G A&#946;18&#8208;26 are indistinguishable in a traditional Ib/I0&#8208;tD 2D description, &#8764;87&#8201;% of the blockade events can be accurately classified with half reduction of false identification using a combination of Ib/I0, tD, and &#963;b. This work offers an easy and reliable strategy to promote nanopore sensitivity of peptide mutants, leading to a more precise analysis of pathogenic mutations for developing effective diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Ultrastable Anti&#8208;Acid &#8220;Shield&#8221; in Layered Silver Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid resistance (12&#8197;M HCl) was made possible for two isomorphic two&#8208;dimensional silver&#8208;based coordination polymers. Protection is provided by a hydrophobic organic shell and a dynamic proton buffer layer via a thiolate&#8208;thione tautomerism of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole ligands. Thus, these ligands are promising surface inhibitors, acting as a dual protective shield against metal corrosion.







Abstract
Surface passivation technology provides noble&#8208;metal materials with limited chemical stability, especially under highly acidic condition. To design effective strategy to enhance stability of noble&#8208;metal particles, an understanding of their surface anticorrosion mechanism at the atomic level is desirable by using two&#8208;dimensional (2D) noble&#8208;metal coordination polymer (CP) as an ideal model for their interfacial region. With the protection of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole (TBI), we isolated two Ag&#8208;based 2D CPs, {Ag14(TBI)12X2}n (S&#8722;X, where S denotes sheet and X=Cl or Br). These compounds exhibited excellent chemical stability upon immersion in various common solvents, boiling water, boiling ethanol, 10&#8201;% hydrogen peroxide, concentrated acid (12&#8197;M HCl), and concentrated alkali (19&#8197;M NaOH). Systematic characterization and DFT analyses demonstrate that the superior stability of S&#8722;X was attributed to the hydrophobic organic shell and dynamic proton buffer layer acting as a double protective &#8220;shield&#8221;.

         <title>sp2 to sp3 Hybridization Transformation in Ionic Crystals under Unprecedentedly Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation in ionic crystals, the realization of internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic groups to covalent groups is proposed. It is demonstrated in a crystal of LiBO2 which undergoes the transformation at unprecedentedly low pressure of only 2.85&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Under cold pressure sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation has been exclusively observed in covalent or molecular crystals overwhelmingly above &#8776;10&#8197;GPa, and the approaches to lower the transition pressure are limited on external heat&#8208;treatment and/or catalyzers. Herein we demonstrate that, by internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic to covalent groups, the transformation can be significantly prompted, as shown in a crystal of LiBO2 under 2.85&#8197;GPa for the first case in ionic crystals. This unprecedentedly low transformation pressure is ascribed to the enhanced localized stress on covalent B&#8722;O frames transferred from ionic Li&#8722;O bonds in LiBO2, and accordingly the corresponding structural feature is summarized. This work provides an internal structural regulation strategy for pressure&#8208;reduction of the s&#8208;p orbital hybridization transformation and extends the sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 transformation landscape from molecular and covalent compounds to ionic systems.

         <title>Oxidative Radical NHC Catalysis: Divergent Difunctionalization of Olefins through Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalytic system is reported that allows an efficient difunctionalization of olefins for the divergent synthesis of various ketones. Key to success is the use of peroxyesters as &#8220;dual&#8208;role&#8221; reagents to achieve a sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation and intermolecular hydron atom transfer.







Abstract
Oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, typically leading to the formation of acyl azolium reactive intermediates, constitutes one of the most important activation strategies for the NHC&#8208;catalyzed chemical transformations. Here, we report an unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalysis by using peroxyester as the external single&#8208;electron oxidant to realize divergent difunctionalization of olefins. The key to success of this chemistry is the catalytic generation of oxygen radicals that could trigger an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer to activate the inert C&#8722;H bonds, thereby enabling the productive radical relay process. With this protocol, commonly used general chemicals could serve as radical precursors to allow efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added products in a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective manner. Preliminary mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the NHC organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

         <title>Polymerisation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Graft Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of branching on polymer self&#8208;assembly is investigated by conducting polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of sparsely grafted poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) in n&#8208;dodecane. Electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray scattering techniques are used to characterise the resulting materials.







Abstract
We report the polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of poly(lauryl methacrylate)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate) copolymers during reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) grafting from polymerisation in a backbone&#8208;selective solvent. Electron microscopy images suggest the phase separation of grafts to result in a network of spherical particles, due to the ability of the branched architecture to freeze chain entanglements and to bridge core domains. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering data suggest the architecture promotes the formation of multicore micelles, the core morphology of which transitions from spheres to worms, vesicles, and inverted micelles with increasing volume fraction of the grafts. A time&#8208;resolved SAXS study is presented to illustrate the formation of the inverted phase during a polymerisation. The grafted architecture gives access to unusual morphologies and provides exciting new handles for controlling the polymer structure and material properties.

         <title>The Linkage of Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides and Unactivated Alkenes via Hydrosulfonimidoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free linkage chemistry of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes is presented. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step in the reaction.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI) fluoride cleavage and exchanging linkage, a new generation of linkage chemistry, exhibits enormous potential for combining a range of functional molecules in an increasing number of fields. Herein, we established a metal&#8208;free linkage of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step, and it occurs via overlap of the LUMO in the sulfonimidoyl cation and HOMO in the unactivated alkene, which was confirmed via control experiments with deuterated compounds. DFT calculations further demonstrated the concerted process involving formation of the S&#8722;C(sp3) bond and hydride transfer. Remarkably, abundant natural products and pharmaceuticals with multiple heteroatoms and sensitive functional groups have been subjected to the current linkage reaction to achieve various sulfoximine linkages, furnishing the basis for drug discovery and drug conjugation.

         <title>In Vivo Olefin Metathesis in Microalgae Upgrades Lipids to Building Blocks for Polymers and Chemicals</title>

Catalytic olefin metathesis can be performed in live microalgae, converting the fatty acids stored in lipid organelles to polymer building blocks and chemicals in vivo.







Abstract
Sustainable sources are key to future chemicals production. Microalgae are promising resources as they fixate carbon dioxide to organic molecules by photosynthesis. Thereby they produce unsaturated fatty acids as established raw materials for the industrial production of chemical building blocks. Although these renewable feedstocks are generated inside cells, their catalytic upgrading to useful products requires in vitro transformations. A synthetic catalysis inside photoautotrophic cells has remained elusive. Here we show that a catalytic conversion of renewable substrates can be realized directly inside living microalgae. Organometallic catalysts remain active inside the cells, enabling in vivo catalytic olefin metathesis as new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformation. Stored lipids are converted to long&#8208;chain dicarboxylates as valuable building blocks for polymers. This is a key step towards the long&#8208;term goal of producing desired renewable chemicals in microalgae as living &#8220;cellular factories&#8221;.

         <dc:description>
Fusion of azulene to acenes of various length led to unexpected properties such as aromaticity and photophysical properties, and they are more stable than the respective isoelectronic acenes. Their dications showed aromaticity shift and one of them exhibited open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are expected to exhibit very different electronic properties from the all&#8208;benzenoid PHs. Herein, we report the synthesis and physical properties of three azulene&#8208;fused acene molecules (1, 2 and 3), which are isoelectronic to the pentacene, hexacene and heptacene, respectively. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR spectra, and theoretical calculations reveal a localised aromatic backbone comprising all the six&#8208; and five&#8208;membered rings while the seven&#8208;membered ring remains non&#8208;aromatic. They display properties of both azulene and acenes and are much more stable than the respective acenes. The dications of 1, 2 and 3 were formed by chemical oxidation. Notably, 32+ exhibited an open&#8208;shell diradical character (y0=30.2&#8201;%) as confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR and ESR measurements, which can be explained by recovery of aromaticity of an 2,6&#8208;anthraquinodimethane unit annulated with two aromatic tropylium rings.

         <title>Conferring BiVO4 Nanorods with Oxygen Vacancies to Realize Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoetching can confer BiVO4 with oxygen vacancies and enhance the catalytic performance of BiVO4. The photoetched BiVO4 can catalyze water splitting to generate oxygen and hydroxyl radicals under the mediation of ultrasound. The generated oxygen can relieve tumor hypoxia, thereby improving the sonodynamic cancer therapy performance of BiVO4.







Abstract
Owing to the high depth of tissue penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown broad application prospects for tumor treatment. However, the electron&#8208;hole separation inefficiency of sonosensitizers and the tumor hypoxia remain two major challenges limiting the effect of SDT. Here, ultrafine photoetched bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanorods modified with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 (PEBVO@PEG NRs) were fabricated to achieve in situ self&#8208;supply of oxygen (O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for hypoxic tumor therapy. The photoetching approach could enhance the charge separation by inducing enriched oxygen vacancies on the surface of BiVO4, thereby improving the generation efficiency of ROS and O2. The PEBVO@PEG overcome the main obstacles of traditional sonosensitizers in the SDT process and show promising sonodynamic therapeutic effects, thus providing new strategies for improving the performance of sonosensitizer and hypoxic tumor elimination.

         <title>Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 Stabilized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium Catalyst for Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed single&#8208;atom Rh embedded on Ti&#8208;doped CeO2, which exhibited record&#8208;breaking TOF of 493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1, 99.1&#8201;% ethanol selectivity and outstanding stability in CO2 hydrogenation. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doping and single&#8208;atom Rh favor CHx*/CO* formation and their subsequent coupling into ethanol. Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction leads to the stabilization of single&#8208;atom Rh site and catalytic stability.







Abstract
Development of effective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol remains a challenge. Herein, we report that Rh1/CeTiOx single&#8208;atom catalyst constructed by embedding monoatomic Rh onto Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 support has shown a super high ethanol selectivity (&#8776;99.1&#8201;%), record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency (493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1), and outstanding stability. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doption and monoatomic Rh contribute to this excellent catalytic performance by firstly facilitating oxygen vacancies formation to generate oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;Rh Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;base pairs, which favor CO2 adsorption and activation, cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds in CHxOH* and COOH* into CHx* and CO* species, subsequent C&#8722;C coupling and hydrogenation into ethanol, and secondly generating strong Rh&#8722;O bond by Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction, which contributes to striking stability. This work highlights the importance of support elaborating regulation for single&#8208;atom catalyst design to substantially improve the catalytic performance.

         <title>Regioselective Access to Vicinal Diamines by Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitized Amidylimination of Alkenes with Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, photosensitized regioselective diamination of alkene is reported. The keys to this advance are: 1)&#8197;rational design of bifunctional diamination reagent, 2)&#8197;simultaneous generation of long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical with significantly differed reactivities, and 3)&#8197;involvement of photoinduced energy transfer reaction mode.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free photosensitized protocol for regioselective diamination of alkene feedstocks over a single step was developed based on the rationally designed bifunctional diamination reagent, thus affording a range of differentially protected 1,2&#8208;diamines in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction is initiated with a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone catalyst and diamination reagent, followed by fragmentation to simultaneously generate long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical. The excellent regioselectivity presumably stems from the large reactivity difference between two different N&#8208;centered radical species. This protocol is characterized by excellent regioselectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions, which would enrich the diversity and versatility of facilitate the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diamine&#8208;containing complex molecule scaffolds.

         <title>Unique Double Intramolecular and Intermolecular Exciton Coupling in Ethene&#8208;Bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY Dimers for High&#8208;Efficiency Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;BODIPY dimer exhibits unique double intra&#8208; and intermolecular exciton couplings, resulting in a dramatic red&#8208;shift of the absorption to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. Its self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles have high photothermal conversion ability and are ultra&#8208;photostable, which can efficiently lead to complete tumor ablation under 915&#8197;nm laser irradiation with ultralow power density.







Abstract
Spatial electronic communications of chromophores are both theoretically and practically fascinating. Despite intramolecular or intermolecular exciton coupling was observed in multichromophoric oligomers and J&#8208;aggregates, respectively, it is unusual that they both occur in the same molecule. Herein, ethene&#8208;bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY dimers with intramolecular exciton splitting have been developed. By encapsulating the dimer into F&#8208;127 polymer, J&#8208;type aggregated nanoparticles were produced, which showed obvious intermolecular exciton coupling and dramatically redshifted absorption and emission peaks at 936 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. The fabricated nanoagents have high photothermal conversion ability (&#951;=60.3&#8201;%) and are ultra&#8208;photostable, leading to complete tumor ablation with 915&#8197;nm laser irradiation. This phototherapeutic nanoplatform through modulating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular exciton couplings is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor treatment.

By encapsulating the dimer into F-127 polymer, &lt;i&gt;J-&lt;/i&gt;type aggregated nanoparticles were produced, which showed obvious intermolecular exciton coupling and dramatically redshifted absorption and emission peaks at 936 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. The fabricated nanoagents have high photothermal conversion ability (&#951;=60.3&#8201;%) and are ultra-photostable, leading to complete tumor ablation with 915&#8197;nm laser irradiation. This phototherapeutic nanoplatform through modulating both intra- and intermolecular exciton couplings is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An adaptable strategy toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior was developed. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.







Abstract
A versatile strategy for smart fluorescent materials is lacking due to their diverse responding mechanisms and incompatibility of responsive behaviors. Herein an adaptable strategy is presented toward a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior by blending linear polymers modified with different stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties and AIE cross&#8208;linker. Under stimuli, the linear polymer can cross&#8208;link with the cross&#8208;linker to form networks, which intrinsically restrict the intramolecular rotation of the AIE molecule to induce strong emission. A unified stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is involved in that various stimuli are transferred through the organized &#8220;stimulus&#8208;crosslink&#8208;emission&#8221; process. This strategy ensures the compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.

         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid catalysed asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allenyl imide and alkenes was developed by Xiaohua Liu, Xiaoming Feng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202211596). This protocol provided a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A stepwise mechanism was proposed based on experimental studies and DFT calculations, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions were identified as crucial for the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Back Cover: Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO is a promising approach for the cyclic use of CO2, but still suffers from impractical current density and durability. A single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210985). Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N4 site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N5 site has significant differences in the dz&#178; and dxz/yz orbital energy levels. Thus the Ni&#8722;N5 catalytic site has superior properties in activating CO2 molecules and promoting CO desorption.

Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) face several challenges, such as unstable Zn anodes and a low Zn ion transference number. A unique anion&#8208;trap strategy based on the host&#8211;guest interaction between &#946;&#8208;CD and anions is proposed by Chunyi Zhi, Wenjie Mai, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210979) to greatly improve the overall performance in terms of both capacity and stability of ZIBs via promoting the Zn ion transfer ability and assisting the formation of reorientated dominant Zn(002) facets on the Zn anode.

A unique anion-trap strategy based on the host&#8211;guest interaction between &#946;-CD and anions is proposed by Chunyi Zhi, Wenjie Mai, and co-workers in their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202210979"&gt;(e202210979)&lt;/a&gt; to greatly improve the overall performance in terms of both capacity and stability of ZIBs via promoting the Zn ion transfer ability and assisting the formation of reorientated dominant Zn(002) facets on the Zn anode.

         <dc:description>
The precise co&#8208;conformation regulation of topologically chiral [2]catenanes under two different external stimuli led to the construction of a bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch, as reported by Xiao He, Wei Wang, Hai&#8208;Bo Yang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210542). The results provide not only an attractive approach towards the construction of multistate CPL switches for practical uses but also a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

         <title>Morphological Anisotropy in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Micro/Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework micro/nanoparticles (MOF MNPs) are reviewed with a focus on their morphological anisotropy, which plays a unique role in producing innovative structures and regulating properties with enhanced performance.







Abstract
Anisotropy plays a unique role in the structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites, especially at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale. However, there is a lack of a understanding of MOF micro/nanoparticles (MNPs) from the perspective of morphological anisotropy. In this Minireview, recent advances in anisotropic MOF MNPs are summarized, with a focus on how morphological anisotropy leads to innovative structures and modulates properties. First, anisotropic pristine MOF MNPs with diverse morphologies are introduced and classified by their morphology&#8208;dependent and morphology&#8208;independent anisotropy. Secondly, the anisotropy&#8208;enabled site&#8208;selective higher&#8208;order construction of MOF&#8208;based materials is highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for anisotropic MOFs are discussed, aiming to provide inspiration for further developments in this interesting research field.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal Complexes for Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction: From Adjustment of Intrinsic Activity to Molecular Immobilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) including metal bipyridines and macrocycle complexes, and summarizes the molecular engineering strategies developed to regulate the intrinsic catalytic efficiency and modify the electrode. Guidelines are provided for the rational design of ECO2RR catalytic systems.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is one promising method for storing intermittent clean energy in chemical bonds and producing fuels. Among various kinds of catalysts for ECO2RR, molecular metal complexes with well&#8208;defined structures are convenient for studies of their rational design, structure&#8211;reactivity relationships, and mechanisms. In this Review, we summarize the molecular engineering of several N&#8208;based metal complexes including Re/Mn bipyridine compounds and metal macrocycles, concluding with general modification strategies to devise novel molecular catalysts with high intrinsic activity. Through physical adsorption, covalent linking, and formation of a periodic backbone, these active molecules can be heterogenized into immobilized catalysts with more practical prospects. Finally, significant challenges and opportunities based on molecular catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Regioselective Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C(sp2)&#8722;H Borylation: A Subject of Practical and Ongoing Interest in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in strategies for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation are summarized in this Review. Strategies developed to control the regioselectivity of the electrophilic borylation, such as approaches controlled by electronic effects, auxiliaries, and steric factors, are also discussed. EDG=electron donating group, DG=directing group, TM=transition metal.







Abstract
Considerable advances have been made in the area of C&#8722;H functionalization in the last few decades. A number of approaches including both directed and nondirected strategies have been developed thus far. Among the various C&#8722;H functionalizations, C&#8722;H borylation is of special interest due to the wide applications of organoboron compounds. In this regard, various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regioselective strategies have been developed. However, the major concern regarding metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation procedures is the requirement of a precious metal as well as the contamination by metal precursors in the desired products, which limit the application of this process in large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, recent trends have involved the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free systems. We summarize recent developments in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective C&#8722;H borylation. We believe that this Review will help to increase interest in this field and stimulate further progress.

         <title>Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining Using Chemometric Methods: A Need for Chemists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big (Bio)Chemical Data Mining: Large and complex chemical data sets generated by modern analytical technologies have led to the so&#8208;called Big (Bio)Chemical Data era. These data sets can be produced using modern analytical instruments such as multi&#8208;dimensional chromatography, high&#8208;resolution and multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging and DNA/RNA microarrays. Chemometric methods have shown potential to analyze BBCD especially in omics sciences and chemical toxicology/drug discovery.







Abstract
This Review summarizes how big (bio)chemical data (BBCD) can be analyzed with multivariate chemometric methods and highlights some of the important challenges faced by modern analytical researches. Here, the potential of chemometric methods to solve BBCD problems that are being encountered in chromatographic, spectroscopic and hyperspectral imaging measurements will be discussed, with an emphasis on their applications to omics sciences. In addition, insights and perspectives on how to address the analysis of BBCD are provided along with a discussion of the procedures necessary to obtain more reliable qualitative and quantitative results. In this Review, the importance of &#8220;big data&#8221; and of their relevance to (bio)chemistry are first discussed. Thereafter, analytical tools which can produce BBCD are presented as well as the theoretical background of chemometric methods and their limitations when they are applied to BBCD. Finally, the importance of chemometric methods for the analysis of BBCD in different chemical disciplines is highlighted with some examples. In this work, we have tried to cover many of the current applications of big data analysis in the (bio)chemistry field.

         <title>Polycyclic Hydrocarbons from [4n]Annulenes: Correlation versus Hybridization Forces in the Formation of Diradicaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptual electronic structure trip from [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromatics to diradicaloids and to more hierarchical complex molecular shapes made by internal covalent hybridization of the peripheral [4n] &#960;&#8208;electron circuit is described. Focus is on the underlying physical organic chemistry implications.







Abstract
The conceptual connections between [4n] H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, disjoint orbitals, correlation energy, pro&#8208;aromaticity and diradical character for a variety of extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, including some salient recent examples of nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic radicals, are provided based on their [4n]annulene peripheries. The realization of such structure&#8211;property relationships has led to a beneficial pedagogic exercise establishing design guidelines for diradicaloids. The antiaromatic fingerprint of the [4n]annulene peripheries upon orbital interactions due to internal covalent connectors gives insights into the diradicaloid property of a diversity of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules that have fascinated chemists recently.

         <title>Optically Controlled Thermochromic Switching for Multi&#8208;Input Molecular Logic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We ideally design azobenzenes with alkyl chains (AZO(n)) as a photo trigger in the leuco dye based thermochromic system. The color developer in this system can be reversibly locked by Z&#8208;AZO(n), so that the leuco dye cannot capture the proton from the color developer to form the larger conjugate structure, while it can be released upon Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization. This new strategy can be considered as a possible multi&#8208;input molecular logic system.







Abstract
Leuco dye&#8208;based thermochromic materials offer enormous potential for visible molecular logic due to the appealing reversible color&#8208;changing effect. The stable color state is uncontrollable as it depends only on the spontaneous protonation of the leuco dye and color developer. There is still a challenge to propose an effective approach to control bistable color function at required temperature. A family of azobenzenes with various alkyl chains (AZO(n)) is designed for protonation competition with leuco dye. The hydrogen bond and Van der Waals forces are formed between color developer and AZO(n). The color developer can be locked to provide the proton for the leuco dye by Z&#8208;AZO(n), while it can be released upon Z&#8208;to&#8208;E photoisomerization. The locked state can be lasted for more than 16&#8197;hours. This optically controlled leuco dye&#8208;based system demonstrates a visible sequential logic operation with four&#8208;input signals, and provides a new type of protonation&#8208;based optical control.

         <dc:description>
A combination of photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation enables cascade reactions of cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;olefins, in which two rings and three bonds are constructed in one reaction, affording fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope, complete cis&#8208;selectivity, and downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential.







Abstract
Fluorinated fused rings are challenging to construct from simple starting materials. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade reactions of readily available cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted olefins for the synthesis of fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. Two rings and three bonds were efficiently constructed in one reaction. The reaction showed broad substrate scope and the downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction. The mechanistic study supported the presence of cascade photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation processes.

         <title>Heteroatoms Induce Localization of the Electric Field and Promote a Wide Potential&#8208;Window Selectivity Towards CO in the CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin heteroatoms on a silver catalyst generate very strong and atomically localized electric fields, as disclosed by differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC&#8208;STEM). This results in a 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO at a wide range of potentials (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE).







Abstract
Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2RR) is a sustainable way of producing carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Product selectivity in CO2RR is regulated by the adsorption energy of reaction&#8208;intermediates. Here, we employ differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC&#8208;STEM) to demonstrate that Sn heteroatoms on a Ag catalyst generate very strong and atomically localized electric fields. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR) results verified that the localized electric field enhances the adsorption of *COOH, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR. The Ag/Sn catalyst exhibits an approximately 100&#8201;% CO selectivity at a very wide range of potentials (from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and with a remarkably high energy efficiency (EE) of 76.1&#8201;%.

         <title>Scalable Electrosynthesis of Formamide through C&#8722;N Coupling at the Industrially Relevant Current Density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2</title>

Boron&#8208;doped diamond catalyst is adopted for electrooxidation synthesis of formamide from methanol and ammonia with high activity and durability. A scale&#8208;up 8&#8197;L electrolyzer with an external renewable power supply for the production of formamide is designed to enable its scalable production (FE: 33.5&#8201;%, output: 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1), which shows the potential for the large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.







Abstract
The scalable and durable electrosynthesis of high&#8208;valued organonitrogen compounds from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules, especially operating at a high current density, is highly desirable. Here, a one&#8208;pot electrooxidation method to synthesize formamide (HCONH2) from methanol and ammonia over a commercial boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) catalyst is reported. The formamide selectivity from methanol and formamide Faradaic efficiency (FE
) achieve 73.2&#8201;% and 41.2&#8201;% at the current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with high durability. The C&#8722;N bond originates from the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on an aldehyde&#8208;like intermediate. Impressively, an 8&#8197;L electrolyzer is employed for the pilot plant test over a 2200&#8197;cm2 BDD electrode, which exhibits 33.5&#8201;% FE
 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (current: 264&#8197;A) with a yield rate of 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the potential of this technique for large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of formamide.

A scale-up 8&#8197;L electrolyzer with an external renewable power supply for the production of formamide is designed to enable its scalable production (FE: 33.5&#8201;%, output: 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which shows the potential for the large-scale electrosynthesis of formamide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scalable and durable electrosynthesis of high-valued organonitrogen compounds from carbon- and nitrogen-containing small molecules, especially operating at a high current density, is highly desirable. Here, a one-pot electrooxidation method to synthesize formamide (HCONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from methanol and ammonia over a commercial boron-doped diamond (BDD) catalyst is reported. The formamide selectivity from methanol and formamide Faradaic efficiency (FE
) achieve 73.2&#8201;% and 41.2&#8201;% at the current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with high durability. The C&#8722;N bond originates from the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on an aldehyde-like intermediate. Impressively, an 8&#8197;L electrolyzer is employed for the pilot plant test over a 2200&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; BDD electrode, which exhibits 33.5&#8201;% FE
 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (current: 264&#8197;A) with a yield rate of 36.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating the potential of this technique for large-scale electrosynthesis of formamide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silicon Catalyzed C&#8722;O Bond Ring Closing Metathesis of Polyethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane is applied in the selective catalytic C&#8722;O ring&#8208;closing metathesis of challenging oligo&#8208; and polyethers, enabling upcycling of polyethylene glycol. Based on detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism by DFT calculations, an improved second&#8208;generation silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid is developed.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane catalyzes C&#8722;O bond metathesis of alkyl ethers with an efficiency outperforming all earlier reported systems. Chemoselective ring contractions of macrocyclic crown ethers enable substrate&#8208;specific transformations, and an unprecedented ring&#8208;closing metathesis of polyethylene glycols allows polymer&#8208;selective degradation. Quantum chemical computations scrutinize a high Lewis acidity paired with a simultaneous low propensity for polydentate substrate binding as critical for successful catalysis. Based on these mechanistic insights, a second&#8208;generation class of silicon Lewis superacid with enhanced efficacy is identified and demonstrated.

         <title>Rapid and Economical Chemoselective Metabolomics Using Boronate Ester Formation on a Monolithic Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and economical chemoselective labeling strategy was established involving a boronate ester reaction on a monolithic substrate. Only 15&#8197;minutes is required to complete the strategy and boron allows for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive additional isotopic encoding. The sensitivity was enhanced up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry methods.







Abstract
Although chemoselective labeling strategies show great potential in in&#8208;depth description of metabolomics, the associated time and expense limit applications in high&#8208;throughput and routine analysis. We report a fast and effective chemoselective labeling strategy based on multifunctionalized monolithic probes. A rapid pH&#8208;responsive boronate ester reaction was employed to immobilize and release probe molecules from substrate in 5&#8197;min. The mesoporous surface and hierarchically porous channels of the substrate allowed for accelerated labeling reactions. Moreover, the discernible boron beacons allowed for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive isotopic encoding. This new strategy has been successfully used for submetabolome analysis of yeast cells, serum, and faeces samples, with improved sensitivity for short chain fatty acids up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) methods.

         <title>Bi&#8208;polaron Transport and Magnetic Field Induced Pauli Spin Blockade in Redox&#8208;Active Molecular Junctions</title>

         <dc:description>
The bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade were revealed in redox&#8208;active molecules in molecular junctions (MJs), as evidenced by the magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which may bring new magnetic&#8208;electronic functionality to molecular scale electronic devices.







Abstract
We report the bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade in solid&#8208;state molecular junctions (MJs) evidenced by a positive magnetoresistance (MR). The junction was made of thin layers of redox&#8208;active ruthenium polypyridyl&#8208;oligomers Ru(tpy)2 sandwiched between conducting amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) electrodes. The redox&#8208;active Ru(tpy)2 molecule, which enables small polaron and deep traps in the charge transport of the Ru(tpy)2 MJ as revealed by the temperature&#8208;dependent current&#8211;voltage response, leads to the formation of the bi&#8208;polaron and magnetic field induced Pauli spin blockade, resulting into the MR. At the meantime, the reliable and controllable device performance renders a rigid thickness&#8208;dependent MR evolution. The bi&#8208;polaron transport revealed in our study underscores the importance of the multi&#8208;particle transport by molecular design in MJs and laid the foundation for magnetic&#8208;electronic function in molecular&#8208;scale devices.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Regulated Conformational Change of Disulfide&#8208;Rich Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide bond formation is usually used in nature for the regulation and stabilization of protein conformations. This principle has now been expanded to control the conformational change of thiol&#8208;rich peptides into an amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, which undergoes a subsequent self&#8208;assembly to form a mechanically rigid hydrogel. Such a stimuli&#8208;responsive feature allows the biomedical application of such peptides.







Abstract
Disulfide bond formation is a common mechanism for regulating conformational changes in proteins during oxidative folding. Despite extensive studies of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to constrain peptide conformation, few studies have explored their usage in developing self&#8208;assembling peptides. Herein, we report that a thiol&#8208;rich peptide could fold into an amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation through the formation of two hetero&#8208;disulfide bonds upon oxidation, subsequently self&#8208;assembling into a mechanically rigid hydrogel. Breaking disulfide bonds under reductive condition, the hydrogel exhibited a transition from hydrogel to solution. Molecular simulation revealed that intermolecular interaction between two tryptophan residues was indispensable for hydrogelation. This work is the first case of the use of multiple disulfide bonds to control conformational change and self&#8208;assembly, and provides a cell&#8208;compatible hydrogel material for potential biomedical application.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV) Reveals Behaviorally Evoked Dopamine Release by Sugar Feeding in the Adult Drosophila Mushroom Body</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry was developed to measure behaviorally evoked dopamine release in the mushroom body of adult Drosophila melanogaster during sugar feeding. Sugar feeding stimulated robust dopamine release and its release was pharmacologically characterized. Dopamine release was increased after applying flupentixol and nisoxetine, demonstrating D2 receptors and dopamine transporters mediate sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine signaling.







Abstract
Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is an excellent model organism for studying dopaminergic mechanisms and simple behaviors, but methods to measure dopamine during behavior are needed. Here, we developed fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to track in vivo dopamine during sugar feeding. First, we employed acetylcholine stimulation to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo measurements in an awake fly. Next, we tested sugar feeding by placing sucrose solution near the fly proboscis. In the mushroom body medial tip, 1&#8197;pmol acetylcholine and sugar feeding released 0.49&#177;0.04&#8197;&#956;M and 0.31&#177;0.06&#8197;&#956;M dopamine, respectively but sugar&#8208;evoked release lasted longer than with acetylcholine. Administering the dopamine transporter inhibitor nisoxetine or D2 receptor antagonist flupentixol significantly increased sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine.

     alt="Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV) Reveals Behaviorally Evoked Dopamine Release by Sugar Feeding in the Adult Drosophila Mushroom Body"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was developed to measure behaviorally evoked dopamine release in the mushroom body of adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; during sugar feeding. Sugar feeding stimulated robust dopamine release and its release was pharmacologically characterized. Dopamine release was increased after applying flupentixol and nisoxetine, demonstrating D2 receptors and dopamine transporters mediate sugar-evoked dopamine signaling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, the fruit fly, is an excellent model organism for studying dopaminergic mechanisms and simple behaviors, but methods to measure dopamine during behavior are needed. Here, we developed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to track in vivo dopamine during sugar feeding. First, we employed acetylcholine stimulation to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo measurements in an awake fly. Next, we tested sugar feeding by placing sucrose solution near the fly proboscis. In the mushroom body medial tip, 1&#8197;pmol acetylcholine and sugar feeding released 0.49&#177;0.04&#8197;&#956;M and 0.31&#177;0.06&#8197;&#956;M dopamine, respectively but sugar-evoked release lasted longer than with acetylcholine. Administering the dopamine transporter inhibitor nisoxetine or D2 receptor antagonist flupentixol significantly increased sugar-evoked dopamine. This study develops FSCV to measure behaviorally evoked release in fly, enabling &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; studies of neurochemical control of reward, learning, and memory behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A novel dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel realizes stable and rechargeable solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries.







Abstract
As a key component of batteries, the electrolyte determines the ion transport and interface chemistry of the cathode and anode. In this work, we develop a dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel electrolyte composed of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA) and potassium iodide (KI) for solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries. The assembled hybrid battery shows excellent renewability and a long cycling life of 110&#8197;h with a high energy efficiency of 80&#8201;%. The ion&#8208;crosslinked dual&#8208;network structure endows the material with improved mechanical strength and increased ionic conductivity. More importantly, the introduction of iodine species not only offers more favorable cathodic kinetics of iodide/iodate redox than oxygen electrocatalysis but also regulates the solvation structure of zinc ions to ensure better interface stability. This work provides significant concepts for developing novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes to realize high&#8208;performance energy devices and technologies.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Bisindole Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers based on the de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol.







Abstract
N&#8722;N Atropisomers are a common motif in natural products and represent a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the catalytic atroposelective synthesis of such molecules remains challenging, hampering meaningful development. In particular, an enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers is unprecedented. Herein, the first enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were generated in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities via a cascade condensation/N&#8208;arylation reaction. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole, and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol. Moreover, investigations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the reaction mechanism and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Dramatically Enhanced Reactivity of Fullerenes and Tetrazine towards the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction inside a Porous Porphyrinic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 44, November 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions. Moreover, hydration&#8208;induced rearrangement of C60&#8208;LA inside Zn&#8208;PB facilitates its release from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity, thus enabling Zn&#8208;PB to catalyze fullerene&#8208;pyrazoline adduct formation without product inhibition.







Abstract
Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (IEDDA) between fullerenes and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine generally requires harsh conditions and long reaction times due to their strong electron&#8208;accepting nature. Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of the fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions by installing a tetrazine&#8208;based axle (LA) via metal&#8208;ligand coordination bond, which modulates the cavity size to facilitate the encapsulation of fullerenes. Upon encapsulation, the close proximity of fullerenes and the tetrazine group of LA dramatically increase their reactivity towards the IEDDA reaction to form fullerene&#8208;tetrazine adducts. Furthermore, the C60&#8208;tetrazine adduct is rearranged upon hydration to a bent&#8208;shaped C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct that can be released from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity in the presence of excess LA, thus catalyzing the formation of C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct inside Zn&#8208;PB without product inhibition.

         <title>Substrate Tumbling in a Chemisorbed Diastereomeric &#945;&#8208;Ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;Naphthyl)ethylamine Complex</title>

Guided by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and adsorption forces, an &#945;&#8208;ketoester tumbles between two prochiral states in a chemisorbed diastereomeric complex.







Abstract
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for &#945;&#8208;ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine complexes on Pt(111) reveal a tumbling motion that couples two neighboring binding states. The interconversion, resulting in prochiral inversion of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester, occurs in single complexes without breaking them apart. This is a surprising observation because the overall motion requires rotation of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester away from the surface without branching exclusively into diffusion away from the complex or desorption. The multi&#8208;step interconversion is rationalized in terms of sequences of bound states that combine transient H&#8208;bond interactions with the chiral molecule and weakened adsorption interactions with the metal. The observation of tumbling in single long&#8208;lived complexes is of relevance to self&#8208;assembly and directed molecular motion on surfaces, to ligand&#8208;controlled surface reactions, and most directly to stereocontrol in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>A Reactivity&#8208;Tunable Self&#8208;Immolative Design Enables Histone Deacetylase&#8208;Targeted Imaging and Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a reactivity&#8208;tunable self&#8208;immolative design that enables activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and HDAC&#8208;responsive prodrug release in vivo. Our design highlights the potential for HDAC&#8208;targeted cancer diagnosis and drug development.







Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#8208;targeted probes and prodrugs are crucial for cancer theranostics. We developed a self&#8208;immolative design that enables in vivo activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and prodrug release in response to HDAC. This design comprises a phenyl ester linker with tunable reactivity, facilitating efficient release of caged fluorophores/drugs upon deacetylation. We engineered a new fluorophore using a spirocyclic xanthene scaffold with ring&#8208;open property, affording NIRF/PA detection with high contrast. We showed that a nitro&#8208;substituted self&#8208;immolative linker allows sensitive NIRF/PA in vivo imaging of HDAC with minimal interference. A highly efficient prodrug system was further developed for targeted therapy in HDAC&#8208;overexpressed triple negative breast tumors in mice. Our study provides a valuable paradigm for HDAC&#8208;targeted NIRF/PA imaging and prodrug release in vivo, highlighting its potential for bioimaging and drug development.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed PIDA&#8208;Mediated &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Acetoxylation of Amino Acid Derivatives: Overriding Competitive Intramolecular Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of amino acid derivatives has been achieved by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The N&#8208;SO2Py protecting/directing group plays a key role in enabling control of chemoselectivity (intermolecular C&#8722;O over intramolecular C&#8722;N bond formation) and regioselectivity (favoring &#948;&#8208;CH3 over &#947;&#8208;CH2 activation).







Abstract
The selective &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acetoxylation of N&#8208;(SO2Py)&#8208;protected amino acid derivatives has been accomplished by using palladium&#8208;catalysis and PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) as both terminal oxidant and acetoxy source. The distinct structural and electronic features of the SO2Py compared to more traditional carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups is essential to override the otherwise more favourable competitive intramolecular C&#8722;H amination. The &#948;&#8208;site selectivity predominates over traditionally more favorable 5&#8208;membered cyclopalladation at competitive &#947;&#8208;CH2. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies provide important insights about the mechanism and the underlying factors controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spectral tuning&#8212;from green to red&#8212;of luciferase&#8208;free luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was demonstrated by means of electrolyte engineering. The color change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and brings evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state by double layer electric fields. Visual mapping of ECL and fluorescence fronts enables the optical quantitation of superoxide and oxyluciferin diffusivities.







Abstract
Luciferin is one of Nature's most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to promote firefly's luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst&#8212;luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin's electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Benzylation with Photogenerated Hydroxy&#8208;o&#8208;Quinodimethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation with 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone derivatives under light irradiation is described. The corresponding nucleophilic photoenols generated under light irradiation, enabled the reaction to take place in reasonable yields (up to 77&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, without the need for strong bases, or pre&#8208;decoration of the substrates.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic benzylation of aryl vinyl carbinols under light irradiation is described. 2&#8208;Methylbenzophenone derivatives are employed and activated to hydroxy&#8208;o&#8208;quinodimethanes by an ultraviolet (UV) light. This approach enables asymmetric allylic benzylation with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from readily available 2&#8208;methylbenzophenones without the utilization of strong bases, and pre&#8208;activation or pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrates. Moreover, deuterium experiments reveal the generation of nucleophilic benzyl species from 2&#8208;methylbenzophenone under UV irradiation.

         <title>Siloxane&#8208;Based Organosilicon Materials in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane&#8208;based organosilicon materials enable important new functions, such as a wide electrochemical window, resistance to extreme temperatures, long cycling life in energy storage systems, high thermostability, fireproof and flexibility. Such materials have been integrated in electrodes, separators and electrolyte interfaces for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors.







Abstract
Siloxane&#8208;based molecular material, by virtue of its unique chemical structure, thermal and electrochemical properties, has triggered tremendous research interest and sparked a revolution for energy storage in the past years. Siloxanes and their analogues are generally demonstrated to be more environmentally friendly, durable, and safer when employed to reconstruct the nano&#8208;micro surface structure of electrodes, separators, and their interfaces with electrolytes. To better understand the recent and comprehensive achievement of siloxane&#8208;based materials in energy storage, a systematic summary is necessary to provide important clues, aiming at achieving better electrochemical properties. In this Minireview, siloxane materials are presented comprehensively and systematically in terms of molecule design, functionality, and unique superiority for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors. The challenges, perspectives, and future directions of siloxane&#8208;based organosilicon materials are put forward for higher performance and wider application in electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Directed Conformational Switching of a Zinc Finger Analogue Regulates the Mechanosensing and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational switching of rationally designed secondary&#8208;structure mimics of extracellular matrix proteins can be controlled via the formation a polymer&#8211;cation complex enabling the control of bio&#8208;ligand presentation for the study of cellular development.







Abstract
The dynamic conformational changes in the secondary structures of proteins are essential to their functions and can regulate diverse cellular events. Herein we report the design of a synthetic polymer&#8208;based secondary structure analogue of a zinc finger (ZnF) by introducing a zinc coordination motif to overcome the free energy barrier predicted by theoretical calculations and fold&#8208;free polymer chains. The conformational switching between unfolded and folded state of the ZnF analogue can be triggered in situ to drastically manipulate the accessibility of conjugated cell adhesive ligands to the cell membrane receptors, thereby effectively controlling the adhesion, spreading, mechanosensing, and differentiation of stem cells. We believe that emulating the dynamic secondary structures of proteins via rational design of a folded synthetic polymer&#8211;cation complex is a promising strategy for developing bioactive materials to mediate desired cellular functions.

         <title>Squarephaneic Tetraanhydride: A Conjugated Square&#8208;Shaped Cyclophane for the Synthesis of Porous Organic Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique new member of the family of aromatic carboxylic anhydride building blocks&#8212;a conjugated square&#8208;shaped cyclophane with four anhydride groups&#8212;is presented. The building block can be obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis and functionalised efficiently to give materials with highly interesting properties ranging from high degrees of porosity to excellent electrochemical properties, as shown by the conversion into imides and carboxylates.







Abstract
Aromatic carboxylic anhydrides are ubiquitous building blocks in organic materials chemistry and have received considerable attention in the synthesis of organic semiconductors, pigments, and battery electrode materials. Here we extend the family of aromatic carboxylic anhydrides with a unique new member, a conjugated cyclophane with four anhydride groups. The cyclophane is obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis and can be functionalised efficiently, as shown by the conversion into tetraimides and an octacarboxylate. Crystal structures reveal the high degree of porosity achievable with the new building block. Excellent electrochemical properties and reversible reduction to the tetraanions are shown for the imides; NMR and EPR measurements confirm the global aromaticity of the dianions and evidence the global Baird aromaticity of the tetraanions. Considering the short synthesis and unique properties, we expect widespread use of the new building block in the development of organic materials.

         <title>A Broadband, Multiplexed&#8208;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Transport in Composite Flexible&#8208;Organic&#8208;Crystal Waveguide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical integration of three optically different flexible crystal waveguides produces a compact organic wavelength division multiplexer (WDM). This WDM merges three narrow&#8208;band optical signals (blue, cyan, and yellow) to transmit a broadband visible light signal. Such wide bandwidth signal multiplexers open the doors to visible light communication (VLC) technologies.







Abstract
We report the construction of an organic crystal multiplexer using three chemically and optically different acicular, flexible organic crystals for a broadband, visible light signal transportation. The mechanical integration of a highly flexible crystal waveguide of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(7&#8208;methoxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acrylonitrile (BTD2CF3) displaying bright yellow (&#955;1) fluorescence with blue&#8208;emitting (&#955;2) BPP and cyan emitting (&#955;3) DBA crystals using AFM&#8208;tip provides a composite organic crystal multiplexer. The constructed hybrid single crystal multiplexer effectively transduces three optical signals (&#955;1+&#955;2+&#955;3) covering the 420&#8211;750&#8197;nm region as a composite output signal. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiment demonstrates the real potential of organic flexible crystal waveguides for visible light communication technologies.

         <title>Electronic Materials: An Antiaromatic Propeller Made from the Four&#8208;Fold Fusion of Tetraoxa[8]circulene and Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annelating the antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene with four perylenediimide units yields an intensely absorbing and emissive charge&#8208;transfer molecule. The aromatic/antiaromatic character of neutral and charged species and the incorporation in bulk hetero junction solar cell (power conversion efficiency of 6.4&#8201;%) is described.







Abstract
The synthesis of an antiaromatic tetraoxa[8]circulene annulated with four perylene diimides (PDI), giving a dynamic non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, is described. The molecule contains 32 aromatic rings surrounding one formally antiaromatic planarized cyclooctatetraene (COT). The intense absorption (&#1013;=3.35&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in CH2Cl2) and emission bands are assigned to internal charge&#8208;transfer transitions in the combined PDI&#8208;circulene &#960;&#8208;system. The spectroscopic data is supported by density functional theory calculations, and nuclear independent chemical shift calculation indicate that the antiaromatic COT has increased aromaticity in the reduced state. Electrochemical studies show that the compound can reversibly reach the tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;anionic states by reduction of the four PDI units, and the deca&#8208;anionic state by reduction of the central COT ring. The material functions effectively in bulk hetero junction solar cells as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, reaching a power conversion efficiency of 6.4&#8201;%.

         <title>PNP Ligands in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Activation and Functionalization of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White phosphorus (P4) can be activated in the coordination sphere of cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of N,N bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand gives a P4 transformation into a zig&#8208;zag chain which can readily be functionalized by Ph2P groups to form a complex containing a unique P9&#8208;ligand. The presence of an organic substituent at the nitrogen atom in the PNP ligand gives complexes with an &#951;1&#8208;coordinated P4 molecule.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal mediated white phosphorus activation is of high interest as an ecological alternative to P4 chlorination pathway to the practically useful phosphorus products. Herein, we report a facile approach for P4 activation, transformation and subsequent functionalization using cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of N,N&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand allows one to transform P4 tetrahedron into a zig&#8208;zag chain with the formation of complex [Co(Ph2PNHP(Ph2)PPPPP(Ph2)NHPPh2)]BF4 (4). The presence of organic substituent at nitrogen atom in PNP ligand enables one to obtain complexes with &#951;1&#8208;coordinated P4 molecule, which indicates a crucial role of N&#8722;H bond in transformation of white phosphorus tetrahedron. Additionally, complex 4 can readily be functionalized by means of the reaction with Ph2PCl leading to the formation of a new complex bearing unique P9&#8208;ligand. The obtained results provide opportunities for facile construction of new polyphosphorus ligands in the coordination sphere of transition metal complexes.

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy of hydrated proton complexes in solution provides compelling evidence of the pronounced impact on the electronic structure of the water molecules participating in the hydration, with a hierarchy in coupling strengths of the proton with profoundly strong orbital interactions for the inner three water molecules, and Coulombic field effects of the proton positive charge with the first hydration shell water molecules.







Abstract
Seemingly simple yet surprisingly difficult to probe, excess protons in water constitute complex quantum objects with strong interactions with the extended and dynamically changing hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of the liquid. Proton hydration plays pivotal roles in energy transport in hydrogen fuel cells and signal transduction in transmembrane proteins. While geometries and stoichiometry have been widely addressed in both experiment and theory, the electronic structure of these specific hydrated proton complexes has remained elusive. Here we show, layer by layer, how utilizing novel flatjet technology for accurate x&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements and combining infrared spectral analysis and calculations, we find orbital&#8208;specific markers that distinguish two main electronic&#8208;structure effects: Local orbital interactions determine covalent bonding between the proton and neigbouring water molecules, while orbital&#8208;energy shifts measure the strength of the extended electric field of the proton.

         <title>Removal and Degradation of Microplastics Using the Magnetic and Nanozyme Activities of Bare Iron Oxide Nanoaggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates efficiently adsorb to a variety of common microplastics via hydrogen bonding, allowing full magnetic removal at 1&#8201;% of plastic weight, and complete microplastic degradation due to its nanozyme activity at high temperatures.







Abstract
Removal and degradation of microplastics are often carried out separately. In this work, hydrophilic bare Fe3O4 nanoaggregates allowed efficient removal of the most common microplastics including high&#8208;density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Full extraction was achieved using Fe3O4 at 1&#8201;% of the mass of microplastics. Hydrogen bonding is the main force for the adsorption of Fe3O4. Unlike the more commonly used hydrophobically modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the bare Fe3O4 benefitted from the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of its exposed surface, enabling further catalytic degradation of microplastics with nearly 100&#8201;% efficiency and easy recovery of the Fe3O4.

         <title>The Role of Heme Peroxo Oxidants in the Rational Mechanistic Modeling of Nitric Oxide Synthase: Characterization of Key Intermediates and Elucidation of the Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mid&#8208;valent heme peroxo mimics have been evaluated in the modeling of a pathogenically significant enzyme, nitric oxide synthase. The key mechanistic details closely resemble one of the most widely reproduced enzymatic proposals. In&#8208;detail characterization of reaction intermediates is presented, and the overall mechanism is elucidated.







Abstract
Mammalian nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mediates the two&#8208;step O2&#8208;dependent oxidative degradation of arginine, and has been linked to a medley of disease situations in humans. Nonetheless, its exact mechanism of action still remains unclear. This work presents the first NOS model system where biologically proposed heme superoxo and peroxo intermediates are assessed as active oxidants against oxime substrates. Markedly, heme peroxo intermediates engaged in a bioinspired oxime oxidation reaction pathway, converting oximes to ketones and nitroxyl anions (NO&#8722;). Detailed thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations all evince a rate&#8208;limiting step primarily driven by the nucleophilicity of the heme peroxo moiety. Coherent with other findings, 18O and 15N isotope substitution experiments herein suffice compelling evidence toward a detailed mechanism, which draw close parallels to one of the enzymatic proposals. Intriguingly, recent enzymatic studies also lend credence to these findings, and several relevant reaction intermediates have been observed during NOS turnover.

         <title>Biosynthetic Elucidation and Structural Revision of Brevione&#8197;E: Characterization of the Key Dioxygenase for Pathway Branching from Setosusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthetic elucidation and structural revision of the fungal meroterpenoid brevione&#8197;E were achieved. The brevione&#8197;E pathway involves dihydrotropone synthesis via the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is also the key enzyme responsible for the pathway branching from setosusin biosynthesis, which involves a BrvJ homologue, SetK. Amino acid residues that account for their product selectivity were also identified.







Abstract
Brevione&#8197;E (1) is a fungal hexacyclic meroditerpenoid with unique oxepane and cycloheptenone moieties. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Surprisingly, reexamination of the structure of 1 revealed a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring instead of the previously proposed oxepane system. Moreover, we determined that cycloheptenone synthesis involves skeletal rearrangement catalyzed by the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is highly homologous to SetK, which engages in the biosynthesis of another fungal metabolite, setosusin, and accepts the same substrate as BrvJ but performs only simple hydroxylation. Finally, we identified the key amino acid residues critical for product selectivity of BrvJ and SetK, providing insight into how the biosynthesis pathways of 1 and setosusin diverge and how fungi diversify natural products.

         <title>Cross &#946; Amyloid Nanotubes Demonstrate Promiscuous Catalysis in a Chemical Reaction Network via Co&#8208;option</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promiscuous competencies of cross &#946; nanotubes were shown towards a reaction network with three orthogonal transformations that are connected via co&#8208;option, underpinning the important roles of short amyloids as earliest enzymatic folds.







Abstract
In Darwin's warm pond rich with nutrients, lesser number of early catalytic machineries with modest capabilities were able to demonstrate promiscuity by catalyzing diverse biochemical transformations important for protometabolism. Herein, we report catalytically promiscuous amyloid&#8208;based short peptide assemblies that could concomitantly catalyse three metabolically important yet orthogonal reactions. The surface exposed catalytic dyads featuring lysines and imidazoles were utilized for C=N condensation via dynamic covalent linkages and modulation of protonation events, respectively. Further, the peptide assemblies could promiscuously catalyse hydrolysis as well as retro&#8208;aldol reactions, that could be co&#8208;opted to facilitate C=N bond formation, either by a feedforward&#8208;driven reaction network or by replenishing depleted substrates. The catalytic diversity of short peptide based promiscuous &#946;&#8208;sheet folds suggests their possible role in promoting the protometabolic network in early earth.

         <title>Highly Stable Orange&#8208;Red Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent CsCdCl3:Mn2+ Perovskite Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite luminescent crystals with tunable afterglow time, high efficiency and stability were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn2+ shows the longest afterglow time of 1480&#8197;s and the highest PLQY of 91.4&#8201;%. CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn2+ maintained over 90&#8201;% of the PL intensity at 423&#8197;K, and the PL remains about 80&#8201;% after soaking in water for 55&#8197;days.







Abstract
Halide perovskite has been widely studied as a new generation of photoelectronic materials. However, their thermal and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a hexagonal Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite crystal that possesses stable photoluminescence (PL) at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of the single crystals lasts up to 1480&#8197;s and can be adjusted by changing the concentration of Mn2+ ion doping. The characteristic emission of d&#8208;d transition of Mn2+ is realized, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 91.4&#8201;%, it can maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial PL spectral integral area at 150&#8201;&#176;C (423&#8197;K). High humid stability PL can be achieved more than 75&#8201;% of the initial PL intensity after 55&#8197;days of immersion in water. These excellent properties show the application prospect of the LPL material in lighting indication and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Taming Heavier Group 14 Imine Analogues: Accessing Tin Nitrogen [Sn=N] Double Bonds and their Cycloaddition/Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study on taming stannaimines (R2Sn=NR) is reported by identifying a suitable supporting ligand framework for stannylenes in combination with organic azides. The nitrogen substituent of these compounds was crucial for allowing a broad range of subsequent reactivity ranging from cycloadditions to multiple bond metathesis reactions, thus highlighting the necessary balance of rendering challenging systems isolable but still reactive.







Abstract
A systematic study to access stable stannaimines is reported, by combining different heteroleptic stannylenes with a range of organic azides. The reactions of terphenyl&#8208;/hypersilyl&#8208;substituted stannylenes yield the putative tin nitrogen double bond, but is directly followed by 1,2&#8208;silyl migration to give SnII systems featuring bulky silylamido ligands. By contrast, the transition from a two &#963; donor ligand set to a mixed &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;donor scaffold allows access to three new stannaimines which can be handled at room temperature. The reactivity profile of these Sn=N bonded species is crucially dependent on the substituent at the nitrogen atom. As such, the Sn=NMes (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) system is capable of activating a broad range of substrates under ambient conditions via 1,2&#8208;addition reactions, [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Most interestingly, very rare examples of main group multiple bond metathesis reactions are also found to be viable.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Anilines with Aromatic Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of anilines with non&#8208;activated aryl halides has been achieved by a metalla&#8208;tautomerism approach. The reactivity of an aniline towards a palladium catalyst was relayed from the NH group into the aromatic ring. Out of four possible positions, the catalytic arylation was directed exclusively into the para&#8208;C&#8722;H position by a bulky ligand at the palladium in combination with a temporarily installed shielding group.







Abstract
Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8722;H functionalizations is a key challenge in chemical method development. In arenes, functionalizations are most difficult to direct towards the C&#8722;H group furthest away from a substituent, in its para position. We herein demonstrate how the para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of anilines with non&#8208;activated aryl halides, elusive to date, is achieved by a base&#8208;assisted &#8220;metalla&#8208;tautomerism&#8221; approach. A proton is abstracted from the aniline substrate and replaced by an arylpalladium species, generated from the aryl halide coupling partner. In this step, the palladium is directed away from the N&#8208; to the tautomeric para&#8208;C&#8722;H position by a large phosphine ligand combined with a triphenylmethyl shielding group. The triphenylmethyl group is easily installed and removed, and can be recycled.

         <title>The Elusive Mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] Cluster in Three Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the synthesis and characterization of a three&#8208;member redox series (n=0, 1, 2) of mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters that model proposed intermediates in biological NO sensing. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational analysis indicates a local {Fe&#8722;NO}7 configuration regardless of the charge state, with a high&#8208;spin Fe3+ antiferromagnetically coupled to 3[NO]&#8722;.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are well&#8208;established targets in biological nitric oxide (NO) chemistry, but the key intermediate in these processes&#8212;a mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] cluster&#8212;has not been fully characterized in a protein or a synthetic model thereof. Here, we report the synthesis of a three&#8208;member redox series of isostructural mononitrosylated [Fe4S4] clusters. Mononitrosylation was achieved by binding NO to a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 site&#8208;differentiated [Fe4S4]+ cluster; subsequent oxidation and reduction afforded the other members of the series. All three clusters feature a local high&#8208;spin Fe3+ center antiferromagnetically coupled to 3[NO]&#8722;. The observation of an anionic NO ligand suggests that NO binding is accompanied by formal electron transfer from the cluster to NO. Preliminary reactivity studies with the monocationic cluster demonstrate that exposure to excess NO degrades the cluster, supporting the intermediacy of mononitrosylated intermediates in NO sensing/signaling.

         <title>Switchable Metal Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MFM&#8208;300(Sc): Lewis Acid Catalysis Driven by Metal&#8211;Hemilabile Linker Bond Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional catalytic activity was demonstrated for the Strecker reaction using a saturated ScIII&#8208;based MOF known as MFM&#8208;300(Sc). This activity was possible due to metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond to create an intermittent free ScIII site.







Abstract
Uncommon reversible guest&#8208;induced metal&#8208;hemilabile linker bond dynamics in MOF MFM&#8208;300(Sc) was unraveled to switch on/switch off catalytic open metal sites. The catalytic activity of this MOF with non&#8208;permanent open metal sites was demonstrated using a model Strecker hydrocyanation reaction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Conclusively, the catalytic activity was evidenced to be fully reversible, preserving the conversion performance and structure integrity of MFM&#8208;300(Sc) over multiple cycles. These experimental findings were corroborated by quantum&#8208;calculations that revealed a reaction mechanism driven by the Sc&#8208;open metal sites. This discovery paves the way towards the design of new effective and easily regenerable heterogeneous MOF catalysts integrating switchable metal sites.

         <title>Gradient Heating Epitaxial Growth Gives Well Lattice&#8208;Matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N Heterointerfaces that Boost Both Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N was formed by a gradient heating epitaxial growth method. The unique heterointerface promotes hydrogen evolution kinetics in both acid and alkaline media by generating near&#8208;zero hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy and facilitating water dissociation. As a result, electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance in pH&#8208;universal media is achieved that is comparable to commercial Pt/C.







Abstract
An optimized approach to producing lattice&#8208;matched heterointerfaces for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution has not yet been reported. Herein, we present the synthesis of lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructures using a gradient heating epitaxial growth method. The well lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface of Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N generates near&#8208;zero hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy and facilitates water dissociation in acid and alkaline media. The lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructures have low overpotentials of 73&#8197;mV and 80&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively, comparable to commercial Pt/C. A novel photothermal&#8208;electrocatalytic water vapor splitting device using the lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8722;Mo2N heterostructure as a hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst displays a competitive cell voltage for electrocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Efficient Splitting of Alkane Isomers by a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Auxetic Reentrant Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient gasoline upgrading with a research octane number (RON) higher than 96 was achieved in a reentrant auxetic honeycomb&#8208;like bismuth&#8208;based MOF with a combined fitting of pore window and chemistry. It enables the unprecedented exclusion of di&#8208;branched isomers and molecular discrimination of linear and mono&#8208;branched alkanes.







Abstract
The isolation of di&#8208;branched alkanes from their isomers is vital in gasoline upgrading to achieve high octane numbers but is significantly challenging and energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of hexane isomers by combing molecular recognition and size&#8208;sieving in a bismuth&#8208;based MOF, UU&#8208;200. The unique auxetic structure with reentrant honeycomb&#8208;like pore cavities connected by narrow pore windows endows UU&#8208;200 with a complete rejection of di&#8208;branched alkanes and high capacities for linear and mono&#8208;branched isomers. The molecular sieving effect, unprecedented separation selectivities, and excellent efficiencies are proved via adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments with high research octane numbers obtained (&gt;96), indicating a benchmark for alkane separation under ambient conditions. The molecular recognition mechanism was unveiled by theoretical simulation and in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy.

The molecular sieving effect, unprecedented separation selectivities, and excellent efficiencies are proved via adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments with high research octane numbers obtained (&amp;gt;96), indicating a benchmark for alkane separation under ambient conditions. The molecular recognition mechanism was unveiled by theoretical simulation and in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase In Vitro Maturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of an active [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (HydA), the most efficient enzyme for H2 production, requires the synthesis of a complex organometallic metal center, the H&#8208;cluster, where the reversible reduction of protons to H2 occurs. In vitro HydA maturation systems involving the three maturation proteins HydE, HydF and HydG have contributed significantly to a better understanding of the activation mechanism of this fascinating enzyme.







Abstract
The [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase H&#8208;cluster is a complex organometallic cofactor whose assembly and installation requires three dedicated accessory proteins referred to as HydE, HydF, and HydG. The roles of these maturases and the precise mechanisms by which they synthesize and insert the H&#8208;cluster are not fully understood. This Minireview will focus on new insights into the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase maturation process that have been provided by in vitro approaches in which the biosynthetic pathway has been partially or fully reconstructed using semisynthetic and enzyme&#8208;based approaches. Specifically, the application of these in vitro, semisynthetic, and fully defined approaches has shed light on the roles of individual maturation enzymes, the nature of H&#8208;cluster assembly intermediates, the molecular precursors of H&#8208;cluster ligands, and the sequence of steps involved in [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase maturation.

         <title>Dual Activation of Molecular Oxygen and Surface Lattice Oxygen in Single Atom Cu1/TiO2 Catalyst for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated Cu1+ on Cu1/TiO2 single atom catalysts (SACs) facilitated the simultaneously activation of chemisorbed O2 and 2&#8208;coordinated surface lattice O2&#8722;, which triggered the CO oxidation through E&#8208;R (80&#8201;&#176;C) and MvK (200&#8201;&#176;C) routes synergistically with elevated temperature. This finding will definitely provide insights and strategy for the rational design of efficient oxidation catalysts with sufficient reactive oxygen species for practical application.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth mechanism on the simultaneous activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722; on one active metallic site has not been elucidated yet. Herein, we report a strategy for the construction of abundant oxygen activation sites by rational design of Cu1/TiO2 single atom catalysts (SACs). The charge transfer between isolated Cu and TiO2 support generates abundant CuI and 2&#8208;coordinated Olat sites in Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti hybridization structure, which facilitates the chemisorption and activation of O2 molecules. Simultaneously, the Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti induced TiO2 lattice distortion activate the adjacent surface lattice O2&#8722;, achieving the dual activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722;. The Cu1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti active site switches the CO oxidation mechanism from Eley&#8208;Rideal (80&#8201;&#176;C) to Mars&#8211;van Krevelen route (200&#8201;&#176;C) with the increase of reaction temperature. The dual activation of O2 and surface lattice O2&#8722; can by modulating the electron properties of SACs can boost the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation activity.

         <title>Condensed Osmaquinolines with NIR&#8208;II Absorption Synthesized by Aryl C&#8722;H Annulation and Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of condensed metallaquinolines capable of NIR&#8208;II absorption involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling through the combined effects of Ag and Os. This work demonstrates an unusual reactivity pattern of anthranil and contributes a new approach to N&#8208;doped condensed metallacycles. It also illustrates a new cyclic d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; conjugation strategy for design NIR&#8208;II absorbing molecules.







Abstract
The structural design and tuning of properties of metallaaromatics are crucial in materials and energy science. Herein, we describe the rapid synthesis of tetracyclic metallaaromatics containing quinoline and pentalene motifs fused by a metal&#8208;bridged fragment. These unique compounds display remarkably broad absorption, enabling for the first time the absorption of metallaaromatics to reach the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) bio&#8208;window. The formation of osmaquinoline unit involves an unconventional C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling promoted by AgBF4 to achieve [3+3] cycloaddition. The introduction of cyclic d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; conjugation and extension of the aromatic &#960;&#8208;framework can effectively shrink the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, thus broadening the absorption window. The considerable photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) in both the NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II windows, the high photothermal stability and the excellent electrochemical behavior suggest many potential applications of these condensed metallaquinolines.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Phase Engineering and Phosphorus Doping on Ru/P&#8208;TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium cluster anchored on a lightly P&#8208;doped defective TiO2 catalyst was designed for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. The surface oxygen vacancies enhanced water dissociation and P&#8208;doping facilitated the H2 generation by enabling hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.







Abstract
Synergistic optimization of the elementary steps of water dissociation and hydrogen desorption for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is a challenge. Herein, the Ru cluster anchored on a trace P&#8208;doped defective TiO2 substrate (Ru/P&#8208;TiO2) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for the HER; it exhibited a commercial Pt/C&#8208;like geometric activity and an excellent mass activity of 9984.3&#8197;mA&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.05&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is 34.3 and 18.7 times higher than that of Pt/C and Ru/TiO2, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies indicated that using a rutile&#8208;TiO2&#8208;crystal&#8208;phase substrate enhanced the HER activity more than the anatase phase. Rich surface oxygen vacancies on rutile&#8208;TiO2 facilitated the adsorption and dissociation of water, while the partial substitution of Ti4+ with P5+ enhanced H2 generation by facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Ru site to the surface P site, synergistically enhancing the HER activity.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation and Tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation of [1.1.1]Propellane: Reactivity and Structural Insight
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging SF5 and Ar&#8722;SF4 chemistry with strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane enables us to explore uncharted chemical space associated with C(sp3)&#8722;SF5 and C(sp3)&#8722;SF4Ar motifs. X&#8208;ray analyses of the resultant &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; reveal remarkably short transannular nonbonding C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C contacts&#8212;among the shortest distances reported to date. DFT and SC&#8208;XRD data provide evidence that the wing C&#8722;C bonds play a key role in stabilization.

We leveraged the recent increase in synthetic accessibility of SF5Cl and Ar&#8722;SF4Cl compounds to combine chemistry of the SF5 and SF4Ar groups with strain&#8208;release functionalization. By effectively adding SF5 and SF4Ar radicals across [1.1.1]propellane, we accessed structurally unique bicyclopentanes, bearing two distinct elements of bioisosterism. Upon evaluating these &#8220;hybrid isostere&#8221; motifs in the solid state, we measured exceptionally short transannular distances; in one case, the distance rivals the shortest nonbonding C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C contact reported to date. This prompted SC&#8208;XRD and DFT analyses that support the notion that a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction involving the &#8220;wing&#8221; C&#8722;C bonds is playing an important role in stabilization. Thus, these heretofore unknown structures expand the palette for highly coveted three&#8208;dimensional fluorinated building blocks and provide insight to a more general effect observed in bicyclopentanes.

         <title>A Missing Link in Multisubstituted Pyrrolidines: Remote Stereocontrol Forged by Rhodium&#8208;Alkyl Nitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the importance of pyrrolidines in drug discovery together with the dearth of methods for synthesizing multisubstituted heterocycles with nonadjacent stereocenters, we report the stereoselective synthesis of remotely decorated, trisubstituted &#946;&#8208;prolines via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination. The present protocol addresses the prevalent limitations associated with substituted pyrrolidines.







Abstract
Pyrrolidines are significant N&#8208;heterocycles in medicinal chemistry and are among the top ten ring systems found in drug molecules. While simple derivatives are commercially available, densely decorated derivatives with precise stereochemical arrangements remain difficult to obtain. Methods for synthesizing multisubstituted pyrrolidines with nonadjacent stereocenters are particularly scarce. To bridge this gap, we report the stereoselective synthesis of remotely decorated, trisubstituted &#946;&#8208;prolines via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination. The transformation proceeds well in the presence of various functionalities with exclusive anti&#8208;selectivity. Carboxylic acids in the products serve as gateways for diverse downstream transformations. Furthermore, the combined experimental and computational study sheds lights on the origin of high diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety.

Abstract
Both aryne 1,4&#8208;disubstitution and 1,2,4&#8208;trifunctionalization were accomplished from tertiary amines bearing a penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety. These transformations could directly incorporate a C&#8722;N and a C&#8722;C bond para to each other on an aryne intermediate via a sequential nucleophilic addition and [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. When arynes bearing 3&#8208;tethered electrophiles were employed, a cascade regioselective nucleophilic addition, intramolecular cyclization, and remote diastereoselective [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement process was observed. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between two C&#8722;H hydrogens on the penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl chain and the oxygen anion generated upon N&#8208;nucleophilic annulation reaction in the [5,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement step is responsible for the remote diastereoselective control in this reaction system.

The 10H,10&#8242;H&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[acridine] core to include moieties featuring two non&#8208;equivalent N&#8208;substituted&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine subunits with different structural and electronic characteristics were desiged as HTMs of PSCs. The planar 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole units based HTM (BSA50) not only exhibits better electronic properties, but also results in better passivating capability for the perovskite trap states via stronger donor ability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) based on the 10H, 10&#8242;H&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi [acridine] core (BSA50 and BSA51) were synthesized, and their electronic properties were explored. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the presence of rigid 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in BSA 50 brings about improved hole mobility and higher work function compared to bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine units in BSA51, which increase interfacial hole transportation from perovskite to HTM. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on BSA50 boost power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 22.65&#8201;%, and a PSC module using BSA50 HTM exhibits a PCE of 21.35&#8201;% (6.5&#215;7&#8197;cm) with a Voc of 8.761&#8197;V and FF of 79.1&#8201;%. The unencapsulated PSCs exhibit superior stability to devices employing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, retaining nearly 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h operation output. This work demonstrates the high potential of molecularly engineered spirobi[acridine] derivatives as HTMs as replacements for spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.

         <title>Local Proton Source Enhanced Nitrogen Reduction on a Combined Cobalt&#8208;Molybdenum Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The appropriate amount of water adsorbed on the surface of Co&#8722;Mo co&#8208;embedded carbon nanofibers facilitated the formation of N&#8722;H bonds and promoted the protonation step of nitrogen reduction via proton source transfer from the water dissociation, which was confirmed by the results of in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy experiments and isotopic labeling experiments using D2O and 15N2.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted considerable scientific and engineering interest as a green alternative route for NH3 production. Molybdenum is a promising candidate as an electrocatalyst for NRR as it has a suitable binding strength with N species. However, the design of an efficient Mo&#8208;based catalyst remains elusive. To enhance the selectivity of NRR toward NH3, we have developed a carbon nanofiber catalyst embedded with molybdenum and cobalt (Co&#8722;Mo&#8722;CNF). Co with a strong ability to dissociate water enhances local proton source near Mo, where the hydrogenation step of the NRR occurs. A NH3 formation rate of 72.72&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 34.5&#8201;% were obtained at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. We also attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of the NRR via in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotopic labeling experiments using 15N2 and D2O.

A NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formation rate of 72.72&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faradaic efficiency of 34.5&#8201;% were obtained at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. We also attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of the NRR via in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and isotopic labeling experiments using &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Gold Alloy Catalyzes the Aerobic Oxidation of Formic Acid for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the catalytic mechanism of formate oxidase, a platinum&#8208;gold alloy simulating the catalytic function of formic acid oxidase was designed. Hydrogen peroxide can directly synthesized by aerobic oxidation of formic acid without complex equipment and an additional energy supply.







Abstract
On&#8208;site hydrogen peroxide production through electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions has recently attracted broad research interest. However, practical applications have thus far been plagued by the low activity and the requirement of complex equipment. Here, inspired by the process of biological hydrogen peroxide synthesis catalyzed by enzymes, we report a Pt&#8208;Au alloy to mimic the catalytic function of natural formate oxidase for hydrogen peroxide synthesis through aerobic oxidation of formic acid. The mass activity of the Pt&#8208;Au alloy is three times higher than that of formate oxidase. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the efficient dehydrogenation of formic acid and the high selectivity of the subsequent reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide account for the high hydrogen peroxide productivity. In addition, the formic acid aqueous solution provides an acidic environment, which is conducive to the utilization of the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide for oxidation reactions, including C&#8722;H bond oxidation and sterilization.

         <title>Reply to Correspondence on &#8220;Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase&#8221;</title>

Abstract
Manley and co&#8208;workers provide data demonstrating that, at super&#8208;pharmacological concentrations (300&#8197;&#956;M), a ternary complex between Abl, asciminib, and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors is possible. The work in our manuscript concerns the interplay of asciminib (and GNF&#8208;2) with ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (Cmax=1.6&#8211;3.7&#8197;&#956;M for asciminib). Manley and co&#8208;workers do not question any of the studies that we reported, nor do they provide explanations for how our work fits into their preferred model. Herein, we consider the data presented by Manley and co&#8208;workers. In addition, we provide new data supporting the findings in our Communication. Asciminib and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors do not simultaneously bind Abl at pharmacologically relevant concentrations unless the conformation selectivity for both ligands is matched.

         <title>Dissecting Critical Factors for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Atomically Precise Au Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key factors in nanocluster (NCs)&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) are studied by comparing Au NCs with different sizes as well as Au38 isomer. Overall, the smaller size enables a higher activity due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, while the isomerism of the same&#8208;sized NCs can lead to significant changes in both activity and selectivity due to the difference in average formation energy of the key *COOH intermediate.







Abstract
This work investigates the critical factors impacting electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) as electrocatalysts. First, the influence of size on CO2RR is studied by precisely controlling NC size in the 1&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm regime. We find that the electrocatalytic CO partial current density increases for smaller NCs, but the CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) is not directly associated with the NC size. This indicates that the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, i.e. the population of active sites, is the dominant factor for determining the catalytic activity, but the selectivity is not directly impacted by size. Second, we compare the CO2RR performance of Au38 isomers (Au38Q and Au38T) to reveal that structural rearrangement of identical size NCs can lead to significant changes in both CO2RR activity and selectivity. Au38Q shows higher activity and selectivity towards CO than Au38T, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the average formation energy of the key *COOH intermediate on the proposed active sites is significantly lower on Au38Q than Au38T. These results demonstrate how the structural isomerism can impact stabilization of reaction intermediates as well as the overall CO2RR performance of identical size Au NCs. Overall, this work provides important structure&#8211;property relationships for tailoring the NCs for CO2RR.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Magnetic Dendrite&#8208;Shaped Microrobots for Photodynamic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;shaped hematite microrobots have been developed as an effective GSH depletion agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of prostate cancer cells. These single&#8208;component microrobots with dual light/magnetic field actuation can induce GSH depletion, greatly enhancing in vitro PDT performance and accomplishing the non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized objects.







Abstract
Photocatalytic micromotors that exhibit wireless and controllable motion by light have been extensively explored for cancer treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment can down&#8208;regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level for cancer therapy. Herein, we present dendrite&#8208;shaped light&#8208;powered hematite microrobots as an effective GSH depletion agent for PDT of prostate cancer cells. These hematite microrobots can display negative phototactic motion under light irradiation and flexible actuation in a defined path controlled by an external magnetic field. Non&#8208;contact transportation of micro&#8208;sized cells can be achieved by manipulating the microrobot's motion. In addition, the biocompatible microrobots induce GSH depletion and greatly enhance PDT performance.

     alt="Self-Propelled Magnetic Dendrite-Shaped Microrobots for Photodynamic Prostate Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendrite-shaped hematite microrobots have been developed as an effective GSH depletion agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of prostate cancer cells. These single-component microrobots with dual light/magnetic field actuation can induce GSH depletion, greatly enhancing in vitro PDT performance and accomplishing the non-contact transportation of micro-sized objects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic micromotors that exhibit wireless and controllable motion by light have been extensively explored for cancer treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment can down-regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level for cancer therapy. Herein, we present dendrite-shaped light-powered hematite microrobots as an effective GSH depletion agent for PDT of prostate cancer cells. These hematite microrobots can display negative phototactic motion under light irradiation and flexible actuation in a defined path controlled by an external magnetic field. Non-contact transportation of micro-sized cells can be achieved by manipulating the microrobot's motion. In addition, the biocompatible microrobots induce GSH depletion and greatly enhance PDT performance. The proposed dendrite-shaped hematite microrobots contribute to developing dual light/magnetic field-powered micromachines for the biomedical field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Proton Conductive Porous Framework of an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6&#8208;Ether Derivative Networked by Rigid Hydrogen Bonding Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton conductive, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a C3&#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid derivative with an 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether component. Despite flexibility of the macrocycle, H&#8208;bonding modules allow the derivative to yield a hexagonally networked framework with permanent porosity. As reported by Takayoshi Nakamura, Ichiro Hisaki et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211686), the HOF possesses 1D channels with a bottleneck composed of the macrocycles and shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH.

         <title>Unexpected Persistent Production of Reactive Oxygen Species during the Degradation of Black Phosphorous in the Darkness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation mechanism of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FLBP) is not well understood. It is now shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is involved in the FLBP degradation process even in the dark. This ROS generation is persistent and proceeds in a three&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FLBP) is easily degraded under ambient conditions which is problem that hinders the application of FLBP, but its degradation mechanism is not yet well understood. In this work, we surprisingly found that persistent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was involved in FLBP degradation even in the dark. The ROS generation patterns and mechanism were revealed by chemiluminescence (CL) and density functional theory (DFT). Meanwhile, rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) can also be removed by FLBP under dark conditions, which further shows the ROS generation during FLBP self&#8208;degradation. This work provides new insights into the FLBP self&#8208;degradation mechanism and opens opportunities to practically implement FLBP for green catalytic application.

         <title>Electrochemical Double&#8208;Layer Capacitor based on Carbon@ Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) aerogels are shaped into flexible electrode composite by a simple compression method. It shows permanent porosity and great ion diffusion pathways appropriated for electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLC). These EDLC devices demonstrated a significant areal capacitance (11.2&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with the lowest &#964;0 reported in COF&#8208;based capacitors, 50&#8197;ms, and a 98&#8201;% capacitance retention over 10&#8201;000 charge/discharge cycles.







Abstract
High energy demand results in comprehensive research of novel materials for energy sources and storage applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess appropriate features such as long&#8208;range order, permanent porosity, tunable pore size, and ion diffusion pathways to be competitive electrode materials. Herein, we present a deep electrochemical study of two COF&#8208;aerogels shaped into flexible COF&#8208;electrodes (ECOFs) by a simple compression method to fabricate an electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitor (EDLC). This energy storage system has considerable interest owing to its high&#8208;power density and long cycle life compared with batteries. Our result confirmed the outstanding behavior of ECOFs as EDLC devices with a capacity retention of almost 100&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 charge/discharge cycles and, to our knowledge, the highest areal capacitance (9.55&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in aqueous electrolytes at higher scan rates (1000&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1) for COFs. More importantly, the hierarchical porosity observed in the ECOFs increases ion transport, which permits a fast interface polarization (low &#964;0 values). The complete sheds light on using ECOFs as novel electrode material to fabricate EDLC devices.

         <title>Thermoreversible Polymorph Transitions in Supramolecular Polymers of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squaramide supramolecular polymers exhibit uncommon thermoreversible polymorph transitions between fiber&#8208; and particle&#8208;like nanostructures driven by the molecular rearrangement of the squaramide units from slipped to head&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrogen bonds.

Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded squaramide (SQ) supramolecular polymers exhibit uncommon thermoreversible polymorph transitions between particle&#8208; and fiber&#8208;like nanostructures. SQs 1&#8211;3, with different steric bulk, self&#8208;assemble in solution into particles (AggI) upon cooling to 298&#8197;K, and SQs 1 and 2, with only one dendronic group, show a reversible transformation into fibers (AggII) by further decreasing the temperature to 288&#8197;K. Nano&#8208;DSC and UV/Vis studies on SQ 1 reveal a concentration&#8208;dependent transition temperature and &#916;H for the AggI&#8208;to&#8208;AggII conversion, while the kinetic studies on SQ 2 indicate the on&#8208;pathway nature of the polymorph transition. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that these transitions are triggered by the molecular reorganization of the SQ units changing from slipped to head&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrogen bonding patterns. This work unveils the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of reversible polymorph transitions that are of interest to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln=Sm, Dy, Yb): A Mixed&#8208;Ligand Pathway to New Lanthanide(III) Multifunctional Materials Featuring Nonlinear Optical and Magnetic Anisotropy Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;ligand gateway gives new lanthanide materials with multiple functionalities which often do not coexist. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 materials are capable of generating coherent light through the second&#8208;harmonic generation and exhibiting magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This result shares new ideas for harmonizing optical and magnetic properties in single systems at the atomic level







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up assembly of optically nonlinear and magnetically anisotropic lanthanide materials involving precisely placed spin carriers and optimized metal&#8208;ligand coordination offers a potential route to developing electronic architectures for coherent radiation generation and spin&#8208;based technologies, but the chemical design historically has been extremely hard to achieve. To address this, we developed a worthwhile avenue for creating new noncentrosymmetric chiral Ln3+ materials Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln=Sm, Dy, Yb) by mixed&#8208;ligand design. The materials exhibit phase&#8208;matching nonlinear optical responses, elucidating the feasibility of the heteroanionic strategy. Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 displays paramagnetic property with strong magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This study demonstrates a new chemical pathway for creating previously unknown polar chiral magnets with multiple functionalities.

Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials are capable of generating coherent light through the second-harmonic generation and exhibiting magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin-orbit coupling. This result shares new ideas for harmonizing optical and magnetic properties in single systems at the atomic level
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom-up assembly of optically nonlinear and magnetically anisotropic lanthanide materials involving precisely placed spin carriers and optimized metal-ligand coordination offers a potential route to developing electronic architectures for coherent radiation generation and spin-based technologies, but the chemical design historically has been extremely hard to achieve. To address this, we developed a worthwhile avenue for creating new noncentrosymmetric chiral Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; materials Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ln=Sm, Dy, Yb) by mixed-ligand design. The materials exhibit phase-matching nonlinear optical responses, elucidating the feasibility of the heteroanionic strategy. Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; displays paramagnetic property with strong magnetic anisotropy facilitated by large spin-orbit coupling. This study demonstrates a new chemical pathway for creating previously unknown polar chiral magnets with multiple functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localized Lattice Expansion of FAPbBr3 to Design a 3D Hybrid Perovskite for Sensitive Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;cation 3D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (NMDAP)2FAPb4Br13 is tailored through the localized lattice expansion of 3D FAPbBr3. The resulting perovskite shows a high two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient of 60.8&#8197;cm&#8201;MW&#8722;1 and exhibits a sensitive near&#8208;infrared photoresponse with large on/off ratio (&#8776;104) and favorable stability.







Abstract
A mixed&#8208;cation 3D lead bromide hybrid perovskite (NMDAP)2FAPb4Br13 (1, NMDAP2+ = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diaminopropanium, FA+ = formamidinium) is tailored by incorporating the large NMDAP2+ cation with the small FA+ ion into 3D FAPbBr3. Structurally, the small FA+ ions occupy the prototypical cavities formed by distorted corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6 octahedra as in FAPbBr3, while the bulky NMDAP2+ ions are confined to the expanded lattice which is defined by a new structural motif composed of eight corner&#8208;sharing PbBr6 octahedra and four edge&#8208;sharing octahedra. This localized lattice expansion from FAPbBr3 creates a new branch of the intriguing 3D hybrid perovskite family, breaking the limits of the conventional Goldschmidt tolerance factor rule. Moreover, a high two&#8208;photon absorption (2AP) coefficient of 60.8&#8197;cm&#8201;MW&#8722;1 was demonstrated to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) 800&#8197;nm illumination, enabling sensitive NIR photoresponses with large on/off ratio (&#8776;104) as well as favorable stability.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence from Phosphine&#8208;Stabilized Au3 Triangles and Au3Ag Pyramids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;blue cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes were realized by using phosphine&#8208;stabilized Au3 triangles and Au3Ag pyramids, featuring electroluminescence (EL) at 436&#8197;nm and the chromatic coordinates with y &lt;0.1.These results demonstrated the number of metal nuclei and the contributions of ligands to excited states are crucial for breaking the bottleneck of EL clusters in blue region.







Abstract
The optoelectronic applications of clusters emerged rapidly. Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes (CLED) as representative hold promise as a new generation of displays and lightings. However, as one of the main challenges in electroluminescence (EL) field, until present, no deep&#8208;blue CLEDs were reported, due to the strict requirements on excited&#8208;state characteristics of clusters. Herein, two phosphine&#8208;stabilized Au3 triangle and Au3Ag pyramid named [O(Audppy)3]BF4 and [O(Audppy)3Ag](BF4)2 were chosen to demonstrate efficient deep&#8208;blue CLEDs. The ligand&#8208;incorporated charge transfer transitions of the clusters contribute to both singlet and triplet excited states of the clusters, giving rise to phosphorescence at 460&#8197;nm and EL emissions at 436&#8197;nm. Based on device engineering, the maximum luminescence beyond 8000&#8197;nits and the chromatic coordinates with y &lt;0.1 in deep&#8208;blue region verify the competence of CLEDs for high&#8208;resolution displays.

         <title>Constructing Stable Anion&#8208;Tuned Electrode/Electrolyte Interphase on High&#8208;Voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Cathode for Thermally&#8208;Modulated Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable anion&#8208;tuned &amp; solvent&#8208;derived electrode/electrolyte interphase with faster interfacial Na+ transport kinetics is established by tuning the ion&#8208;solvent configuration of electrolyte solvation structure, which contributes to thermally&#8208;modulated fast&#8208;charging batteries lasting for longer cycle life.







Abstract
Constructing stable electrode/electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics is vital for fast&#8208;charging batteries. Herein, we investigate the interphase that forms between a high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode and the electrolytes consisting of 3.0, 1.0, or 0.3&#8197;M NaClO4 in an organic carbonate solvent (47.5&#8201;:&#8201;47.5&#8201;:&#8201;5 mixture of EC: PC: FEC) during charging up to 4.5&#8197;V at 55&#8201;&#176;C. It is found that a higher anion/solvent ratio in electrolyte solvation structure induces anion&#8208;dominated interphase containing more inorganic species and more anion derivatives (CxClOy), which leads to a larger interfacial Na+ transport resistance and more unfavorable gas evolution. In comparison, a low anion/solvent ratio derives stable anion&#8208;tuned interphase that enables better interfacial kinetics and cycle ability. Importantly, the performance of a failed cathode is restored by triggering the decomposition of CxClOy species. This work elucidates the role of tuning interphase in fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Transient Stabilization Effect of CO2 in the Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Azo Compounds and the Reductive Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new transient stabilization effect (TSE) of CO2 is identified and applied to the electrochemical hydrogenation of azo compounds and the reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. The TSE influence of CO2 means that overactive intermediates can be captured by CO2 to prevent their decomposition or side reaction to complete the synthesis that is difficult to achieve by direct means. The CO2 can be released later through a decarboxylation process.







Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and utilization has attracted a great attention in organic synthesis. Herein, an unpresented transient stabilization effect (TSE) of CO2 is disclosed and well applied to the electrochemical hydrogenation of azo compounds to hydrazine derivatives. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies imply that CO2 can capture azo radical anion intermediates to protect the hydrogenation from potential degradation reactions, and is finally released through decarboxylation. The promotion effect of CO2 was further demonstrated to work in the preliminary study of electrochemical reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters to vicinal diol derivatives. For the electrochemical reductive reactions mentioned above, CO2 is indispensable. The presented results shed light on a different usage of CO2 and could inspire novel experimental design by using CO2 as a transient protecting group.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes by Photosensitized Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent seminal findings on the possibility to use photoexcited nitroarenes as modular and easily dosable reagents which can mimic the reactivity of ozonolysis for the oxidative conversion of alkenyl bonds into carbonyl groups in a highly selective fashion.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of alkenes into carbonyl molecules mainly relies on either ozonolysis or Lemieux&#8208;Johnson oxidation involving high valent transition metal oxides. Safety, technical concerns and highly oxidizing conditions of both these procedures limited their adoption in streamlined synthesis. Like ozone, photosensitized nitroarenes can deliver similar types of [3+2] cycloaddition products with alkenes through biradical formation and the resulting &#8220;N&#8208;doped&#8221; ozonides can safely be converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds through hydrolysis. The high prevalence of nitroarenes with diverse electronic and steric profiles combined with the mild oxidizing power allow to modulate site&#8208;selectivity and tolerate highly sensitive functional groups ideal for application in complex molecular setup.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;enzymatic circuitry activation strategy can realize an orthogonally controlled catalytic DNA (CCD) circuit through multiple molecular recognition events and progressively accelerated signal amplification, as reported by Fuan Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206529). The on&#8208;site activated CCD circuitry system has considerable potential for high&#8208;precision in vivo imaging of low&#8208;abundance microRNA.

         <title>Competitive Non&#8208;Radical Nucleophilic Attack Pathways for NH3 Oxidation and H2O Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish H2O oxidation kinetics on photoanodes severely obstructs the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;energy efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Herein, we find a 10 to 55&#8208;fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) on hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) photoanodes under near&#8208;neutral pH (9~11) and moderate applied potentials (1.0~1.4 VRHE) compared to H2O oxidation. By rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecules on high&#8208;valent surface Fe&#8722;O species (e.g., FeIV=O) and Fe&#8722;N species that produces NOx&#8208; and N2, respectively, which overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H2O on surface FeIV=O and contributes to a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80% for AOR. This work reveals a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from the conventional indirect radical&#8208;mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Alkene Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkene metathesis catalyzed by enantiopure metal alkylidene complexes enables exceptionally versatile strategies to products with configurationally&#8208;defined stereocenters. Desymmetriza&#173;tion processes thereby provide reliable stereoselective routes to aliphatic structures, while the differentiation of aromatic stereogenic units remained an outstanding challenge. Herein, we describe the feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation. Stereodynamic trienes are selectively converted into corresponding binaphthalene atropisomers upon exposure to a chiral molybdenum catalyst. Remarkably, stereo&#173;selective arene&#8208;forming metathesis allows enantioselectivities of up to 98:2 e.r. and excellent yields. As the disconnection of each bond of an aromatic target is retrosynthetically conceivable, it is anticipated that forging arenes by means of stereoselective metathesis will enable versatile approaches for the synthesis of a broad range of molecular topologies with precisely defined configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiazole Imide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Acceptor Homopolymer with Branched Ethylene Glycol Side Chains for Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;Type semiconducting polymers with high thermoelectric performance remain challenging due to the scarcity of molecular design strategy, limiting their applications in organic thermoelectric (OTE) devices. Herein, we provide a new approach to enhance the OTE performance of n&#8208;doped polymers by introducing acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type backbone bearing branched ethylene glycol (EG) side chains. When doped with 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI), the A&#8208;A homopolymer PDTzTI&#8208;TEG exhibits n&#8208;type electrical conductivity (&#963;) up to 34 S cm&#8208;1 and power factor value of 15.7 &#956;W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2. The OTE performance of PDTzTI&#8208;TEG is far greater than that of homopolymer PBTI&#8208;TEG (&#963; = 0.27 S cm&#8208;1), indicating that introducing electron&#8208;deficient thiazole units in the backbone further improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency. These results demonstrate that developing A&#8208;A type polymers with EG side chains is an effective strategy to enhance n&#8208;type OTE performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The popular metal&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) suffer from environmental and economic issues because of their heavy dependency on nonrenewable metals. Here, we propose a metal&#8208;free&#160;ammonium (NH4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery with a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75 V. The working mechanism of this sustainable battery involves the reversible anion (PF6&#8722;) intercalation chemistry in graphite cathode and NH4+ intercalation behavior in PTCDI (3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide) anode. This new battery configuration successfully circumvented the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and the lack of mature NH4+&#8208;rich cathodes for NH4+ion batteries (AIBs). The customized organic NH4+ electrolyte endows the graphite||PTCDI full battery with durable longevity (over 1000 cycles) and a high energy density (200 Wh kg&#8722;1). We show that the development of AIBs should be high&#8208;voltage&#8208;oriented while circumventing low operation potential to avoid NH4+ reduction.</dc:description>

In this work, we systematically investigated the selectivity and solvation effects observed for dissolution by focusing on photocatalysis, precious metals and solvents. By combining transient characterization, reaction kinetics, and density functional theory, we determined that the radicals generated in photocatalysis were the key active species in the entire reaction. The cyano functional group in the solvent was the driving factor for dissolution of gold, and the importance of chlorine radicals for dissolution of platinum group precious metals was further confirmed. In addition, the catalytic properties of different precious metals can promote different transformations of functional groups, leading to selective dissolution. The structures of photocatalytic precious metal leaches also precisely explains the special coordination forms of precious metals and functional group ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Hybrid Materials of Metal Nanoparticles and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates, anionic metal&#8722;oxygen nanoclusters that possess composition&#8208;dependent various properties, are widely used to modify the existing properties of metal nanoparticles and to endow them with new ones. Herein, we present a review of recent advances in hybrid materials that consist of metal nanoparticles and polyoxometalates. Following a brief introduction on the inception of this area and its development, representative properties and applications of these materials in various fields such as electrochemistry, photochemistry, and catalysis are introduced. We discuss that the combination of two classic inorganic materials facilitates cooperative and synergistic behavior, and we also express personal perspectives on the future development in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>CAPturAM, a Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Strategy for Selective Enrichment and Detection of Physiological CAPAM&#8208;Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified nucleotides impact all aspects of eukaryotic mRNAs and contribute to regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level. At the 5&#8242; cap, adenosine as first transcribed nucleotide is often  N  6  &#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl adenosine (m  6  A  m  ). This modification is tissue dependent and reversible, pointing to a regulatory function. CAPAM was recently identified as methyltransferase responsible for m  6  A  m  formation, however, the direct assignemnt of its target transcripts proves difficult. Antibodies do not discriminate between internal  N  6  &#8208;methyl adenosine (m  6  A) and m  6  A  m  . Here we present CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach for direct enrichment and probing of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets. We harness CAPAM&#8217;s cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on its targets. Subsequent functionalization with an affinity handle allows for their enrichment. Using wildtype and CAPAM  &#8211;/&#8211;  cells, we successfully applied CAPturAM to confirm or disprove CAPAM&#8208;targets, facilitating the verification and identification of CAPAM targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization Enabled Mimetic Synthesis of Axially Chiral B,N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral molecules bearing multiple stereogenic axes is of great importance in the field of organic chemistry. However, the efficient construction of atropisomers featuring two different types of stereogenic axes has largely unexplored. Herein, we report the novel atroposelective synthesis of configurationally stable axially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles. By using stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8208;C and C&#8208;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were also obtained. In this case, all four stereoisomers of diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles were stereodivergently afforded in high enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8230;&#960; interactions played a unique effect on the promotion of stereospecific isomerization, thereby leading to the highly efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of B/N&#8208;Doped Calix[4]arene Exhibiting Narrowband Multiple Resonance Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel macrocycle of B/N&#8208;doped calix[4]arene (C&#8208;BN)&#160;was synthesized by a one&#8208;shot double boronation. Owing to the structural tension and electron&#8208;donating properties of the nitrogen atoms in the macrocycle, reaction selectively proceeds between the adjacent benzene rings outside the macrocycle. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance (MR) fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. Benefiting from the large intermolecular distance (&gt; 4.6 &#197;) between adjacent MR&#8208;emitting cores, C&#8208;BN also exhibits excellent narrowband emitting features against aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and spectrum broadening. Optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on C&#8208;BN exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6% and small full width at half maximums of 25&#8211;28 nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12 wt %.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Proton Rectifier Using a Heterogeneous Membrane Composed of Coordination Polymer and Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational control of unidirectional proton transport is highly challenging, primarily owing to the difficulty in introducing an asymmetric factor into proton conducting media. In this study, freestanding membranes of a proton&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional porous coordination polymer, Cu  2  (CuTCPP) (H  2  TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO  3  ), were combined to generate a pH gradient in the conducting media. The current&#8211;voltage measurements revealed that the heterogeneous membrane exhibits a significant unidirectional proton transport with a proton rectification ratio exceeding 200 under 90% relative humidity in the initial voltage scan. This value is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifiers. The high designability of both components with well&#8208;defined structures, which is in contrast to the organic polymers used so far, provides a new avenue for developing and understanding the protonrectifying behavior in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>The Single&#8208;Component Flavin Reductase/Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenase AetF is a Versatile Catalyst for Selective Bromination and Iodination of Arenes and Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) natively catalyze selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic and enolate groups. Nearly all FDHs reported to date require a separate flavin reductase to supply them with FADH2&#173;, which complicates biocatalysis applications. In this study, we establish that the single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates using a commercially available glucose dehydrogenase to drive its halogenase activity. High site selectivity, activity on relatively unactivated substrates, and high enantioselectivity for atroposelective bromination and bromolactonization was demonstrated. Site&#8208;selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF. The substrate and reaction scope of AetF suggest that it has the potential to greatly improve the utility of biocatalytic halogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of C(13)/C(13&#8217;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the total synthesis of the macrodiolide C(13)/C(13')&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z via double inter&#8208;/intramolecular Stille cross&#8208;coupling of a monomeric vinyl stannane/vinyl iodide precursor to achieve macrocycle formation. The key step in the synthesis of this precursor was a stereoselective aldol reaction of a formal Evans acetate aldol product with crotonaldehyde. As demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the binding mode of C(13)/C(13')&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z to tubulin is virtually identical with that of the natural product disorazole Z. Likewise, C(13)/C(13')&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole Z inhibits tubulin assembly with at least the same potency as disorazole Z and it appears to be a more potent cell growth inhibitor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox&#8208;Coupled Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low&#8208;cost solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long&#8208;lived separated charges (&#964;ave. = 3.0 ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor&#8208;acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high&#8208;rate redox of &#8208;C=O/&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208; and &#8208;C&#8208;N/&#8208;C=N+ with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1% at 1 sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron&#8208;enriching &#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208; and hole&#8208;enriching &#8208;C=N+ groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn2+ and OTf&#8208; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed. This work presents an inspiring photoelectrochemical cathode design and theoretical insight for photoresponsive batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Edge&#8208;hosted Atomic Co&#8722;N4 Sites on Hierarchical Porous Carbon for Highly Selective Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Not only high efficiency but also high selectivity of the electrocatalysts is crucial for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we systematically investigate the edge effect of carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways (two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) or four&#8208;electron (4e&#8722;)), and conclude that the 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR proceeding over the edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co&#8722;N4  sites are more favorable than the basal&#8208;plane&#8208;hosted ones. As such, we have successfully synthesized and tuned Co&#8208;SACs with different edge&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratios. The as&#8208;prepared edge&#8208;rich Co&#8208;N/HPC catalyst exhibits excellent 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR performance with a remarkable selectivity of ~95% in a wide potential range. Furthermore, we also find that oxygen functional groups could saturate the graphitic carbon edges under the ORR operation and further promote electrocatalytic performance. These findings on the structure&#8208;property relationship in SACs offer a promising direction for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost electrochemical H2O2  production via the 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Ammonia Oxidation to Dinitrogen by a Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a nickel complex for catalytic oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen under ambient conditions. Using the aryloxyl radical 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylphenoxyl (   t   Bu  3  ArO  &#8226;  ) as H atom acceptor to cleave the N&#8208;H bond of a coordinated NH  3  ligand up to 56 equiv of N  2  per Ni center can be generated. Employing the  N  &#8208;oxyl radical 2,2,6,6&#8208;(tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO  &#8226;  ) as the H&#8208;atom acceptor, ~15 equiv of N  2  per Ni center are formed. A bridging Ni&#8208;hydrazine product identified by isotopic nitrogen (  15  N) studies and supported by computational models indicates the N&#8211;N bond forming step occurs by bimetallic homocoupling of two paramagnetic Ni&#8208;NH  2  fragments. Ni&#8208;mediated hydrazine disproportionation to N  2  and NH  3  completes the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>The Covalent Functionalization of Surface&#8208;Supported Graphene &#8208; An update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, the use of graphene supported on solid surfaces has broadened its scopes and applications, acquiring a promising role as a major component of high&#8208;performance electronic devices. In this context, the chemical modification of graphene has become essential. In particular, covalent modification offers key benefits, including controllability, stability, and the facility to be integrated into manufacturing operations. In this review, we critically comment on the latest advances in the covalent modification of supported graphene on substrates. We analyze the different chemical modifications with special attention to radical reactions. With this view, we have revised the last achievements in reactivity control, tailoring electronic properties, and introducing active functionalities. Finally, we have extended our analysis to other emerging 2D materials supported on surfaces, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, and elemental analogs of graphene. This review is an update of our previous article in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, 54,10734&#8211; 10750.</dc:description>

A reaction with CO resulted in an unprecedented insertion into the N&#8211;F bond at 2. With the carbene precursor N2CH(CO2Et) N&#8211;F bond cleavage gave the Au&#8211;F bond insertion product [Au{CHF(CO2C2H5)}(SPhos)] (7). The presence of CNtBu led to Au&#8211;N cleavage at 2 and concomitant amide formation to give the cationic complex [Au(CNtBu)(SPhos)][N(F)SO2Ph)] (5), which reacted further to give FtBu as well as the cyanido complex [Au(CN)(SPhos)] (6). These results led to the development of a process for the amination of electrophilic organic substrates by transfer of the fluoroamido group NF(SO2Ph)&#8208;.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Stable Polymer&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Safe Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serious safety risks caused by the high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes severely hamper the practicability of lithium metal batteries. By introducing unique polymerization site and more fluoride substitution, we built an in&#8208;situ formed polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase upon lithium anode to improve battery safety. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer exhibits high thermal stability, which effectively reduces the continuous exothermic reaction between electrolyte and anode/cathode. As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0 Ah lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell can be increased from 143.2oC to 174.2oC. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0oC to 338.0oC.

By introducing unique polymerization site and more fluoride substitution, we built an in-situ formed polymer-rich solid electrolyte interphase upon lithium anode to improve battery safety. The fluorine-rich and hydrogen-free polymer exhibits high thermal stability, which effectively reduces the continuous exothermic reaction between electrolyte and anode/cathode. As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0 Ah lithium-LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell can be increased from 143.2oC to 174.2oC. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0oC to 338.0oC. This work affords novel strategies upon electrolyte design, aiming to pave the way for high-energy-density and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Blown Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For 80 years, polyisocyanates and polyols were central building blocks for the industrial fabrication of polyurethane (PU) foams. By their partial hydrolysis, isocyanates release CO  2  that expands the PU network. Substituting this toxic isocyanate&#8208;based chemistry by a more sustainable variant &#8211; that  in&#8208;situ  forms CO  2  by hydrolysis of a comonomer &#8208; is urgently needed for producing greener cellular materials. Herein, we report a facile, up&#8208;scalable process, potentially compatible to existing infrastructures, to rapidly prepare water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) foams. We show that formulations composed of poly(cyclic carbonate)s and polyamines furnish rigid or flexible NIPU foams by partial hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates in the presence of a catalyst. By utilizing readily available low cost starting materials, this simple but robust process gives access to greener PU foams, expectedly responding to the sustainability demands of many sectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstructed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Heterojunction for Switchable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability simultaneously is highly required yet very challenging due to the limited intrinsic activity and their elusive evolution under harsh OER conditions. Herein, a steady self&#8208;reconstructed MOF heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy. Thanks to the inhibiting effect from hydrogen bonds of Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;1 (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid), the obatained MOF heterojunction shows greatly improved OER activity with low overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, relative to the totally reconstructed Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;3 (332 mV). Density function theory calculations reveal that the formed built&#8208;in electric field in the MOF heterojunction remarkably optimizes the ad/desorption free energy of active Ni sites. Moreover, such MOF heterojunction shows superior durability attributed to the shielding effect of the surface&#8208;evolved NiOOH coating.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthetic C&#8211;O Bond Activation in Alcohols and Alcohol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols and their derivatives are ubiquitous and versatile motifs in organic synthesis. Deoxygenative transformations of these compounds are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8211;O bond. However, electrochemically driven redox events have been shown to facilitate the C&#8211;O bond cleavage in alcohols and their derivatives either through direct electron transfer or through the use of electron transfer mediators and electroactive catalysts. Herein, a comprehensive overview of preparative electrochemically mediated protocols for C&#8211;O bond activation and functionalization is detailed, including direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectro&#8208;Microscopic Techniques for Studying Nanoplastics in the Environment and in Organisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoplastics (NPs), small (&lt; 1 &#181;m) polymer particles formed from bulk plastics, are a potential threat to human health and the environment. Orders of magnitude smaller than microplastics (MPs), they might behave different due to their larger surface area and small size, which allows them to diffuse through organic barriers. However, detecting NPs in the environment and organic matrices has proven to be difficult, as their chemical nature is similar to these matrices. Furthermore, as their size is smaller than the (spatial) detection limit of common analytic tools, they are hard to find and quantify. Here, we highlight different micro&#8208;spectroscopic techniques utilized for NP detection and argue that an analysis procedure should involve both particle imaging and correlative or direct chemical characterization of the same particles or samples. Finally, we highlight methods that can do both simultaneously, but have as downside that large particle numbers and statistics cannot be obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing MXene Electrocatalysts for Energy Conversion Reactions: Surface, Stoichiometry, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes, due to their tailorable chemistry and favourable physical properties, have great promise in electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions. To exploit fully their enormous potential, further advances specific to electrocatalysis revolving around their performance, stability, compositional discovery and synthesis are required. The most recent advances in these aspects are discussed in detail: surface functional and stochiometric modifications which can improve performance, Pourbaix stability related to their electrocatalytic operating conditions, density functional theory and advances in machine learning for their discovery, and prospects in large scale synthesis and solution processing techniques to produce membrane electrode assemblies and integrated electrodes. This minireview provides a perspective that is complemented by new density functional theory calculations which show how these recent advances in MXene material design are paving the way for effective electrocatalysts required for the transition to integrated renewable energy systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable Nickel&#8208;Iron (Oxy)hydroxide&#160;Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts through Surface Functionalization with Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;based oxides are one of the best&#8208;known active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, they rapidly lost performance in Fe&#8208;purified KOH during the reaction. Herein, tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) was loaded on a catalyst/electrolyte interface to alleviate the destabilization of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide. We propose that the degradation occurs primarily due to the release of thermodynamically unstable Fe. TPP acts as a protective layer and suppresses the dissolution of hydrated metal at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. In the electric double layer, the nonpolar TPP layer on the NiFe surface also invigorates the redeposition of the active site, Fe, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of NiFe. The TPP&#8208;coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126&#160;L h&#8208;1 for 115 h at a 1.41 mV h&#8208;1 degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Michael Acceptors to Penetrate Cells:&#160; Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake with Tetrel&#8208;Centered Exchange Cascades, Assisted by Halogen&#8208;Bonding Switches</title>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Ultralong Afterglow Emission with Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching from CsCdCl3:Mn Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet exciton&#8208;based long&#8208;lived phosphorescence is severely limited by the thermal quenching at high temperature. Herein, we propose a novel strategy based on the energy transfer from triplet self&#8208;trapped excitons to Mn2+ dopants in solution&#8208;processed perovskite CsCdCl3. It is found the Mn2+ doped hexagonal phase CsCdCl3 could simultaneously exhibit high emission efficiency (81.5%) and long afterglow duration time (150 s). Besides, the afterglow emission exhibits anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400 K. In&#8208;depth charge&#8208;carrier dynamics studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculation provide unambiguous evidence that carrier detrapping from trap states (mainly induced by Cl vacancy) to localized emission centers ([MnCl6]4&#8208;) is responsible for the afterglow emission with anti&#8208;thermal quenching. Enlightened by the present results, we demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Pulse Induced One&#8208;step Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pt on Oxide Clusters for Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed sites anchored on small oxide clusters are attractive new catalytic materials. Herein, we demonstrate an electrical pulse approach to synthesize atomically dispersed Pt on various oxide clusters in one step with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as the support (Pt1&#8208;MOx/CN). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Pt1&#8208;FeOx/CN is shown to exhibit high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94 V vs RHE, in contrast to the poor catalytic performance of atomically dispersed Pt on large Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Our work has revealed that, by tuning the size of the iron oxide down to the cluster regime, an optimal OH* adsorption strength for ORR is achieved on Pt1&#8208;FeOx/CN due to the regulation of Pt&#8208;O bonds. The unique structure and high catalytic performance of Pt1&#8208;FeOx/CN enable the Zinc&#8208;Air batteries an excellent performance at ultralow temperature of &#65293;40 &#176;C with a high peak power density of 45.1 mW cm&#8208;2 and remarkable cycling stability up to 120 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;like Charge Transport in PEDOT(OH) Films by Post&#8208;processing Side Chain Removal from a Soluble Precursor Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a route to produce highly electrically conductive doped hydroxymethyl functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films, termed PEDOT(OH) with metallic charge transport properties using a fully solution processable precursor polymer is reported. This is achieved via an ester&#8208;functionalized PEDOT derivative [PEDOT(EHE)] that is soluble in a range of solvents with excellent film&#8208;forming ability. PEDOT(EHE) demonstrates moderate electrical conductivities of 20&#8208;60 S cm  &#8208;1  and hopping&#8208;like (  i.e.,  thermally activated) transport when doped with ferric tosylate (FeTos  3  ). Upon basic hydrolysis of PEDOT(EHE) films, the electrically insulative side chains are cleaved and washed from the polymer film, leaving a densified film of PEDOT(OH). These films, when optimally doped, reach electrical conductivities of ~1200 S cm  &#8208;1  and demonstrate metallic (  i.e.,  thermally deactivated and band&#8208;like) transport properties and high stability at comparable doping levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the Distance of Adjacent Palladium Atoms for Configuration Matching in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely tailoring distance between adjacent metal sites to match adsorption configurations of key species for the targeted reaction pathway is a great challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on the atomically sites&#8208;tailored pathway in Pd catalyzed acetylene hydrogenation, i.e., increasing the distance of adjacent Pd atoms (i.e., dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd) for configuration matching in acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against coupling. The dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd is identified as a structural descriptor for describing the competitiveness for reaction pathways, and the increased dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd prefers to semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway due to simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and destabilized transition state of C2H3* coupling. Spectroscopic, kinetics and electronic structure studies reveal that increasing dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd to 3.31 &#197; delivers superior selectivity and stability, due to matched energetics scenarios and appropriate hybridization of Pd 4d with In 2s and, especially, 2p orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead&#8208;Tin Bromide with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with perfect host&#8208;guest structures are promising candidates to construct circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. However, it still remains challenging to obtain 0D chiral metal halides with simultaneously strong CPL and high photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, a new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#183;2H2O (R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O), is reported. The R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O compounds not only show intriguing self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, but also present intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177; 3.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Such CPL activities originate from the asymmetric [SnBr6]4&#8722; luminophores in R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O, due to the induced structural chirality by the organic ligands via N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, CPL emissions with tunable colors from R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#183;H2O and dehydrated compounds are reversibly observed, which extends their chiroptical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions without exogenous photocatalysts were realized using a nickel catalyst that was activated through intraligand charge transfer. Ligand polymerization afforded a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.







Abstract
We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;coupling reactions follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.

     alt="Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible-Light-Mediated Nickel-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-triggered carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross-coupling reactions without exogenous photocatalysts were realized using a nickel catalyst that was activated through intraligand charge transfer. Ligand polymerization afforded a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates stable performance in a packed-bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that several visible-light-mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross-coupling reactions can be carried out using a photoactive Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross-coupling reactions follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light-responsive nickel complexes that undergo metal-to-ligand charge transfer. Theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with visible light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross-coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed-bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Reductive Coupling of Vinyl Azaarenes and Alkynes via Photoredox Cobalt Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed to access functionalized araarene compounds bearing stereodefined tri&#8208;substituted alkenes via photoredox cobalt dual catalysis. Simple organic base together with alcohol has been applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this coupling reaction.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;induced Co&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective reductive coupling of vinyl azaarenes and alkynes has been developed. Notably, H&#252;nig's base together with simple ethanol has been successfully applied as the hydrogen sources instead of commonly used Hantzsch esters in this catalytic photoredox reaction. This approach has considerable advantages for the straightforward synthesis of stereodefined multiple substituted alkenes bearing an azaarene motif, such as excellent regioselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 for &gt;30&#8197;examples) and stereoselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;E/Z), broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility under mild reaction conditions, which has been utilized in the concise synthesis of natural product monomorine I. A reasonable catalytic reaction pathway involving protolysis of the cobaltacyclopentene intermediate has been proposed based on the mechanistic studies.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls via Enantioselective Ullmann Coupling of ortho&#8208;Chlorinated Aryl Aldehydes Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is a general and highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aldehydes enabled by a SBpy&#8208;type chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand. This mild and step&#8208;economical approach allowed the synthesis of various axially chiral biaryl dials, as well as provided the versatile intermediates for diverse axially chiral catalysts, ligands as well natural products.







Abstract
The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective reductive Ullmann coupling of ortho&#8208;chlorinated aryl aldehyde was achieved under mild reaction conditions with a chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand (+)&#8208;DTB&#8208;SBpy, thus providing axially chiral biphenyl or binaphthyl dials with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5:0.5 er. The versatility of the products as common synthetic intermediates for diverse axially chiral ligands, catalysts, and functional molecules was demonstrated by short&#8208;step transformations. This protocol also allowed the concise and highly enantioselective formal total synthesis of biologically active natural products (+)&#8208;kotanin, (&#8722;)&#8208;isoschizandrin and (+)&#8208;gossypol.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl Thianthrenium Salts with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide at room temperature has been developed. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation, this work provides an efficient site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation method, which may be used in the late&#8208;stage carboxylation modification of drug molecules.







Abstract
Carboxyl group is one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Herein, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of aryl thianthrenium salts with carbon dioxide (CO2) at room temperature has been developed. The reaction employs low loading of cuprous chloride catalyst under 1&#8197;atm CO2 and exhibits good functional group tolerance. In combination with C&#8722;H thianthrenation of aromatic hydrocarbons, this work provides an efficient method for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It may serve as a significant late&#8208;stage carboxylation tool for the modification of drug molecules in the future.

         <title>Block Poly(carbonate&#8208;ester) Ionomers as High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;esters) were designed that undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization in the polycarbonate rubbery mid&#8208;segment and are reinforced by reversible ionic interactions in the outer semi&#8208;aromatic polyester blocks. The thermoplastic elastomers show impressive tensile strength, high elastic recovery and are degradable in aqueous alkali media or chemically recyclable to monomer.







Abstract
Thermoplastic elastomers based on polyesters/carbonates have the potential to maximize recyclability, degradability and renewable resource use. However, they often underperform and suffer from the familiar trade&#8208;off between strength and extensibility. Herein, we report well&#8208;defined reprocessable poly(ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester) elastomers with impressive tensile strengths (60&#8197;MPa), elasticity (&gt;800&#8201;%) and recovery (95&#8201;%). Plus, the ester/carbonate linkages are fully degradable and enable chemical recycling. The superior performances are attributed to three features: (1)&#8197;Highly entangled soft segments; (2)&#8197;Fully reversible strain&#8208;induced crystallization and (3)&#8197;Precisely placed ZnII&#8208;carboxylates dynamically crosslinking the hard domains. The one&#8208;pot synthesis couples controlled cyclic monomer ring&#8208;opening polymerization and alternating epoxide/anhydride ring&#8208;opening copolymerization. Efficient convresion to ionomers is achieved by reacting vinyl&#8208;epoxides to install ZnII&#8208;carboxylates.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Activation: Strategic Approaches towards Realizing the Full Potential of C&#8722;H Activation in Sustainable Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of silver additives has enabled many highly valuable synthetic methods in the field of C&#8722;H activation. However, such additives are disadvantageous with respect to sustainability, scalability, and economic considerations. This Review provides a systematic overview of strategic approaches towards developing silver&#8208;free protocols based on the mechanistic role of silver.







Abstract
The activation of carbon&#8722;hydrogen bonds is considered as one of the most attractive techniques in synthetic organic chemistry because it bears the potential to shorten synthetic routes as well as to produce complementary product scopes compared to traditional synthetic strategies. However, many current methods employ silver salts as additives, leading to stoichiometric metal waste and thereby preventing the full potential of C&#8722;H activation to be exploited. Therefore, the development of silver&#8208;free protocols has recently received increasing attention. Mechanistically, silver can serve various roles in C&#8722;H activation and thus, avoiding the use of silver requires different approaches based on the role it serves in a given process. In this Review, we present the comparison of silver&#8208;based and silver&#8208;free methods. Focusing on the strategic approaches to develop silver&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation, we provide the reader with the means to develop sustainable methods for C&#8722;H activation.

&lt;p&gt;The activation of carbon&#8722;hydrogen bonds is considered as one of the most attractive techniques in synthetic organic chemistry because it bears the potential to shorten synthetic routes as well as to produce complementary product scopes compared to traditional synthetic strategies. However, many current methods employ silver salts as additives, leading to stoichiometric metal waste and thereby preventing the full potential of C&#8722;H activation to be exploited. Therefore, the development of silver-free protocols has recently received increasing attention. Mechanistically, silver can serve various roles in C&#8722;H activation and thus, avoiding the use of silver requires different approaches based on the role it serves in a given process. In this Review, we present the comparison of silver-based and silver-free methods. Focusing on the strategic approaches to develop silver-free C&#8722;H activation, we provide the reader with the means to develop sustainable methods for C&#8722;H activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Controllable Nanoassemblies of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Abnormal Disassembly&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement for In Vivo Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abnormal disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (&gt;6 folds, with quantum yields (QYs) as high as 12&#8201;%) is observed from the water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with highly redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm and QYs of 1.8&#8201;%. The nanoassemblies are fabricated through a facile and feasible method using a unique Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si crosslinking strategy in solution.







Abstract
Assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been widely observed for luminophors but it causes emission decrease after disassembly. The construction of unique nanoassemblies with disassembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (DIEE) is demanded. Herein, by taking advantages of alterable siloxane bridge crosslinking states, we report a facile strategy to fabricate water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with abnormal DIEE. The fabricated AuNP nanoassemblies with dominant interparticle crosslinking showed a redshifted emission at &#8776;1070&#8197;nm with quantum yields (QYs) of 1.8&#8201;%. After disassembly, the nanoassemblies with increased intraparticle crosslinking exhibited a unique DIEE (&gt;6 folds, QYs, 12&#8201;%) due to the enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition. Besides, the disassembly facilitated renal clearance of AuNPs to reduce nonspecific retention in the body, opening new possibilities for designing highly emissive renal&#8208;clearable nanostructures toward more bioapplications.

         <title>Aryl Fluorosulfate Based Inhibitors That Covalently Target the SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SuFEx warheads installed into a previously developed inhibitor scaffold that targets the sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) deacylase, furnishes covalently labeling inhibitors that pull down the enzyme from cells and tissue. With further optimimization of the compound's potencies, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may provide the foundation for development of highly efficient covalent chemical probes and/or drug lead compounds targeting SIRT5.







Abstract
The sirtuin enzymes are a family of lysine deacylases that regulate gene transcription and metabolism. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) hydrolyzes malonyl, succinyl, and glutaryl &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyacyllysine posttranslational modifications and has recently emerged as a vulnerability in certain cancers. However, chemical probes to illuminate its potential as a pharmacological target have been lacking. Here we report the harnessing of aryl fluorosulfate&#8208;based electrophiles as an avenue to furnish covalent inhibitors that target SIRT5. Alkyne&#8208;tagged affinity&#8208;labeling agents recognize and capture overexpressed SIRT5 in cultured HEK293T cells and can label SIRT5 in the hearts of mice upon intravenous injection of the compound. This work demonstrates the utility of aryl fluorosulfate electrophiles for targeting of SIRT5 and suggests this as a means for the development of potential covalent drug candidates. It is our hope that these results will serve as inspiration for future studies investigating SIRT5 and general sirtuin biology in the mitochondria.

         <title>Hewettite ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O with Remarkably Stable Layers and Ultralarge Interlayer Spacing for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via an ion exchange induced phase transformation, A2V6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K) was transformed to hewettite BV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O (B=Zn, Mg, Ca, Cu), accompanying with reconstructing the layers and expanding interlayer spacing. Benefiting from the remarkably stable layers and ultralarge interlayer spacing, the ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O cathode exhibits an ultralong life and ultrahigh rate capability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, substantially better than AVO.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of their intrinsic safety, low&#8208;cost and high energy&#8208;intensity. Vanadium&#8208;based materials are widely used as the cathode of ZIBs, especially A2V6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (AVO, A=NH4+, Na, K). However, AVO suffers from serious dissolution, phase transformation and narrow gallery spacing (&#8764;3&#8197;&#197;), leading to poor cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we unveiled the root cause of the performance degradation in the AVO cathode and therefore developed a new high&#8208;performance cathode of ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O (ZVO) for ZIB. Through a method of ion exchange induced phase transformation, AVO was converted to hewettite ZVO with larger gallery spacing (&#8764;6&#8197;&#197;) and more stable V6O16 layers. ZVO cathode thus constructed delivers a high capacity of 365 and 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 and 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1, while 86&#8201;% and 70&#8201;% of its capacity are retained at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles and at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10000&#8197;cycles, substantially better than conventional AVO.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic [4+2] Cycloaddition of Allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium/Malphos catalytic recipe has been developed for the dynamic kinetic intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. The desired cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products were obtained with decent yields and excellent stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Its dynamic kinetic nature has been confirmed by careful mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Rh&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes afforded cis&#8208;fused [4.3.0]bicyclic products with an excellent chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantio&#8208;selectivity. Many synthetically useful functional groups are tolerated. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated. Based on the careful experimental studies, a mechanism involving the rapid racemization of the allene moiety in the starting materials has been proposed.

Poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides with semi&#8208;coherent interface largely promotes the seperation and transfer of charge carriers owing to the build&#8208;in electric field and thereby enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency.

The construction of heterojunctions is a promising manner to accelerate the separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface. Herein, a binary poly(heptazine&#8208;triazine) imides (PHI/PTI) with semi&#8208;coherent interfaces was fabricated via a facile two&#8208;step salt&#8208;melt synthetic process. The built&#8208;in electric fields at the semi&#8208;coherent interface endow prompt exciton splitting and charge carrier separation. Hence, the optimized PHI/PTI&#8208;based copolymer presents a high apparent quantum yield (AQY=64&#8201;%) for visible&#8208;light driven hydrogen production, by the aids of K2HPO4 as charge transfer mediator. This study provides physical insights for the rational promotion of the photocatalytic performance from the viewpoint of interfacial engineering of photocatalytic junctions on crystalline carbon nitride based semiconductors.

         <title>Synthesis of Alternating Polyisocyanate Copolymers by Anionic Polymerization for Mimicking Amphiphilic Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amphiphilic conformation of  &#945;&#8208;helical peptides has important biological functions, such as ion transport, antifreeze, and innate immunity, which can be mimicked by alternating polyisocyanate copolymers. We synthesized poly(allyl isocyanate&#8208;alt&#8208;(S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl isocyanate (P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)) and ammonium&#8208;containing P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) (N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)), ensuring the amphiphilic helical conformation. The benzyl group of SMBIC plays an important role in alternating copolymerization with its steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, while AIC provides an alkene group capable of introducing a customized functional group. The P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) with predominantly alternating sequence was acquired at  f  SMBIC/f  AIC  = 8 with a controlled molecular weight and narrow dispersity. N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)s were synthesized from thiol&#8208;ene radical addition with P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC).</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Inhibits Tumor Growth by Leveraging Cellular Proteasomal Degradation System to Degrade c&#8208;Met in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current action mechanisms for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics depend on occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology to mediate protein functions. We report a new mechanism where aptamers leverage cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade proteins for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer (hereinafter referred to as c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap) binds to the extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) and selectively induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma, causing c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Furthermore, c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap can induce a decrease in the heterodimeric partner proteins of c&#8208;Met and the downstream effector proteins in the c&#8208;Met signal axis, effectively inhibiting tumor growth in A549 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice. Our study uncovers a novel, actionable mechanism for aptamer therapeutics and opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal Dihedral Angle in Twisted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Organic Emitters for Maximized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) organic formwork with a large dihedral angle (&#952;DA) is usually adopted to narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap for obtaining excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, the dependence of overall TADF properties on &#952;DA has not been systematically investigated to this day. Taking new designed CzBP, CzBP&#8208;1M and CzBP&#8208;2M via introducing methyl as investigated models, it is found that (i) with increasing &#952;DA, the charge transfer component in S1 is larger than that in T1 in varying degrees, leading to non&#8208;monotonic spin&#8208;orbit couplings; (ii) the electron&#8208;vibration couplings between S1 and T1 states become the largest when &#952;DA approaching 80o, facilitating phonon&#8208;driven up&#8208;conversion; (iii) the overall TADF rate reaches a peak at &#952;DA near 80o. By this, the TADF on/off switching is realized via methyl moiety for regulating &#952;DA from theoretical prediction to experimental confirmation. Importantly, the &#952;DA near 80o would be a good descriptor for screening excellent D&#8208;A type TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonochemically&#8208;Induced Reduction of Alkenes to Alkanes with Ammonnia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the progressive defossilization of our industry, hydrogen has been identified as a central molecule to store renewable electricity. In this context, ammonia is now rapidly emerging as a promising hydrogen carrier for the future. This game change indirectly impacts the field of fine chemistry where hydrogenation reactions are widely deployed. In particular, the possibility to perform hydrogenation reactions using NH  3  directly instead of H  2  has become highly desirable but it remains a very difficult scientific task, which we address in this communication. Here we show that the N&#8208;H bond of NH  3  can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the  in situ  formation of a diimide, which subsequently induces the hydrogenation of alkenes. Advantageously, this work does not involve any transition metal and releases N  2  as a sole co&#8208;product.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Quench Reactions of Enantioenriched Secondary Alkyllithium Reagents in Batch and Continuous Flow Using an I/Li&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a practical in situ quench (ISQ) procedure involving the generation of chiral secondary alkyllithiums from secondary alkyl iodides (including functionalized iodides bearing an ester or a nitrile) in the presence of various electrophiles such as aldehydes, ketones, Weinreb amides, isocyanates, sulfides, or boronates. This ISQ&#8208;reaction allowed the preparation of a broad range of optically enriched ketones, alcohols, amides, sulfides and boronic acid esters in typically 90&#8208;98% ee. Remarkably, these reactions were performed at &#8722;78 &#176;C or &#8722;40 &#176;C in batch. A continuous flow set&#8208;up permitted reaction temperatures between &#8722;20 &#176;C and 0 &#176;C and allowed a scale&#8208;up up to a 40&#8208;fold without further optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Storage Chemistry of Organic Cathodes for High&#8208;Energy and High&#8208;Power Density Divalent Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent batteries show promising prospects for next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we report a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode capable of highly reversible storage of tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anions in both Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) battery systems. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal the redox reaction mechanism of the PTPAn cathode material. The Mg and Ca cells exhibit a cell voltage &gt;3 V, a high&#8208;power density of ~3000 W kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;energy density of ~300 Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, the combination of the PTPAn cathode with a calcium&#8208;tin (Ca&#8208;Sn) alloy anode could enable a long battery&#8208;life of 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of 60%. The anion storage chemistry associated with dual&#8208;ion electrochemical concept demonstrates a new feasible pathway towards high&#8208;performance divalent ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligothiophene Ring Strapped Perylene Bisimides: A Functionalizable Co&#8208;axial Donor&#8208;Acceptor Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aesthetic designs from nature enable to gain new knowledge and, at the same time, inspire to materialize the unattempted scientific models. In this context, multicomponent macrocycles embody the advantage of precisely positioning the structural units to achieve efficient communication between them. However, a functionalizable macrocycle to achieve ultrafast charge separation and stabilization has not been attempted. Here, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and transient absorption of a new functionalizable macrocycle consisting of oligothiophene ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide. Transient absorption results point to a sequential improvement in charge separation and stabilization from the macrocycle to the corresponding linear dimer and 2D&#8208;polymer due to the unique design. Our macrocycle design with a supportive spatial arrangement of the donor and acceptor units will urge more complex synthetic systems with exciting electron transfer and charge separation features.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Assembly of Complex Oxindoles by Enantioselective Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral oxindoles are important chemical scaffolds found in many natural products, thus attracting considerable attention to their enantioselective synthesis. Highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthetic methods for constructing C3 quaternary oxindoles have been well&#8208;developed. However, the efficient synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted tertiary oxindoles has been rarely reported due to the ease of racemization of the tertiary stereocenter via enolization. Therefore, this research reports on multicomponent assembly (including N&#8208;aryl diazoamides, aldehydes, and enamines/indoles) of complex oxindoles using enantioselective cooperative catalysis. These reactions proceed under mild conditions and show broad substrate scope, affording the desired coupling products (&gt; 90 examples) with good to excellent stereocontrol. Additionally, this research also demonstrates the synthetic potential of this annulation by constructing the 6,6,5&#8208;tricyclic lactone core structure of Speradine A.</dc:description>

         <title>(Salen)Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogen Atom Transfer for Epoxides Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) represents arguably one of the most straightforward access to the significant chiral tertiary carbon centers, however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the first example of catalytic coordination&#8208;induced asymmetric HAT reaction has been developed relying on a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;controlled enantioselective HAT process. The reaction transforms easily accessible glycidic esters, thioesters and amides to synthetically valuable formal formaldehyde aldol adducts in an enantioconvergent manner, along with broad scope and highly regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Cyanoboration&#160;of Internal Allenes by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent cyanoboration of internal allenes with B2pin2 (bis(pinacolato)diboron) and NCTS (N&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide) derivatives is reported. The &#946;,&#947;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;cyanoborylated products were synthesized with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Computational studies revealed that nucleophilic addition of allylcopper or related intermediates on cyanation reagent is the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, while transmetalation with B2pin2 is the rate&#8208;determining step. The nucleophilic addition step proceeds via inner&#8208;sphere mechanism in the Cu(I)/P(o&#8208;tol)3 and Cu(I)/Xantphos (P(o&#8208;tol)3 = tris(o&#8208;methylphenyl)phosphine, Xantphos = 4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) catalytic systems and via outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in the Cu(II)/Xantphos catalytic system, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu Single Atom Nanozyme Based High&#8208;Efficiency Mild Photothermal Therapy through Cellular Metabolic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) drastically compromises the treatment effect of mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, we designed a polyporous Cu single atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) loaded with licogliflozin (LIK066) for HSP&#8208;silencing induced mild PTT. On one hand, LIK066 inhibits glucose uptake by shutting sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) &#8220;valve&#8221;, effectively blocking the energy source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Without sufficient energy, cancer cells cannot synthesize HSPs. In this work, Cu SAzyme presents extraordinary multienzyme activities to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm formation, which can damage the existing HSPs in cancer cells. Through a two&#8208;pronged strategy of SGLT inhibitor and ROS storm, LIK066&#8208;loaded Cu SAzyme shows high efficiency for comprehensive removal of HSPs to realize mild PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Formation and Potent Antioxidant Activity of Macrocyclic Dimers Containing Disulfide and Selenide Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During attempts to prepare dithiaspiroselenuranes as GPx mimetics, a series of unexpected dimeric macrocycles was obtained, each containing two selenide and two disulfide moieties in rings ranging from 18&#8208; to 26&#8208;membered. The products showed potent GPx&#8208;like activity in an NMR assay based on their ability to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with benzyl thiol. The high catalytic activity was attributed to transannular effects during selenide to selenoxide oxidation. This redox process was also characterized by an induction period that indicated autocatalysis in the formation of an intermediate selenoxide from the oxidation of the corresponding selenide.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemically induced selective and divergent cyanation reaction of alkynes, enabled by phosphorus radicals, is described. With the use of simple triarylphosphine as a co&#8208;catalyst, three cyanation reactions, including di&#8208;hydrocyanation, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrocyanation, and domino hydrocyanation/reduction, can be divergently achieved, furnishing a wide array of alkyl dinitriles, alkenyl nitriles, and alkyl nitriles under mild conditions. Terminal and internal alkynes are applicable with high efficiency and excellent selectivity. Synthetic applications for biologically active agents and preliminary experimental and computational mechanistic studies are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Aerobic Nitrogen Photooxidation on Titania through In Situ Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate is an important raw material for chemical fertilizers, but it is industrially manufactured in multiple steps at high temperature and pressure, urgently motivating the design of a green and sustainable strategy for nitrate production. Herein, we report the photosynthesis of nitrate from N2 and O2 on commercial TiO2 in a flow reactor under ambient conditions. The TiO2 photocatalyst offered a high nitrate yield of 1.85 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 as well as a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13%. We combined reactivity and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanism of nitrate formation and unveil the special role of O2 in N&#8801;N bond dissociation. The mechanistic insight into charge&#8208;involved N2 oxidation was further demonstrated by in situ transient absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. This work exhibits the mechanistic origin of N2 photooxidation and initiates a potential method for triggering inert catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Modified Intramolecular&#8208;Lock Strategy Enables Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy is an appealing task for designing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, but only limited examples have been reported so far. Herein we present a &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy to develop TADF emitters for improving the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The installation of an electron&#8208;deficient heptagonal diimide lock onto a highly rotatable biphenyl&#8208;based emitter not only enhances electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor that decreases singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), but also endows the skeleton with modest rigidity and flexibility that increases photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in neat film. In particular, the integration of the diimide lock also leads to an increase in horizontal orientation factor (&#920;//) from 69% to 83%. Consequently, this modified intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy enables an efficient TADF emitter to assemble high&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a high external quantum efficiency of 26.2% and a power efficiency of 76.6 lm W&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough and Recyclable Ionogels Constructed by Coordinated Supramolecular Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanical properties of most hydrogels (ionogels) are considerably affected by covalently cross&#8208;linked networks. However, the interactions between solvent/solvent molecules and solvent/polymer chains are usually ignored. Herein, a series of ultra&#8208;tough ionogels were prepared via a supramolecular solvent, halometallate ionic liquid, in which cations and coordinating anions form a 3D supramolecular network. The linear polymer chains are physically cross&#8208;linked with supramolecular solvents synergistically enhancing the strength (14.3 MPa), toughness (78 MJ m&#8208;3), and Young's modulus (55 MPa) of ionogels, effectively dispersing the stress concentration under load, and obtaining better fatigue resistance and higher fracture energy (198 kJ m&#8208;2). Furthermore, the reversible cross&#8208;linking enables green recovery and recycling of ionogels, simply by water. This strategy shows broad applicability based on a variety of supramolecular solvents and coordinatable polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis of Urea with Nitrate and Carbon Dioxide over Iron&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient electrocatalysts to generate key *NH  2  and *CO intermediates is crucial for ambient urea electrosynthesis with nitrate (NO  3  &#8208;  ) and carbon dioxide (CO  2  ). Here we report a liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation method to fabricate symbiotic graphitic carbon encapsulated amorphous iron and iron oxide nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe  3  O  4  /CNTs). Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe  3  O  4  /CNTs exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis using NO  3  &#8208;  and CO  2  , affording a urea yield of 1341.3&#177;112.6 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  cat  &#8208;1  and a faradic efficiency of 16.5&#177;6.1% at ambient conditions. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe  3  O  4  on CNTs provide dual active sites for the adsorption and activation of NO  3  &#8208;  and CO  2  , thus generating key *NH  2  and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation. This work would be helpful for design and development of high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts for ambient urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Oxide Catalysts for Preferential Oxidation of CO in H2 with an Ultra&#8208;wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 (PROX) reaction is a promising solution to the on&#8208;board purification of CO&#8208;contaminated H2 fuel for use in next&#8208;generation proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). However, achieving high CO selectivity, activity and structural stability across the wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate centimeter scale interfacial PROX catalysts grown from nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline Pr2O3 and Nd2O3 monoliths with lattice surface&#8208;deposited Pt clusters at nanoscale. We demonstrate complete and selective removal of CO in H2 over an unprecedented wide temperature window (253&#8208;403 K). The monoliths are integrated with an operational PEMFC to purify the H2 fuel contaminated with CO (30 ppm) and enable stable power output for &gt;400 h; over two thousand times longer than without. This work demonstrates that the nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths can simultaneously achieve the stability and overall performance required to realize practically useful PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Nitroreductase Imaging via Fluorescence and Chemical Shift Dependent 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroreductase (NTR) is an important biomarker widely used to evaluate the degree of tumor hypoxia. Although a few optical methods have been reported for detecting nitroreductase at low concentration ranges, an effective strategy for nitroreductase monitoring in vivo without limits to the imaging depth is still lacking. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;mode NIR fluorescence and 19  F MRI agent, FCy7&#8208;NO 2  , is proposed for imaging tumor hypoxia. We show that FCy7&#8208;NO 2  serves as not only a rapid NIR fluorescence enhanced probe for monitoring bioimaging of nitroreductase in tumors, but also a novel 19  F MR chemical shift&#8208;sensitive contrast agent for selectively detecting nitroreductase catalyzed reduction. Notably, integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO 2  enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase in a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit. In general, this agent has a remarkable response to nitroreductase, which provides a promising method for understanding tumor evolution and its physiological role in the hypoxic microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <title>Host Spin&#8208;Crossover Thermodynamics Indicate Guest Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) metal&#8208;organic cages capable of switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states have the potential to be used as magnetic sensors and switches. Variation of the donor strength of heterocyclic aldehyde subcomponents in imine&#8208;based ligands can tune the ligand field for a FeII  center, which results in both homoleptic and heteroleptic cages with diverse SCO behaviors. The tetrahedral SCO cage built from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde is capable of encapsulating various guests, which stabilize different cage spin states depending on guest size. Conversely, the SCO tetrahedron exhibits different affinities for guests in different spin states, which is inferred to result from subtle structural differences of the cavity caused by the change in metal center spin state. Examination of SCO thermodynamics across a series of host&#8208;guest complexes enabled sensitive probing of guest fit to the host cavity, providing information complementary to binding&#8208;constant determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Hofmeister Anion Selectivity via a Mechanical Bond Effect in Neutral Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exceptionally strong halogen bonding (XB) donor&#8208;chloride interactions are exploited for the chloride anion template synthesis of neutral XB [2]rotaxane host systems which contain perfluoroaryl&#8208;functionalised axle components, including a remarkably potent novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif. Halide anion recognition properties in aqueous&#8208;organic media, determined via extensive 1H NMR halide anion titration experiments, reveal the rotaxane host systems exhibit dramatically enhanced affinities for hydrophilic Cl&#8208; and Br&#8208;, but conversely diminished affinities for hydrophobic I&#8208;, relative to their non&#8208;interlocked axle counterparts. Crucially, this mechanical bond effect induces a binding selectivity which directly opposes Hofmeister bias. Free&#8208;energy analysis of this mechanical bond enhancement demonstrates anion recognition by neutral XB interlocked host systems as a rare and general strategy to engineer anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias anion selectivity in synthetic receptor design.</dc:description>

         <title>The Function of Two Radical&#8208;SAM Enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, in the Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In biosynthesis of the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (1) is 3&#8208;methylated to form 2, then 4&#8208;guanylylated to form 3, and converted to the full cofactor. HcgA&#8208;G proteins catalyze biosynthetic reactions. Here, we report the function of two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, using in vitro complementation experiments and purified enzymes. In vitro biosynthesis using the cell extract from the Methanococcus maripaludis &#916;hcgA strain was complemented with HcgA or precursors 1, 2 or 3. The results suggested that HcgA catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction that forms 1. We demonstrated the formation of 1 by HcgA using the 3&#8208;kDa cell extract filtrate as the substrate. Biosynthesis in the &#916;hcgG system was recovered by HcgG but not by 3, which indicated that HcgG catalyzes the reactions after biosynthesis of 3. The data indicated that HcgG contributes to the formation of CO and completes biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor.</dc:description>

         <title>Control the Single&#8208;, Two&#8208;, and Three&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to control the single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence of metal nanoclusters. In this work, the control over the non&#8208;linear optics of metal nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished via exploiting the solvent effect. An emissive nanocluster, Au9Ag6(SPh t OMe)4(DPPOE)3Cl3, was synthesized and structurally determined. The solvent effect can not only control the fluorescence of this nanocluster, but more significantly, it can also regulate the photoluminescence nature of the cluster as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. We concluded that the increased solution polarity, improved dipole moment, enlarged HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, and reduced solution viscosity of the cluster in solutions endow them with excellent high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence. The results provide an intriguing cluster template that enables us to manipulate the linear and nonlinear optics at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrifying Adipic Acid Production: Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidation and C&#8208;C Cleavage of Cyclohexanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adipic acid is a central platform molecule for the polymer industry. Its production via the alternative electro&#8208;reforming technology to the thermochemical route points to a more sustainable process. Herein, we discovered that the incorporation of Cu2+ into the Ni hydroxide lattices significantly improved the electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate with a high yield (84%) and selectivity (87%). This Cu promotion effect could serve as a probe to combine with product analysis, steady&#8208;state kinetics and in situ spectroscopy to investigate the mechanism, which involves a first two&#8208;electron oxidation into cyclohexanone and then consecutive hydroxylation and C&#8208;C cleavage at early stages before the dione formation. The central role of Cu2+ is to weaken the interaction between the NiOOH and surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical that facilitates the subsequent C&#8208;C cleavage. This enables a highly efficient two&#8208;electrode system of electro&#8208;reforming KA oil into adipate and pure H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Suprasomes Based on Host&#8211;Guest Molecular Recognition: An Excellent Alternative to Liposome in Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes and polymersomes, typical vesicular drug delivery systems (DDSs), have faced some limitations in cancer theranostics. Suprasomes, supramolecular vesicles assembled from amphiphiles linked by noncovalent interactions, show potential as new generation of vesicular DDSs. We construct suprasomes based on host&#8211;guest recognition, by which the desired functions can be integrated into carriers without tedious synthesis. Photothermally active host&#8211;guest complex is formed between a functional guest and pillar[5]arene, which further self&#8208;assembles into hollow suprasomes. A supramolecular nanomedicine is developed by encapsulating cisplatin in the suprasomes. The obtained cisplatin@Suprasomes achieve excellent anticancer efficacy and anti&#8208;metastasis combining chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, which ablate the tumors without relapse and metastasis. This work demonstrates the facile functionalization of suprasomes, holding promise as alternatives to liposomes and polymersomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Liquids Responsive to Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous liquid is a unique liquid medium that combines cavity of porous solid with the fluidity of liquid, and this special characteristic makes it potential in various applications. Here we report the type II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) by dissolving photoresponsive metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (PMOP, constructed from dicopper and azobenzene&#8208;containing carboxylate) in polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;functionalized bulky ionic liquid (IL). Owing to favorable ion interactions, bulky IL molecules encircle outside PMOP, and the inter cavities are maintained. The azobenzene moieties can be isomerized freely in the obtained PPILs to expose and shelter active sites upon visible and UV light irradiations. Hence, the adsorption capacity of PPILs is controllable by light irradiation, and the change in CO2 uptake is up to 30% than neat IL with negligible change. This study may inspire the development of new adsorption process regulated by light instead of pressure and temperature swing adsorption.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the formation of giant {Mo  126  W  30  } polyoxometalate cages templated by &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar ligands. Their inorganic shells incorporate arrays of 18 stacked aromatic carboxylates, such as 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate or 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate, and the assembly is stabilized by multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. NMR data confirmed that the cages are stable in solution and the inner aromatic templates can be postsynthetically replaced by selected aliphatic dicarboxylates, paving the way for endo&#8208;functionalization and exploration of the reactivities within the cage cavities.</dc:description>
