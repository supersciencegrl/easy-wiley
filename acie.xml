         <title>Iodide&#8208;Induced    Fragmentation   of Polymerized Hydrophilic Carbon Nitride for High Performance Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e  &#8208;  ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H  2  O  2  production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2e  &#8208;  ORR greatly restrict the H  2  O  2  production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the  terminating polymerization (TP&#8208;PCN) effect of iodide ions  . The obtained TP&#8208;PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H  2  O  2  generation rate (3265.4 &#181;M h  &#8208;1  ), far surpassing PCN and other PCN&#8208;based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP&#8208;PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin&#8208;orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O  2  , which optimizes O  2  activation and reduces the energy barrier of H  2  O  2  formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O  2  activation in ORR for H  2  O  2  production.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning and Directing Energy Transfer in the Whole Visible Spectrum through Linker Installation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While limited choice of emissive organic linkers with systematic emission tunability presents a great challenge to investigate energy transfer (ET) over the whole visible light range with designable directions, luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) may serve as an ideal platform for such study due to their readily tunable structure and composition. Herein, five Zr  6  cluster&#8208;based LMOFs, HIAM&#8208;400X (X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acids as organic linkers. Their emission energies range from ~470 to 645 nm. The accessible unsaturated metal sites confer HIAM&#8208;400X as a pristine scaffold for postsynthetic modification via linker installation. Six 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based dicarboxylic acids (L) with their emission energies covering the entire visible spectrum were successfully installed into HIAM&#8208;400X matrix to form thirty HIAM&#8208;400X&#8208;L LMOFs, in which the energy transfer can be facilely tuned by controlling its direction, either from the inserted linkers to pristine MOFs or from the pristine MOFs to inserted linkers, and over the whole range of visible light. The combination of the pristine MOFs and the second linkers via linker installation creates a powerful two&#8208;dimensional space in tuning the emission via energy transfer in LMOFs. This work sheds light on a new strategy in designing target&#8208;specific materials for light&#8208;harvesting, energy transfer and related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Neutralization Assay using Single Molecule Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) manifests with high clinical variability and warrants sensitive and specific assays to analyze immune responses in infected and vaccinated individuals. Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed an assay to assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. The assay does not require live viruses or cells and can be performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory within two hours. We used this assay to assess neutralization and antibody levels in patients who died of COVID&#8208;19 and patients hospitalized for a short period of time, and show&#160;that neutralization and antibody levels increase over time. We also adapted the assay for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and measured neutralization capacity in pre&#8208;pandemic healthy, COVID&#8208;19 infected, and vaccinated individuals. This assay is highly adaptable for clinical applications, such as vaccine development and epidemiological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic, Intermolecular C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution of heme proteins has opened access to new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic activity that can be harnessed to tackle synthetic challenges. Among these, reactions resulting from active site iron&#8208;nitrenoid intermediates present a powerful strategy to forge C&#8211;N bonds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Here we report a biocatalytic, intermolecular benzylic C&#8211;H amidation reaction operating at mild and scalable conditions. With hydroxamate esters as nitrene precursors, feedstock aromatic compounds can be converted to chiral amides with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) and high yields (up to 87%). Kinetic and computational analysis of the enzymatic reaction reveals rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by stepwise hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Consecutive and Selective Double Methylene Insertion of Lithium Carbenoids to Isothiocyanates: A Direct Assembly of Four&#8208;membered Sulfur&#8208;Containing Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal CH  2  &#8208;CH  2  homologation conducted with C1 carbenoids on a carbon electrophile for the obtainment of a four&#8208;membered cycle is reported. The logic proposes the consecutive delivery of two single nucleophilic CH  2  units to an isothiocyanate &#8211; as competent electrophilic partner &#8211; resulting in the assembling of a rare imino&#8208;thietane cluster. The single synthetic operation procedure documents genuine chemocontrol, as indicated by the tolerance to various reactive elements decorating the starting materials. Significantly, the double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, thus not requiring the installation of heteroatom&#8208;centered manifolds (  e.g.  boron).</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;nanometer Thick Wafer&#8208;size NiO Films with Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adding ferromagnetism into semiconductors attracts much attentions due to its potential usage of magnetic spins in novel devices, such as spin field&#8208;effect transistors. However, it remains challenging to stabilize their ferromagnetism above room temperature. Here we introduce an atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy to grow wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale of 0.92 nm for the first time. Surface lattice defects break the magnetic symmetry of NiO and produce surface ferromagnetic behaviors. Our sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 157 emu/cc and coercivity of 418 Oe. Attributed to wafer size, the easily&#8208;transferred ferromagnetic NiO thin film is further verified in a magnetoresistance device. Our work provides a sub&#8208;nanometric platform to produce wafer&#8208;size ferromagnetic NiO thin films as atomic layer magnetic units in future transparent magnetoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling gene expression in mammalian cells using multiplexed conditional guide RNAs for Cas12a</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal control of the activity of CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) proteins is of considerable interest for basic research and therapeutics. Here, we show that conditional guide RNAs (gRNAs) for Cas12a can be transcribed in mammalian cells by RNA polymerase II, followed by activation via input&#8208;dependent processing of the 3&#8217; tail of the gRNA transcript. We demonstrate processing using an RNA strand

displacement mechanism, as well as microRNA&#8208;dependent processing, and cleavage by a guanine&#8208;responsive ribozyme. We further demonstrate that Cas12a along with several independently switchable gRNAs can be compactly integrated on a single transcript using stabilizing RNA triplexes, providing a route towards Cas12a&#8208;based gene regulation constructs with multi&#8208;input switching capabilities. The

principle is shown to work in HEK and mouse fibroblast cells using luminescence, fluorescence, and is also demonstrated for the conditional upregulation of an endogenous gene.</dc:description>

         <title>Vertical Graphene Arrays with Straightaway Ions Capacitance for AC Line&#8208;Filtering Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC), as an ideal lightweight filtering capacitor, can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC)  . However, current electrodes are stuck in limited electrode area and tortuous ion transport. Herein, strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) prepared by electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition have been successfully designed as the main electrode to ensure ions rapidly adsorb/desorb in richly available graphene surface. SVGAs exhibit an outstanding specific areal capacitance of 1.72 mF&#8231;cm  &#8722;2  at &#934;  120  = 80.6&#176; even after 500,000 cycles, which is far better than that of most carbon&#8208;related materials. Impressively, the output voltage could also be improved to 2.5 V when using organic electrolyte. An ultra&#8208;high energy density of 0.33 &#956;Wh&#8231;cm  &#8722;2  can also be handily achieved. Moreover, ECs&#8208;SVGAs can well smooth arbitrary AC waveforms into DC signals, exhibiting excellent filtering performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Carbochlorocarbonylation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons via C&#8722;COCl Bond Cleavage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a catalytic system comprised of Pd and Xantphos, acid chlorides can be added across strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to form two new C&#8722;C bonds via formal C&#8722;COCl cleavage. This reaction allows for a dicarbofunctionalisation in which an acid chloride group is retained in the product. DFT studies are used to rationalise a plausible pathway, while product derivatisation highlights the synthetic utility of the method.







Abstract
Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8722;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or a tethered alkyne to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride in situ. The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.

         <title>Rational Design of Sustainable Liquid Microcapsules for Spontaneous Fragrance Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a PEG&#8208;g&#8208;PVAc amphiphilic graft copolymer together with hydrophobic fragrances in aqueous medium leads to the spontaneous formation of colloidally stable suspensions of liquid coacervate droplets. Arrows indicate the local turbulences sustaining the spontaneous mixing of the components. The bottom panel shows the confocal Raman microspectroscopy mapping of a multicompartment coacervate droplet with carvone as fragrance.







Abstract
The high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. Herein, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.

         <title>Synthesis of Mixed&#8208;Valent Lanthanide Sulfide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4; and EuS, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4 were prepared. The phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.







Abstract
In targeting reduced valent lanthanide chalcogenides, we report the first nanoparticle synthesis of the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4. Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, we prepared nanoparticles of EuS, Eu3S4, EuSm2S4, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4. All nanoparticle phases were identified using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm morphology and nanoparticle size, and magnetic susceptibility measurements for determining the ordering temperatures and valence. The UV/Vis, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies for each phase were compared. Surprisingly, the phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.

Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In targeting reduced valent lanthanide chalcogenides, we report the first nanoparticle synthesis of the mixed-valent ferromagnets Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and EuSm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, we prepared nanoparticles of EuS, Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, EuSm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SmS&lt;sub&gt;1.9&lt;/sub&gt;, and Sm&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. All nanoparticle phases were identified using powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm morphology and nanoparticle size, and magnetic susceptibility measurements for determining the ordering temperatures and valence. The UV/Vis, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies for each phase were compared. Surprisingly, the phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed EuS while EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O into CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO&#8208;66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS2 sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allows photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O into CH3COOH and O2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2 reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2 nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2 composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH3COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2 for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.

         <title>Discovery and Characterisation of Highly Cooperative FAK&#8208;Degrading PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PROTAC with an unusually short linker potently degrades focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SPR and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly cooperative FAK&#8208;PROTAC&#8208;VCB ternary complex, and FAK degradation showed enhanced effects on 3D cell growth compared to FAK inhibitors. In mice, GSK215 induced rapid and sustained degradation of FAK with a profound PK/PD disconnect.







Abstract
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK&#8208;GSK215&#8208;VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in&#8208;vitro pharmacology compared to VS&#8208;4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long&#8208;lasting effect on FAK levels (&#8776;96&#8197;h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK&#8208;degradation biology in&#8197;vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cross&#8208;coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with alkylamine and aldehyde feedstocks has been achieved. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained with generally good yields and optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible with excellent stereocontrol. This method provides a novel disconnection strategy for the synthesis of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes that utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.

         <title>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem for synergistic chemical and gene regulations on cancer cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating multiple molecular interactions within a system to realize the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is prospected to be of great potential in cancer therapy. Herein, we report a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem, which reprogrammed the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations. In the nanosystem, amphipathic telluroether was coordinated with Mn(II) to self&#8208;assemble into micelle, on which a siNrf2 integrated DNA network was assembled. The great electron&#8208;donating capability of telluroether was revealed to greatly promote Mn(II)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reaction to generate subversive &#183;OH in cancer cells. In response to adenosine triphosphoric acid, the siNrf2 was specially released in cytoplasm for down&#8208;regulating expression of detoxification enzymes, which enhanced chemocatalysis&#8208;mediated oxidative stress in cancer cells, thus significantly suppressing tumor progression.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic C3&#8208;Indole Methylation&#8212;A Useful Tool for the Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired Stereoselective Synthesis of Pyrroloindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the promiscuous C3&#8208;indole methyl transferase PsmD enabled the enantioselective synthesis of various pyrroloindolines. By additionally applying the halo methyl transferase CtHMT not only the expensive SAM cofactor could be recycled, but also the enzymatic preparative scale transformation was achieved.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds bearing a pyrroloindole framework is often laborious. In contrast, there are several S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyl transferases known for stereo&#8208; and regioselective methylation at the C3 position of various indoles, directly leading to the formation of the desired pyrroloindole moiety. Herein, the SAM&#8208;dependent methyl transferase PsmD from Streptomyces griseofuscus, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, is characterized in detail. The biochemical properties of PsmD and its substrate scope were demonstrated. Preparative scale enzymatic methylation including SAM regeneration was achieved for three selected substrates after a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiment optimization.

         <title>Sustainable Pd(OAc)2/Hydroquinone Cocatalyst System for Cis&#8208;Selective Dibenzoyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and scalable cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocol that employs catalytic hydroquinone with tBuOOH as a benign terminal oxidant. A bromide additive was crucial to obtaining good yields and excellent cis selectivity. The study culminates in the implementation of the optimized reaction on large scale.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;diacyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO2, which limit process sustainability and large&#8208;scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from trans to cis diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high cis selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>A Copper(I) Complex with Two Unpaired Electrons, Synthesised by Oxidation of a Copper(II) Complex with Two Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation&#8208;induced reduction: The oxidation of mononuclear CuII complexes with novel unsymmetric redox&#8208;active urea azine or thio&#8208;urea azine ligands leads to metal reduction and formation of complexes with intriguing electronic structures. The stability in several redox states is the basis for their first application in catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Two homoleptic copper(II) complexes [Cu(L1)2] and [Cu(L2)2] with anionic redox&#8208;active ligands were synthesised, one with urea azine (L1) and the other with thio&#8208;urea azine (L2) ligands. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox&#8208;induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)2]+ and [Cu(L2)2]+ with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)2]+ is best described as a CuI complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)2]+ is a CuI complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)2]2+, best described as a CuI complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile ligand&#8208;metal electron transfer make these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.

         <title>Highly Selective Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene over Atomically Isolated Nickel&#8208;Nitrogen Site/Copper Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective CO  2  electroreduction reaction (CO  2  RR) into desired value&#8208;added multicarbon products such as C  2  H  4  is of great importance but largely limited by the multi&#8208;electron transfer process and sluggish C&#8208;C coupling step at one single active site. Herein, an effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to improve the selectivity of the CO  2  RR towards C  2  H  4  by multiple distinct catalytic sites in local vicinity. An earth&#8208;abundant elements&#8211;based tandem electrocatalyst PTF(Ni)/Cu is constructed by uniformly dispersing Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on the porphyrinic triazine framework anchored with atomically isolated nickel&#8208;nitrogen sites (PTF(Ni)) for the enhanced CO  2  RR to produce C  2  H  4  . The Faradaic efficiency of C  2  H  4  reaches 57.3% at &#8208;1.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is about 6 times higher than the non&#8208;tandem catalyst PTF/Cu, which produces CH  4  as the major carbon product. The operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the local high concentration of CO generated by PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8208;C coupling to form C  2  H  4  on the nearby Cu NP sites. The work offers an effective avenue to design electrocatalysts for the highly selective CO  2  RR to produce multicarbon products via a tandem route.</dc:description>

         <title>A Systematic Study of the Effects of Complex Structure on Aryl Iodide Oxidative Addition at Bipyridyl&#8208;Ligated Gold(I) Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined theoretical and experimental approach has been used to study the unusual mechanism of oxidative addition of aryl iodides to [bipyAu(C  2  H  4  )]  +  complexes. The modular nature of this system has allowed a systematic assessment of the effects of complex structure. Computational comparisons between cationic gold and the isolobal (neutral) Pd(0) and Pt(0) complexes revealed similar mechanistic features, but with oxidative addition being significantly favored for the group 10 metals. Further differences between Au and Pd were seen in experimental studies: studying reaction rates as a function of electronic and steric properties showed that ligands bearing more electron&#8208;poor functionality increase the rate of oxidative addition; in a complementary way, electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides give faster rates. This divergence in mechanism compared to Pd suggests that Ar&#8208;X oxidative addition with Au can underpin a broad range of new or complementary transformations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
New tellurate LTT and LST crystals were obtained by a TSSG method with a broad transparent region of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m for MIR NLO applications. Both LTT and LST belong to the space group Pnn2, with an almost identical structure. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder SHG response. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder SHG based on the crystal structures.







Abstract
Oxide crystals have been widely used in nonlinear optics (NLO) in the ultraviolet&#8211;visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Most traditional oxide crystals are restricted to the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their narrow transmission window. Hence, attempting to extend infrared cutoff wavelength of oxides has attracted much attention. Herein, we report two new tellurates Li2TiTeO6 (LTT) and Li2SnTeO6 (LST) with broad transparent regions of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, as excellent candidates for mid&#8208;infrared NLO applications. Both LTT and LST crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnn2. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder second&#8208;order generation efficiency (26&#215;KDP) under the fundamental wavelength of 1064&#8197;nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder second&#8208;harmonic generations based on the crystal structures. Our results provide a novel oxide NLO crystal with a strong SHG and wide transparency range. They also pave a way for the design of new oxide mid&#8208;IR NLO crystals.

         <title>PtSe2/Pt Heterointerface with Reduced Coordination for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small Pt particles are generated in situ on the surface of PtSe2 nanosheet with Se vacancies for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
PtSe2 is a typical noble metal dichalcogenide (NMD) that holds promising possibility for next&#8208;generation electronics and photonics. However, when applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it exhibits sluggish kinetics due to the insufficient capability of absorbing active species. Here, we construct PtSe2/Pt heterointerface to boost the reaction dynamics of PtSe2, enabled by an in situ electrochemical method. It is found that Se vacancies are induced around the heterointerface, reducing the coordination environment. Correspondingly, the exposed Pt atoms at the very vicinity of Se vacancies are activated, with enhanced overlap with H 1s orbital. The adsorption of H. intermediate is thus strengthened, achieving near thermoneutral free energy change. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2/Pt exhibits extraordinary HER activity even superior to Pt/C, with an overpotential of 42&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work raises attention on NMDs toward HER and provides insights for the rational construction of novel heterointerfaces.

         <title>Designing Anion&#8208;Type Water&#8208;Free Zn2+ Solvation Structure for Robust Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free Zn2+ solvation structure electrolyte for developing a Zn metal anode. The chloride salt with bulky cations unlocks the Zn2+&#8208;water interactions, and a new solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722; is formed without bound water. Owing to the limited hydrogen evolution reaction and the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and anion, the electrolyte shows an average Zn plating/stripping CE of &#8776;99.9&#8201;% and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries are potential for large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage due to their low cost and high security. However, Zn metal anode suffers from the dendritic growth and interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in the deterioration of electrode/battery performance. Here we propose that both dendrites and HER are related to the water participated Zn2+ solvation structure&#8208;Zn(H2O)62+ and thus can be resolved by transforming Zn(H2O)62+ to an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722;, which is achieved in traditional ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte after adding chloride salt with a bulky cation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). The elimination of cation&#8208;water interaction suppresses HER, while the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and the anion solvation structure inhibits dendrite formation. As a result, the electrolyte shows uniform Zn deposition with an average Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.9&#8201;%, enabling a capacity retention of 78.8&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles in anode&#8208;free Zn batteries with pre&#8208;zincificated polyaniline as the cathode. This work provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to prevent HER and realize long&#8208;lifespan metal anode.

         <title>Selective Detection of Cu+ Ions in Live Cells via Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a new fluorescent probe that upon binding to copper(I) (but not any other physiologically relevant metal ions), displays an intensity switch&#8208;on as well as a significant change in its fluorescence lifetime. The later has allowed us to visualize copper(I) in live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.







Abstract
Copper is an essential trace element in living organisms with its levels and localisation being carefully managed by the cellular machinery. However, if misregulated, deficiency or excess of copper ions can lead to several diseases. Therefore, it is important to have reliable methods to detect, monitor and visualise this metal in cells. Herein we report a new optical probe based on BODIPY, which shows a switch&#8208;on in its fluorescence intensity upon binding to copper(I), but not in the presence of high concentration of other physiologically relevant metal ions. More interestingly, binding to copper(I) leads to significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the new probe, which can be used to visualize copper(I) pools in lysosomes of live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Topochemical Ene&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed monomer having reactive groups, azide and alkene, adopts suitable crystal packing for a novel topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction (TEAC). Spontaneously, the monomer undergoes polymerization to yield triazoline&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion. The triazoline&#8208;linked polymer is transformed into a value&#8208;added aziridine&#8208;linked polymer by simple heating.







Abstract
Topochemical reactions, high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state reactions arising from the proximal alignment of reacting partners in the crystal lattice, do not require solvents, catalysts, and additives, are of high demand in the context of green processes and environmental safety. However, the bottleneck is the limited number of reactions that can be done in the crystal medium. We present the topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) reaction, wherein alkene and azide groups undergo lattice&#8208;controlled cycloaddition reaction giving triazoline in crystals. A designed monomer that arranges in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner in its crystals pre&#8208;organizing the reacting groups of adjacent molecules in proximity undergoes spontaneous cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, yielding the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. A unique advantage of this reaction is that the triazoline can be converted to aziridine by simple heating, which we exploited for the otherwise challenging post&#8208;synthetic backbone modification of the polymer. This reaction may revolutionize the field of polymer science.

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8211;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic capability of squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases to convert (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;substrates enantiospecifically to (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;configurated monocyclic terpenoids was put into action by a combination of enzyme evolution and substrate engineering for the synthesis of (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone with &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids, an SHC&#8208;wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC (AciSHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (E/Z)&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased to 79&#8201;%. Notably, analyzed AciSHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the (Z)&#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99&#8201;% ee), the (E)&#8208;isomer was converted to the (S,S)&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95&#8201;% ee). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9&#8201;% ee) could be obtained.

Muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene visualized a paramagnetic species produced by addition of muonium (Mu). DFT calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two isomers, and the metastable conformer including the almost planar fused tricyclic unit simulated the experimental hfcs. The metastable structure is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to light muon (&#956;+).







Abstract
In this communication, we report muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for understanding radical reactivity of 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene. Transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#956;SR) and muon avoided level&#8208;crossing resonance (&#956;LCR) measurements successfully visualized a paramagnetic species produced by regioselective addition of muonium (Mu) to the skeletal phosphorus atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two possible isomers. Whereas the most stable isomer including the envelope&#8208;type phosphorus heterocycle shows considerably different hyperfine coupling constants (hfcs) from those of the TF&#8208;&#956;SR and &#956;LCR, the metastable structure accompanying the almost planar tricyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton could simulate the experimentally determined hfcs. The metastable planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated paramagnetic tricyclic&#8208;fused skeleton is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to the light muon (&#956;+), one ninth of the proton mass.

         <title>Chemoselective and Highly Sensitive Quantification of Gut Microbiome and Human Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective probes based on stable isotope labeling allow for highly sensitive mass spectrometric quantification and detection of metabolites at attomole quantities in three human sample types.







Abstract
The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host's physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl&#8208;containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging. Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi&#8208;quantitative analysis at the femtomole level as well as qualitative analysis at attomole quantities that allows for detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics&#8208;driven biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our chemical biology tool will be of general use in metabolomics analysis to obtain a better understanding of microbial interactions with the human host and disease development.

         <title>Para&#8208;hydrogen hyperpolarization allows direct NMR detection of &#945;&#8208;amino acids in complex (bio)mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The scope of non&#8208;hydrogenative para&#8208;hydrogen hyperpolarization (PHIP) techniques has been expanding over the last years, with the continuous addition of important classes of substrates. For example, pyruvate can now be hyperpolarized using the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) technique, offering a fast, efficient and low&#8208;cost PHIP alternative to Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for metabolic imaging studies. Still, important biomolecules such as amino acids have so far resisted PHIP, unless properly functionalized. Here, we report on an approach to non&#8208;hydrogenative PHIP for unmodified &#945;&#8208;amino acids that allows their detection and quantification in complex mixtures at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method was tested on human urine, in which natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids could be measured after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both  m  &#8208;BA and  p  &#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while  o  &#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggered reversible disassembly of an engineered protein nanocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein nanocages play crucial roles in sub&#8208;cellular compartmentalization and spatial control in all domains of life and have been used as biomolecular tools for applications in biocatalysis, drug delivery, and bionanotechnology. The ability to control their assembly state under physiological conditions would further expand their practical utility. To gain such control, we introduced a peptide capable of triggering conformational change at a key structural position in the largest known encapsulin nanocompartment. We report the structure of the resulting engineered nanocage and demonstrate its ability to disassemble and reassemble on demand under physiological conditions. We demonstrate its capacity for in vivo encapsulation of proteins of choice while also demonstrating in vitro cargo loading capabilities. Our results represent a functionally robust addition to the nanocage toolbox and a novel approach for controlling protein nanocage disassembly and reassembly under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spirocycles through Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Vinyloxiranes with Nucleophilic Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient and straightforward methods for obtaining all optically active isomers of structurally rigid spirocycles from readily available starting materials is of great value in drug discovery and chiral ligand development. However, the stereodivergent synthesis of spirocycles bearing multiple stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge owing to steric hindrance and ring strain. Herein, we report an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis of rigid spirocycles through dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of oxy &#960;&#8208;allyl metallic dipoles with less commonly employed nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters). A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were easily synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner (up to 19:1 dr, &gt;99% ee), which showed great promise as a new type of N&#8208;olefin ligand. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effects (KIE), competitive experiment, and visual kinetic analysis were also carried out to understand the process of this bimetallic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Principle for DUV NLO Materials: &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Confinement Enlarges Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current nonlinear optical materials face a conventional limitation in the trade&#8208;off between the band gap and birefringence, especially in the deep UV spectral region. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, to partially decouple the interunit &#960;&#8208;conjugated interactions by the separation of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The goal is to further enlarge the band gap to a value larger than that of the singular &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterpart and to maintain a suitable density of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units to gain a large optical anisotropy. We reveal that &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement is a shared structural feature for all DUV NLO materials known to date, and thus, it provides a novel and essential design criterion for future design synthesis. Guided by this principle, the carbonophosphates are predicted to be a new promising DUV candidate system. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 (1) and Na3X[PO4][CO3] (X = Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, 2&#8211;5) exhibit not only greatly enhanced birefringence that is 3&#8211;24 times larger than that of singular phosphates but also enhanced band gaps that are 0.2&#8211;1.7 eV wider than those of singular carbonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense Packing of Acetylene in a Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of porous materials have been realized for the challenging C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation with high selectivities; however, most of them suffer from high regeneration energy, poor stability or high cost that largely dampens their industrial implementation. A desired adsorbent should have an optimal balance between excellent separation performance, high stability, and low cost, but such a material is elusive. We herein report a stable, low&#8208;cost and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum metal&#8211;organic framework (CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H) for highly efficient C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation. The suitable pore confinement in CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H can not only provide multipoint binding interactions with C  2  H  2  but also enable the dense packing of C  2  H  2  molecules inside the pores. This material thus exhibits one of the highest C  2  H  2  storage density of 392 g L  &#8208;1  reported so far and highly selective adsorption of C  2  H  2  over CO  2  at ambient conditions, achieved through a relatively low C  2  H  2  adsorption enthalpy (27 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ). Breakthrough experiments confirm its excellent separation performance for C  2  H  2  /CO  2  mixtures, affording both large C  2  H  2  uptake of 3.3 mmol g  &#8208;1  and high separation factor of 3.4 that both surpass most benchmark materials. In combination with ultrahigh stability, low cost and easy scalability, CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H represents an exceptional material that shows the benchmark balance between separation performance, stability and cost for C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation.</dc:description>

A desired adsorbent should have an optimal balance between excellent separation performance, high stability, and low cost, but such a material is elusive.

         <title>Tuning Protein Dynamics to Sense Rapid Endoplasmic&#8208;Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), R&#8208;CatchER and G&#8208;CatchER2, with ultrafast kinetics and large fluorescence dynamic ranges are introduced. R&#8208;CatchER was applied to sense multi&#8208;scale calcium dynamics in endoplasmic reticulum. A design principle of GECIs is proposed that features a tuning of rapid dynamics and electrostatic potentials of fluorescent proteins.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;scale calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, exhibiting wide&#8208;ranging temporal kinetics, constitutes a ubiquitous mode of signal transduction. We report a novel endoplasmic&#8208;reticulum&#8201;(ER)&#8208;targeted Ca2+ indicator, R&#8208;CatchER, which showed superior kinetics in&#8197;vitro (koff&#8805;2&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1, kon&#8805;7&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and in multiple cell types. R&#8208;CatchER captured spatiotemporal ER Ca2+ dynamics in neurons and hotspots at dendritic branchpoints, enabled the first report of ER Ca2+ oscillations mediated by calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs), and revealed ER Ca2+&#8208;based functional cooperativity of CaSR. We elucidate the mechanism of R&#8208;CatchER and propose a principle to rationally design genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators with a single Ca2+&#8208;binding site and fast kinetics by tuning rapid fluorescent&#8208;protein dynamics and the electrostatic potential around the chromophore. The design principle is supported by the development of G&#8208;CatchER2, an upgrade of our previous (G&#8208;)CatchER with improved dynamic range. Our work may facilitate protein design, visualizing Ca2+ dynamics, and drug discovery.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling&#8208;Enabled Reactivity of Manganese Metal**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;mediated reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates by ball milling is reported. The process has been optimised and its mechanism explored by CV measurements, radical trapping, and EPR spectroscopy. Control experiments identify the action of ball milling rather than mortar and pestle is necessary to realise the effective activation of manganese, which can then be used in either solution or a ball mill for subsequent reactions.







Abstract
Efforts to generate organomanganese reagents under ball&#8208;milling conditions have led to the serendipitous discovery that manganese metal can mediate the reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates. The newly uncovered process has been optimized and its mechanism explored using CV measurements, radical trapping experiments, EPR spectroscopy, and solution control reactions. This unique reactivity can also be translated to solution whereupon pre&#8208;milling of the manganese is required.

     alt="Ball-Milling-Enabled Reactivity of Manganese Metal**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A manganese-mediated reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates by ball milling is reported. The process has been optimised and its mechanism explored by CV measurements, radical trapping, and EPR spectroscopy. Control experiments identify the action of ball milling rather than mortar and pestle is necessary to realise the effective activation of manganese, which can then be used in either solution or a ball mill for subsequent reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to generate organomanganese reagents under ball-milling conditions have led to the serendipitous discovery that manganese metal can mediate the reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates. The newly uncovered process has been optimized and its mechanism explored using CV measurements, radical trapping experiments, EPR spectroscopy, and solution control reactions. This unique reactivity can also be translated to solution whereupon pre-milling of the manganese is required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Titanium Nitride Nanozyme for pH&#8208;Responsive and Irradiation&#8208;Enhanced Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doping significantly improves the peroxidase (POD) activity of titanium&#8208;based nanozymes. Titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) showed enhanced POD activity under NIR laser irradiation due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and temperature effects. Combined with glucose oxidase in liposomes, a TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;based nanoplatform (TLGp) showed an excellent antitumor activity under NIR&#8208;mediated mild thermal conditions through its cascade&#8208;catalytic activity.







Abstract
Nanozyme&#8208;based catalytic tumor therapy is an emerging therapeutic method with high reactivity in response to tumor microenvironments (TMEs). To overcome the current limitations of deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes, we studied the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on non&#8208;metallic&#8208;atom doping and irradiation. Nitrogen doping significantly enhanced the peroxidase activity of Ti&#8208;based nanozymes, which was shown experimentally and theoretically. Based on the excellent NIR&#8208;adsorption&#8208;induced surface plasmon resonance and photothermal effect, the enzymatic activity of TiN nanoparticles (NPs) was further improved under NIR laser irradiation. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and irradiation&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (TLGp) is presented by using TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;encapsulated liposomes linked with pH&#8208;responsive PEG&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive GOx&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, nitrogen&#8208;doping, and irradiation&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity of TiN NPs and mild&#8208;photothermal therapy enables an effective tumor inhibition by TLGp with minimal side effects in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color Tuning of Narrowband Emission in Multi&#8208;resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescence Materials through Rational Imine/Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and versatile design strategy enabled wide&#8208;range color tuning of narrowband emissions in organoboron luminogenic molecules. The introduction of imine and amine moieties into a boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton (see structures) caused hypsochromic and bathochromic emission band shifts, respectively, thereby leading to deep&#8208;blue to yellow narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence with excellent color purity.







Abstract
Establishing a simple and versatile design strategy to finely modulate emission colors while retaining high luminescence efficiency and color purity remains an appealing yet challenging task for the development of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials. Herein, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing imine and electron&#8208;donating amine moieties into a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton enables systematic hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts of narrowband emissions, respectively. By this method, effective electroluminescence color tuning was accomplished over a wide visible range from deep&#8208;blue to yellow (461&#8211;571&#8197;nm), using the same MR molecular system, without compromising very narrow spectral features. Deep&#8208;blue to yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 19.0&#8211;29.2&#8201;% and superb color purity could be produced with this family of color&#8208;tunable MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Construction of A High&#8208;flux Protein Transport Channel Inspired by the Nuclear Pore Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), herein we have established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the selective introduction of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest system into one side of an artificial concave (hour&#8208;glass) shaped nanochannels. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels. In view of these promising results, the use of artificial nanochannels to improve protein transport not only provides a new potential chemical model for biological research and better understanding of protein transport behavior in the living systems, but also provides a high&#8208;flux protein transporter device, which may have applications in the design of protein drug release systems, protein separation systems and microfluidics in the near future.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positioning essential elements of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to mitochondria can conquer the rigorously spatiotemporal limitation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer and make considerable differences in PDT. However, precise accumulation of&#160; photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen within mitochondria is still challenging. Here, Hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) and 3&#8208;bromopyruvic acid (3BP) are simultaneously encapsulated into microparticles collected from X&#8208;ray irradiated tumor cells (X&#8208;MP). After systemic administration, the developed HAL/3BP@X&#8208;MP can specifically target and recognize tumor cells, where HAL induces the efficient accumulation of PpIX in mitochondria  via  the intrinsic haem biosynthetic pathway; meanwhile, 3BP remarkably increases the oxygen supply by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The accurate co&#8208;localization and prompt encounter of PpIX and oxygen produce sufficient ROS to directly disrupt mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved PDT outcomes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) are aspiring candidates for low environmental impact energy storage, especially when using organic electrodes. In this respect, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all&#8208;organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence &#8220;hybrid&#8221;, inexpensive and non&#8208;fluorinated Na/Mg&#8208;salts, it displays favourable physico&#8208;chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window &gt;3 V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long&#8208;term sustainability, and improved safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers from amphiphilic phosphodiester&#8208;linked azobenzene trimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic phosphodiester&#8208;linked azobenzene trimer has been exploited in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers. It can reversibly undergo thermal and photoisomerization between  Z  and  E  isomers in EtOH solution. Its self&#8208;assembly properties in aqueous medium have been investigated by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, demonstrating that  E  &#8208; and  Z  &#8208;azobenzene trimers form supramolecular nanosheets and toroidal nanostructures, respectively.&#160; By virtue of the  E  /Z photoisomerization of azobenzene units of the trimer, these two different supramolecular morphologies can be switched upon photoirradiation. This finding paves the way towards stimuli&#8208;responsive water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers which hold great promise in the construction of smart functional materials and also in biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity, &#956;M affinities and high turn&#8208;on ratios. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.







Abstract
Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with Kd values ranging from 190&#8197;nM to 74&#8197;&#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn2+ co&#8208;released with insulin during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording of isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt;100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets. The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn2+ and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.

         <title>A Simple Gas&#8211;Solid Treatment for Surface Modification of Li&#8208;Rich Oxides Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gas&#8211;solid treatment of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with ferrous oxalate is proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancies and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with high capacity are expected to be the next generation of cathode materials. However, the irreversible and sluggish anionic redox reaction leads to the O2 loss in the surface as well as the capacity and voltage fading. In the present study, a simple gas&#8211;solid treatment with ferrous oxalate has been proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancy and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion. In addition, the surface doping of Fe&#8208;ion can further stabilize the structure. Accordingly, the treated Feox&#8208;2&#8201;% cathode exhibits superior capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% and 85.5&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C and 2&#8197;C to that (75.3&#8201;% and 75.0&#8201;%) of the pristine sample after 300&#8197;cycles, respectively. Then, the voltage fading is significantly suppressed to 0.0011&#8197;V per cycle at 2&#8197;C especially. The encouraging results may play a significant role in paving the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides cathode.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Carboxylation Reaction of 1,1&#8208;Diarylethylenes via Hydrorhodation&#8208;Rhodium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives has been achieved by using a bulky rhodium catalyst under a CO2 atmosphere. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that tandem hydrorhodation and rhodium migrations, which include unique aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration, are operative in the reaction conditions.







Abstract
A meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation reaction of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives with CO2 by using a rhodium catalyst with NaOiPr as a stoichiometric reductant has been achieved. Together with hydrogenation of the ethylene moiety, a carboxyl group was introduced to the meta&#8208;position of the aryl ring with high selectivity over the ortho&#8208;positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that this carboxylation reaction proceeds via hydrorhodation on the ethylene moiety, followed by 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration and successive 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration on the aryl ring. The use of a bulky phosphine ligand seems to be the key to this unusual aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium shift.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Markovnikov Hydroxycarbonylation and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Vinyl Arenes: Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpropanoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids has been developed. Several non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, and ketoprofen were synthesized in high yields and ees in gram scale.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydroxycarbonylation is one of the most fundamental yet challenging methods for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. Herein, we reported the development of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water. A monodentate phosphoramidite ligand L6 plays vital role in the reaction. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups, and provides a facile and atom&#8208;economical approach to an array of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids including several commonly used non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The catalytic system has also enabled an asymmetric Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with alcohols to afford 2&#8208;arylpropanates. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the hydropalladation is irreversible and is the regio&#8208; and enantiodetermining step, while hydrolysis/alcoholysis is probably the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <dc:description>Two novel nitrogen&#8208;doped, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based nanographenes (NGs)  1  and  2  bearing an azepine and an azocine at the fjord region respectively, were synthesized and characterized. Notably, structure  1  was synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide, followed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and Scholl&#8208;type reactions, which represents a modified strategy to construct NGs. The azo&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded NG  1  leads to a saddle shape, and the azo&#8208;octagon&#8208;embedded NG  2  exhibits a distorted saddle&#8208;helix conformation with the largest torsion angle recorded so far in [5]helicenes.&#160; As a result, the different structural topographies for NGs  1  and  2  lead to significant changes in the optical properties including UV absorption and fluorescent emission.

         <title>Luminescent Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Multicolor Particle Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of fluorescence labeling techniques has attracted widespread interest in various fields, including biomedical science as it can facilitate high&#8208;resolution imaging and the spatiotemporal understanding of various biological processes. We herein report a supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy using luminescent metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and common and commercially available dye molecules. The rapid labeling process (&lt;5 min) produces ultrathin coatings (~10 nm) on diverse particles (e.g., organic, inorganic, and biological entities) with customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) simply through the selection of fluorophores. The fluorescent coatings are stable at pH from 1 to 8 and in complex biological media owing to the dominant &#960; interactions between the dyes and MPNs. These coatings exhibit negligible cytotoxicity and their strong fluorescence is retained even when internalized into intracellular compartments. This supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy is expected to provide a versatile approach for fluorescence labeling with potential in diverse fields across the physical and life sciences, including materials science and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Aromaticity Relief as an Approach to Stabilize Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new strategy to stabilize free radicals electronically is described by conjugating formally&#8208;antiaromatic substituents to the free radical. With an antiaromatic substituent, the radical acts as an electron sink to allow configuration mixing of a low&#8208;energy zwitterionic state that provides antiaromaticity relief to the substituent. A combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography, VT&#8208;EPR and VT&#8208;UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, as well as computational analysis, was used to investigate this phenomenon. We find that this strategy of antiaromaticity relief is successful at stabilizing radicals, but only if the antiaromatic substituent is constrained to be planar by synthetically imposed conformational restraints that enable state mixing. This work leads to the counterintuitive finding that increasing the antiaromaticity of the radical substituent leads to greater radical stability, providing proof of concept for a new stereoelectronic approach for stabilizing free radicals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pickering emulsions, foams, bubbles and marbles are dispersions of two immiscible liquids or of a liquid and a gas that are stabilized by colloidal particles with amphiphilic properties (i.e. partially hydrophilic/hydrophobic or oleophilic/oleophobic). These systems can be used for engineering of L&#8208;L&#8208;S and G&#8208;L&#8208;S microreactors for multiphase reactions, combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They constitute original platforms for reengineering already established multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Control of Sacrificial Bond Transformation in the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Molecular Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed metal&#8211;nitrogen sites show great prospect for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), whereas the unsatisfactory adsorption&#8208;desorption behaviors of oxygenated intermediates on the metal centers impede improvement of the ORR performance. We propose a new conceptual strategy of introducing sacrificial bonds to remold the local coordination of Fe&#8722;N  x  sites, via controlling the dynamic transformation of the Fe&#8722;S bonds in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst. Spectroscopic and theoretical results reveal that the selective cleavage of the sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds induces the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxidized sulfur on the Fe centers. The newly functionalized moieties endow the catalyst with superior ORR activity and remarkable stability, owing to the reduced electron localization around the Fe centers facilitating the desorption of ORR intermediates. These findings provide a unique perspective for precisely controlling the coordination structure of single&#8208;atom materials to optimize their activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids Provide&#160;Insight&#160;into the Mechanisms of CYP152 Peroxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CYP152 peroxygenases catalyze decarboxylation and hydroxylation of fatty acids using H2O2&#160;  as cofactor. To understand the molecular basis for the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of these unique P450 enzymes, herein, we analyze the activities of three representative CYP152 peroxygenases (OleTJE, P450SP&#945;  and P450BS&#946;) towards  cis&#8208; and  trans&#8208;dodecenoic acids as substrate probes. The unexpected 6S&#8208;hydroxylation of the  trans&#8208;isomer and 4R&#8208;hydroxylation of the  cis&#8208;isomer by OleTJE, and molecular docking results suggest that the unprecedented selectivity is likely due to OleTJE's preference of C2&#8208;C3  cis&#8208;configuration. More surprisingly, in addition to the common epoxide products, undecanal is the unexpected major product of P450SP&#945;  and P450BS&#946;  regardless the  cis/trans&#8208;configuration of substrates. The combined isotopically&#8208;labeled H218O2  tracing experiments, MD simulations and QM/MM calculations unravel an unusual mechanism for Compound I&#8208;mediated aldehyde formation, in which the active site water derived from H2O2  activation is involved in the generation of a four&#8208;membered ring lactone intermediate. These findings provide new insights into the unusual mechanisms of CYP152 peroxygenases.</dc:description>

         <title>Corroles: The Hitherto Elusive Parent Macrocycle and its Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The science and technology of corroles, macrocycles that owe their name to the cobalt&#8208;chelating prosthetic group of Vitamin B12 and share numerous features with the iron&#8208;chelating porphyrin present in heme proteins/enzymes, constantly crosses new boundaries ever since stable derivatives became easily accessible. Particularly important is the increasing utilization of corroles and the corresponding metal complexes for the benefit of mankind, in terms of new drug candidates for treating various diseases and as catalysts for sustainable energy relevant processes. One still unmet challenge is to gain access to the plain macrocycle, as to allow for a full elucidation of the most fundamental properties of corroles. We now report the success in obtaining the substituents&#8208;free corrole, by several surprising and conceptually different pathways. Selected features of the corresponding metal complexes are illuminated, for pointing towards unique phenomena that are anticipated to largely expand the horizon regarding their utilization for contemporary catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Flow Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Divergent and Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Massarinolin&#8197;A, Purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E, 2,3&#8208;Deoxypurpurolide&#8197;C, and Structural Revision of Massarinolin&#8197;A</title>

         <dc:description>
The first total syntheses of complex bergamotane sesquiterpenes massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide&#8197;C were achieved with key steps involving an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement, a furan oxidative cyclization, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation and sigmatropic elimination. Our synthesis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A.







Abstract
Massarinolin&#8197;A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes condensed with a variety of synthetically challenging ring systems: a bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, an oxaspiro[3.4]octane, and a dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (oxaspirolactone). Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E, and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide C. Our synthesis and computational analysis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. The divergent approach features an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to install the first stereogenic center in high ee, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation, and a Myers&#8217; NBSH&#8208;promoted sigmatropic elimination to install the exo methylene group of massarinolin&#8197;A.

         <title>Observability of paramagnetic NMR signals at over 10&#8201;000 ppm chemical shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution paramagnetic NMR resonances of a ferrous complex with an intermediate spin ground state with chemical shifts beyond ten thousand ppm were detected, the observability of which are attributed to a large rhombic zero&#8208;field splitting resulting in an effective suppression of the dipolar relaxation mechanism.







Abstract
We report an experimental observation of 31P&#8197;NMR resonances shifted by over 10&#8201;000&#8197;ppm (meaning percent range, and a new record for solutions), and similar 1H chemical shifts, in an intermediate&#8208;spin square planar ferrous complex [tBu(PNP)Fe&#8208;H], where PNP is a carbazole&#8208;based pincer ligand. Using a combination of electronic structure theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance, the influence of magnetic anisotropy and zero&#8208;field splitting on the paramagnetic shift and relaxation enhancement is investigated. Detailed spin dynamics simulations indicate that, even with relatively slow electron spin relaxation (T1 &#8776;10&#8722;11&#8197;s), it remains possible to observe NMR signals of directly metal&#8208;bonded atoms because pronounced rhombicity in the electron zero&#8208;field splitting reduces nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.

         <title>Azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Oxygen Interaction: A Crystal Engineering Tool for Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental evidence for the azide&#8208;oxygen noncovalent interaction in dictating the conformation of molecules having these functional groups in vicinity is provided. 36 Crystal structures of designed compounds were analyzed. Additionally, a CSD search revealed the frequent occurrence of this interaction in reported crystal structures. This interaction might find use in designing supramolecular architectures and in crystal engineering.







Abstract
We have designed, synthesized, and crystallized 36 compounds, each containing an azide group and an oxygen atom separated by three bonds. Crystal structure analysis revealed that each of these molecules adopts a conformation in which the azide and oxygen groups orient syn to each other with a short O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#946; contact. Geometry&#8208;optimized structures [using M06&#8208;2X/6&#8211;311G(d,p) level of theory] also showed the syn conformation in all 36 of these cases, suggesting that this is not merely a crystal packing effect. Quantum topological analysis using Bader's Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory revealed bond paths and bond critical points (BCP) in these structures suggesting its nature and energetics to be similar to weak hydrogen bonding. The NCI&#8208;RDG plot clearly revealed the attractive interaction consisting of electrostatic or dispersive components in all the 36 systems. NBO analysis suggested a weak orbital&#8208;relaxation (charge&#8208;transfer) contribution of energy for a few (sp2)O&#8208;donor systems. Natural population analysis (NPA) and molecular electrostatic potential mapping (MESP) of these crystal structures further revealed the existence of favorable azide&#8208;oxygen interaction. A CSD search indicated the frequent and consistent occurrence of this interaction and its role dictating the syn conformation of azide and oxygen in molecules where these groups are separated by 2&#8211;4 bonds.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Arylbenzylation of Alkenylarenes: Kinetic Studies Reveal Autocatalysis by ZnX2**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylbenzylation reaction of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents to furnish 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures, the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. Kinetic studies and competition experiments reveal that the reaction is autocatalyzed by ZnX2 by activating benzyl halides, potentially by a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction with the halide, which increases the catalytic rate by a factor of three.







Abstract
We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective arylbenzylation of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents. The reaction furnishes differently substituted 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures that are reminiscent of the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. The reaction is also compatible for the coupling of internal alkenes, secondary benzyl halides and variously substituted arylzinc reagents. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds with a rate&#8208;limiting single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process and is autocatalyzed by in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated ZnX2. The reaction rate is amplified by a factor of three through autocatalysis upon addition of ZnX2.

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;Index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With density functional theory, the phenomena that drive the shape selectivity of NiO particles crystallized by molten salt synthesis were studied. Trapezohedral NiO particles are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to the interaction of locally ordered alkali&#8208;chloride structures with the growing high&#8208;index oxide facets, thus acting as capping agents. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO formation is driven by the dissociative adsorption of water.







Abstract
Given the strong influence of surface structure on the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, understanding the mechanisms that control crystal morphology is an important component of designing catalytic materials with targeted shape and functionality. Herein, we employ density functional theory to examine the impact of growth media on NiO crystal faceting in line with experimental findings, showing that molten&#8208;salt synthesis in alkali chlorides (KCl, LiCl, and NaCl) imposes shape selectivity on NiO particles. We find that the production of NiO octahedra is attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H2O, whereas the formation of trapezohedral particles is associated with the control of the growth kinetics exerted by ordered salt structures on high&#8208;index facets. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that growth inhibition of metal&#8208;oxide facets occurs by a localized ordering of molten salts at the crystal&#8211;solvent interface. These findings provide new molecular&#8208;level insight on kinetics and thermodynamics of molten&#8208;salt synthesis as a predictive route to shape&#8208;engineer metal&#8208;oxide crystals.

         <title>The Voltage Dependent Sidedness of the Reprotonation of the Retinal Schiff Base Determines the Unique Inward Pumping of Xenorhodopsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique behaviour of inward proton pumping xenorhodopsins (XeR) makes these microbial rhodopsins an alternative optogenetic tool to the passively transporting light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. channelrhodopsin&#8208;1 and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. Here, we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).







Abstract
The new class of microbial rhodopsins, called xenorhodopsins (XeRs),[1] extends the versatility of this family by inward H+ pumps.[2&#8211;4] These pumps are an alternative optogenetic tool to the light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. ChR1,2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. In this work we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).[1] The photodynamic behavior of NsXeR was investigated on the ps to s time scale elucidating the formation of the J and K and a previously unknown long&#8208;lived intermediate. The pH dependent kinetics reveal that alkalization of the surrounding medium accelerates the photocycle and the pump turnover. In patch&#8208;clamp experiments the blue&#8208;light illumination of NsXeR in the M state shows a potential&#8208;dependent vectoriality of the photocurrent transients, suggesting a variable accessibility of reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base. Insights on the kinetically independent switching mechanism could furthermore be obtained by mutational studies on the putative intracellular H+ acceptor D220.

         <title>Generation of &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals by H. Transfer and their Use in Cycloisomerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular derivatives of pinacol (Bpin), are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors, generating &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals from H2 in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst. These radicals undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations onto appropriate double bonds, eventually furnishing densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals can be stabilized by delocalization of their spin density into the vacant p orbital of a boron substituent. &#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular pinacol (Bpin) derivatives, are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors. Under H2, in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst, they generate &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals; these species can undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations if appropriate double bond acceptors are present, leading to densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance with wide scope, and the resulting boronate products can be converted into other useful functionalities.

         <title>The Significance of Properly Reporting Turnover Frequency in Electrocatalysis Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Turnover frequency (TOF) serves as an accurate descriptor of the intrinsic activity of a catalyst. However, if it is reported at all, it has not been accurately determined in most of the recent studies on electrocatalytic reactions involving both fuel generation and fuel consumption. This Viewpoint stresses the significance of realistic TOF data in the development of new electrocatalysts.







Abstract
For decades, turnover frequency (TOF) has served as an accurate descriptor of the intrinsic activity of a catalyst, including those in electrocatalytic reactions involving both fuel generation and fuel consumption. Unfortunately, in most of the recent reports in this area, TOF is often not properly reported or not reported at all, in contrast to the overpotentials at a benchmarking current density. The current density is significant in determining the apparent activity, but it is affected by catalyst&#8208;centric parasitic reactions, electrolyte&#8208;centric competing reactions, and capacitance. Luckily, a properly calculated TOF can precisely give the intrinsic activity free from these phenomena in electrocatalysis. In this Viewpoint we ask: 1)&#8197;What makes the commonly used activity markers unsuitable for intrinsic activity determination? 2)&#8197;How can TOF reflect the intrinsic activity? 3)&#8197;Why is TOF still underused in electrocatalysis? 4)&#8197;What methods are used in TOF determination? and 5)&#8197;What is essential in the more accurate calculation of TOF? Finally, the significance of normalizing TOF by Faradaic efficiency (FE) is stressed and we give our views on the development of universal analytical tools to determine the exact number of active sites and real surface area for all kinds of materials.

         <title>Single&#8208;phase formation of Rh2O3 nanoparticles on h&#8208;BN support for highly controlled methane partial oxidation to syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure&#8211;property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non&#8208;uniform metal&#8211;support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single&#8208;phase corundum&#8722;Rh2O3(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h&#8208;BN support. Atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and first&#8208;principle calculation reveal that the single&#8208;phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh2O3(I) (110) seed plane on well&#8208;defined h&#8208;BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h&#8208;BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping the H2/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Persistent and Stable Porous Radical Polymers by Electronical Isolation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated organic radical polymers with stable radical features are difficult to design because the &#960; conjugation in the polymer backbones makes the radicals readily delocalize and tend to undergo covalent bonding processes. In this work, we report an electronical isolation strategy to design stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling reaction from a meta&#8208;position active monomer. The meta linkage ensures less conjugation in the polymer skeletons, localizes the resonant radicals, and prevent them from recombination. The resulting porous radical polymer exhibits exceptional radical characters with ultralow bandgap of 0.68 eV, strong yet extended UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption up to 1800 nm, and high spin density. The above features make the polymer very promising in the photothermal conversion with record&#8208;high photothermal temperature increment of ~240 &#186;C and striking solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of electronical isolation of radicals for producing outstanding photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Parent B2N2&#8208;Perylenes with Different BN Orientations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of parent B2N2&#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations have been synthesized based on the BN&#8208;naphthalene building block. The effects of BN with different orientations on structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties are systematically investigated. This work provides an efficient synthetic strategy for BN&#8208;PAHs and a deep insight into the structure&#8211;property relationship of BN&#8208;PAHs.







Abstract
Introducing BN units into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons expands the chemical space of conjugated materials with novel properties. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific BN positions and orientations. Here, three new parent B2N2&#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations are synthesized with BN&#8208;naphthalene as the building block, providing systematic insight into the effects of BN incorporation with different orientations on the structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties. The intermolecular dipole&#8211;dipole interaction shortens the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance. The crystal structure, (anti)aromaticity, and photophysical properties vary with the change of BN orientation. The revealed BN doping effects may provide a guideline for the synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific stacking structures, and the synthetic strategy employed here can be extended toward the synthesis of larger BN&#8208;embedded PAHs with adjustable BN patterns.

         <title>Synthesis of Multicompositional Onion&#8208;like Nanoparticles via RAFT Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles comprising multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core is described. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers and the number of layers can be tailored as desired, making complex particle design possible.







Abstract
Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles of diameters 100&#8211;150&#8197;nm comprising well&#8208;defined multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core was conducted using surfactant&#8208;free aqueous macroRAFT emulsion polymerization. The imposed constraints on chain mobility as well as chemical incompatibility between the blocks result in microphase separation, leading to formation of an onion&#8208;like multilayered particle morphology with individual layer thicknesses of approximately 20&#8197;nm. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers as well as the number of layers can be tailored as desired, offering more complex particle design compared to approaches relying on self&#8208;assembly of preformed diblock copolymers within particles. Microphase separation can occur in these systems under conditions where the corresponding bulk system would not theoretically result in microphase separation.

         <title>Rational Surface&#8208;Defect Control via Designed Passivation for High&#8208;Efficiency Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is used to intentionally passivate the VI in the CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite thin films. The synergistic effect of Lewis base&#8211;acid interaction and H&#8208;bond strengthens the adsorption of HA molecules on the surface of perovskite. The fabricated PSCs with HA passivation significantly reduced the number of uncoordinated Pb2+ and achieved a record 20.8&#8201;% efficiency.







Abstract
Iodine vacancies (VI) and undercoordinated Pb2+ on the surface of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films are mainly responsible for nonradiative charge recombination. An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is used to passivate the VI in perovskite films. A theoretical study shows that HA bonds to the VI on the surface of the perovskite film via a Lewis base&#8211;acid interaction; an additional hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) strengthens such interaction owing to the favorable molecular configuration of HA. Undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters are passivated, leading to significantly reduced surface trap density and prolonged charge lifetime within the perovskite films. HA passivation also induces an upward shift of the energy band edge of the perovskite layer, facilitating interfacial hole transfer. The combination of the above raises the solar cell efficiency from 19.5 to 20.8&#8201;% under 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 illumination, the highest efficiency so far for inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

         <title>Modulating Tri&#8208;mode Emission for Single&#8208;component White Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving single&#8208;component white organic afterglow remains a great challenge owing to the difficulties in simultaneously supporting long&#8208;lived emissions from varied excited states of a molecule for complementary afterglow. Here, an extraordinary tri&#8208;mode emission from the radiative decays of singlet (S  1  ), triplet (T  1  ) and stabilized triplet (T  1  *  ) excited states was proposed to afford white afterglow through modulating the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;  E  ST  ) and exciton trapping depth (  E  TD  ). Low&#8208;lying T  1  *  for yellow afterglow was constructed by H&#8208;aggregation engineering with large  E  TD  and trace isomer doping, while high&#8208;lying T  1  and S  1  for blue afterglow with thermally activated emission feature was realized by reducing &#916;  E  ST  through donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design. Therefore, the single&#8208;component white afterglow with high efficiency of 14.1% and lifetime of 0.61 s was achieved by rationally regulating the afterglow intensity ratios of complementary emissions from S  1  , T  1  and T  1  *  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new strategy for carbon&#8211;carbon bond scission and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes, which was accomplished with a new hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent  1  developed in our laboratory. This novel method delivers medicinally relevant 4&#8208;fully substituted fluoropiperidines in moderate to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Reagent  1  , which has an  N  &#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, was readily synthesized via three steps in 76% overall yield and was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Owing to the presence of a secondary I&#183;&#183;&#183;O bonding interaction between the &#955;  3  &#8208;iodane atom and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of the  N  &#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework,  1  has excellent stability and can be stored at ambient temperature for 6 months without any detectable decomposition. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate that readily combines with a fluoride ion to generate the product.</dc:description>

The difficulties associated with the preparation of these targets prompted the development of various chemical strategies. Nevertheless, the production of these targets remains very challenging or elusive. Recently, we introduced a strategy for one&#8208;pot disulfide bonds formation, tackling most of the previous limitations. Nevertheless, the effect of the order of oxidation remains an underexplored issue. Here we report on the synthetic flexibility and the full rainbow of oxidation orders of three disulfide bonds in targets that lack the knot motif. In contrast, our study reveals an essential order of disulfide bond formation in the EETI&#8208;II knotted miniprotein. This synthetic strategy was straightforwardly applied for the synthesis of novel analogues of the plectasin antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant&amp;nbsp;&lt;italic&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/italic&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;italic&gt;aureus (MRSA)&lt;/italic&gt;, a notorious human pathogen.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>Sn2PO4I: An Excellent Birefringent Material with Giant Optical Anisotropy in Non &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring non &#960;&#8208;conjugated phosphate birefringent crystal with a large birefringence has been a great challenge. Herein, based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), two new compounds, Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I, were designed and synthesized successfully, maintaining the layer structural feature and enhancing the optical anisotropy of crystals. Especially, the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is larger than or equal to 0.664 @546 nm, which is largest among the reported borates and phosphates, even surpassing commercial birefringent crystals YVO4 and TiO2. This work indicates that a breakthrough in birefringence of inorganic compound was achieved. Also, it provides a guiding idea for exploring large birefringence materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Sialylated Glycoforms of Human Erythropoietin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is the main therapeutic glycoprotein for the treatment of anemia in cancer and kidney patients. The&#160;  in vivo  &#160;activity of EPO is carbohydrate&#8208;dependent with the number of sialic acid residues regulating its circulatory half&#8208;life. EPO carries three&#160;  N  &#8208;glycans and thus obtaining pure glycoforms provides a major challenge. We have developed a robust and reproducible chemoenzymatic approach to glycoforms of EPO with and without sialic acids. EPO was assembled by sequential native chemical ligation (NCL) of two peptide and three glycopeptide segments. The glycopeptides were obtained by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted Lansbury&#8208;aspartylation. Enzymatic introduction of the sialic acids was readily accomplished at the level of&#160;the glycopeptide segments&#160;but even more efficiently on the refolded glycoprotein. Biological recognition of the synthetic EPOs was shown by formation of 1:1 complexes with recombinant EPO receptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Molten Salt Electrochemical Modulation of Iron&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur hosts with rationally designed chemistry to confine and convert lithium polysulfides are of prime importance for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. A molten salt electrochemical modulation of iron&#8208;carbon&#8208;nitrogen is herein demonstrated as formation of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with grafted Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@C@Fe3C), which is rationalized as an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Fe3C over nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon contributes to enhanced adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides. The sulfur&#8208;loaded Fe3C@C@Fe3C electrodes hence show a high capacity, good cyclic stability, and enhanced rate performance. This work highlights the unique chemistry of metal carbides on facilitating adsorption&#8208;conversion process of lithium polysulfides, and also extends the scope of molten salt electrolysis to elaboration of energy materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coral&#8208;Like FeP@NC Anode with Increasing Cycle Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Induced by Particle&#8208;Refinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrodes with higher Na  +  storage capability and cycling stability are vital to improve the energy density and rate capability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a coral&#8208;like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen&#8208;doped three&#8208;dimensional carbon framework (   FeP@NC  ).  Due to the highly continuous N&#8208;doped carbon framework and a spring&#8208;buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium  ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at 10 A g  &#8208;1  with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the  FeP nanoparticles  go through a refining&#8208;recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which  results in a gradually  increase  in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na  +  storage and contributes to a rising capacity  with cycling  . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This paper  holds a new feasibility insight  mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.</dc:description>

The reaction proceeds by oxygenation of vinyl magnesium bromide (  component&#8208;I  ) with O  2  (  component&#8208;II  ) to give a magnesium enolate of acetaldehyde, which undergoes addition to a  chiral  N  &#8208;  tert  &#8208;butanesulfinyl imine (  component&#8208;III  ) followed by a sequential addition with excess vinyl magnesium bromide (  component&#8208;IV  ).

         <title>Atomic cation&#8208;vacancy engineering of NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides for improved activity and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) are among the most active catalysts developed to date for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, though their long&#8208;term OER stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we reveal that the stability degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER results from a decreased number of active sites and undesirable phase segregation to form NiOOH and FeOOH, with metal dissolution underpinning both of these deactivation mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of cation&#8208;vacancies in the basal plane of NiFe LDH is an effective approach for achieving both high catalyst activity and stability during OER. The strengthened binding energy between the metals and oxygen in the LDH sheets, together with reduced lattice distortions, both realized by the rational introduction of cation vacancies, drastically mitigate metal dissolution from NiFe&#8208;LDH under high oxidation potentials, resulting in the improved long&#8208;term OER stability. In addition, the cation vacancies (especially M  3+  vacancies) accelerate the evolution of surface  &#947;  &#8208;(NiFe)OOH phases, thereby boosting the OER activity. The present study highlights that tailoring atomic cation&#8208;vacancies is an important strategy for the development of active and stable NiFe&#8208;LDH OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>New Route to Battery Grade NaPF6 for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries: Expanding the Accessible Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems. However, the rapid growth of sodium&#8208;ion battery technology requires a sustainable and scalable synthetic route to high&#8208;grade sodium hexafluorophosphate. This work demonstrates a new multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of NaPF  6  in which the reaction of ammonium hexafluorophosphate with sodium metal in THF solvent generates the electrolyte salt with the absence of the impurities that are common in commercial material. The high purity of the electrolyte (absence of insoluble NaF) allows for concentrations up to 3 M to be obtained accurately in binary carbonate battery solvent. Electrochemical characterization shows that the degradation dynamics of sodium metal&#8211;electrolyte interface are different for more concentrated (&gt;2 M) electrolytes, suggesting that the higher concentration regime (above the conventional 1 M concentration) may be beneficial to battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Sialyl N&#8208;Glycans and Analysis of Their Recognition by Neuraminidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of four fully sialylated tetraantennary  N  &#8208;glycans has been achieved for the first time by using the diacetyl strategy, in which NHAc is tentatively protected as NAc2  to improve the reactivity by preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Another key was the glycosylations to the branched mannose in ether, which promoted the desired glycosylation by stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Furthermore, high &#945;&#8208;selectivity of these glycosylations was realized by utilizing remote participation. Two asymmetrically deuterium&#8208;labeled sialyl  N  &#8208;glycans was also synthesized by the same strategy. The synthesized  N  &#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition. The asymmetrically deuterated  N&#8208;  glycan revealed the difference in recognition of sialic acid on each branch. Meanwhile, the tetraantennary  N  &#8208;glycan was used to evaluate the effect of multivalency and steric hinderance by forming branching structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemistry&#8208;Guided Prediction of the Absolute Configuration of Fungal Reduced Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We performed a focused analysis of functionally related polyketide synthases (PKSs) which produce linear polyketides (PKs) such as prophialotide and other polyhydroxy PKs. The relative and absolute configurations were determined by degradation studies. Based on the results, we propose a stereochemical rule during the chain&#8208;elongation process of the reduced PKs.







Abstract
Highly reducing polyketide synthases (HR&#8208;PKSs) produce structurally diverse polyketides (PKs). The PK diversity is constructed by a variety of factors, including the &#946;&#8208;keto processing, chain length, methylation pattern, and relative and absolute configurations of the substituents. We examined the stereochemical course of the PK processing for the synthesis of polyhydroxy PKs such as phialotides, phomenoic acid, and ACR&#8208;toxin. Heterologous expression of a HR&#8208;PKS gene, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase gene, and a truncated non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase gene resulted in the formation of a linear PK with multiple stereogenic centers. The absolute configurations of the stereogenic centers were determined by chemical degradation followed by comparison of the degradation products with synthetic standards. A stereochemical rule was proposed to explain the absolute configurations of other reduced PKs and highlights an error in the absolute configurations of a reported structure. The present work demonstrates that focused functional analysis of functionally related HR&#8208;PKSs leads to a better understanding of the stereochemical course.

         <title>Effect of Surfactants on the Molecular Structure of the Buried Oil/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The increased ordering of oil molecules' aliphatic chains and the enhanced alignment of water molecules at the oil/water interface was revealed upon increasing adsorption of anionic surfactant using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. The surfactant coverage inducing the highest&#8208;ordered oil molecule configuration at the interface matches a significant reduction of interfacial tension and high emulsion stability.







Abstract
The oil/water interface, for instance in emulsions, is often stabilized by surfactants. Hence, the co&#8208;existence of oil, water, and surfactant molecules at the buried oil/water interface determines macroscopic properties such as surface tension or emulsion stability. Utilizing an inherently surface sensitive spectroscopic method, sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we show that adsorption of an anionic surfactant to the buried oil/water interface increases the magnitude of the interfacial electric field. Meanwhile, the degree of ordering of the interfacial oil molecules increases with the surfactant concentration owing to the intercalation of aliphatic chains of interfacial oil and surfactant molecules. At sufficiently high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial charge reaches a maximum value and the interfacial oil molecules arrange in a fully ordered conformation, a state which coincides with the significant decrease in interfacial tension and increased emulsion stability.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Nitrene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Oxaziridination/1,2&#8208;Alkyl Rearrangement of 1,3&#8208;Diketones toward Bicyclic Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations have been limited to the aziridination of C=C double bonds. In this study, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed oxaziridination of C=O double bonds and achieved a tandem asymmetric oxaziridination/rearrangement reaction of cyclic diketones, affording a series of bicyclic lactams bearing a quaternary carbon center.







Abstract
Although copper&#8208;nitrene has been extensively studied as a versatile active species in various transformations, asymmetric reactions involving copper&#8208;nitrene have been limited to the aziridination of olefins. Herein, we report the novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric oxaziridination reaction of cyclic diketones with alkyl azides and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting highly active intermediate, which produces a synthetically challenging chiral bicyclic lactam containing a quaternary carbon center. This procedure not only enriches the copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions, but also provides an alternative strategy to address the inherent challenges of catalytic asymmetric Schmidt reactions. This unique reaction could inspire the investigation of novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations and their reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Small Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of a bioconjugate is reported. The formation of ring&#8208;like structures was independent of different silica particle types and the amount of peptide conjugated to the material. This novel approach paves the way for further production of functional materials for separation, catalysis, and medical applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly processes guide disordered molecules or particles into long&#8208;range organized structures due to specific supramolecular interactions among the building entities. Herein, we report a unique evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) strategy for four different silica nanoparticle systems obtained through peptide functionalization of the particle surface. First, covalent peptide&#8208;silica coupling was investigated in detail, starting with the grafting of a single amino acid (L&#8208;serine) and expanded to specific small peptides (up to four amino acids) and transferred to different particle types (MCM&#8208;48&#8208;type MSNs, solid nanoparticles, and newly developed virus&#8208;like nanoparticles). These materials were investigated regarding their ability to undergo EISA, which was shown to be independent of particle type and amount of peptide anchored to their surface. This EISA&#8208;based approach provides new possibilities for the design of future advanced drug delivery systems, engineered hierarchical sorbents, and nanocatalyst assemblies.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Nonenzymatic Template&#8208;Directed RNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine X&#8208;ray crystallography and kinetic measurements of modified nucleic acid constructs to determine the requirements for efficient template copying. The 3E conformation of the furanose rings is preferred in the formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Our findings may explain why RNA is a privileged substrate amongst other plausible candidates.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a 3E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.

         <title>Platinum Modulates Redox Properties and 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Adsorption Kinetics of Ni(OH)2 for Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt is proven to be an effective accelerator to Ni(OH)2 for catalyzing HMF oxidation reaction. Pt optimizes the surface electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 and accelerates the formation of the active Ni(OH)O species. Besides, it optimizes the adsorption mode of HMF and reduces the adsorption energy.







Abstract
Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)2 is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)2 electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)2 electrode. Operando methods reveal that the introduction of Pt optimized the redox property of Ni(OH)2 and accelerate the formation of Ni(OH)O during the catalytic process. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the enhanced Ni(OH)O formation kinetics originates from the reduced dehydrogenation energy of Ni(OH)2. The product analysis and transition state simulation prove that the Pt also reduces adsorption energy of HMF with optimized adsorption behavior as Pt can act as the adsorption site of HMF. Overall, this work here provides a strategy to design an efficient and universal nickel&#8208;based catalyst for HMF electro&#8208;oxidation, which can also be extended to other Ni&#8208;based catalysts such as Ni(HCO3)2 and NiO.

         <title>Luminescent Behavior Elucidation of a Disilane&#8208;Bridged D&#8211;A&#8211;D Triad Composed of Phenothiazine and Thienopyrazine</title>

Abstract
A &#963;&#8211;&#960; extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8722;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8722;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together. A built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is thus formed, which triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved.







Abstract
A built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO3&#8722; ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO3RR). A model electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed . This built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also raises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower the energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved, which are all the best among studies reported at 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of nitrate concentration to date.

         <title>2D Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Multidimensional Photocatalysts for Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porphyrinic nanosheets were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts to mediate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization of different monomers under a broad range of light wavelengths. This system exhibits oxygen tolerance and temporal control resulting in the preparation of well&#8208;defined polymers. Nanosheets were utilized to catalyze stereolithographic 3D printing, providing reinforced mechanical properties and effective antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
Ultrathin porphyrinic 2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets (TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetra&#8208;4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light. High polymerization rates, oxygen tolerance, and precise temporal control were achieved. The polymers showed narrow molecular weight distributions and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were applied as photocatalysts in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open&#8208;air environment under blue light to yield well&#8208;defined 3D printed objects. Apart from providing an efficient catalytic system, 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets reinforced the mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials. The presence of ZnTCPP embedded in the materials conferred effective antimicrobial activity under visible light by production of singlet oxygen, affording 98&#8201;% and 93&#8201;% anti&#8208;bacterial efficiency against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, respectively.

         <title>Compressive Strain Modulation of Single Iron Sites on Helical Carbon Support Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites could boost the catalytic activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high&#8208;curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self&#8208;assembled chiral surfactants. The high&#8208;curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites with 1.5&#8201;% compressed Fe&#8722;N bonds exhibit downshifted d&#8208;band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three&#8208;dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.

         <title>Insights into the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes through Multispectral Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations is used to obtain new insights into the ionic conduction mechanism, the nature of the solvent molecules, and the interactions among different components in quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) composed of Li salts, polymer matrix, and solvent, are beneficial for improving the security and energy density of batteries. However, the ionic conduction mechanism, existential form of solvent molecules, and interactions between different components of QPE remain unclear. Here we develop a multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations to unravel aforesaid mysteries. The results indicate that the existential state of solvent in QPE is quite different from that in liquid electrolyte. The Li cations in gel polymer electrolyte are fully solvated by partial solvent molecules to form a local high concentration of Li+, while the other solvent molecules are fastened by polymer matrix in QPE. As a result, the solvation structure and conduction mechanism of Li+ are similar to those in high&#8208;concentrated liquid electrolyte. This work provides a new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of QPE and will promote its application for safe and high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond mediated supramolecular assembly with chiral fractal structure is demonstrated in axially chiral pyridine&#8208;based molecules and 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene. The assembly shows asymmetry amplification both in ground state and excited state, and the enhancement of the chirality can be assigned to the hierarchical chirality transfer from molecule to chiral fractal structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to their great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self&#8208;assembly, it remains unknown how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self&#8208;assembly via halogen bonds, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co&#8208;assemble with an achiral 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (F4DIB) and well&#8208;ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometer scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.

     alt="Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A halogen bond mediated supramolecular assembly with chiral fractal structure is demonstrated in axially chiral pyridine-based molecules and 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene. The assembly shows asymmetry amplification both in ground state and excited state, and the enhancement of the chirality can be assigned to the hierarchical chirality transfer from molecule to chiral fractal structure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to their great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self-assembly, it remains unknown how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self-assembly via halogen bonds, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co-assemble with an achiral 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene (&lt;b&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;DIB)&lt;/b&gt; and well-ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometer scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interpenetration Symmetry Control Within Ultramicroporous Robust Boron Cluster Hybrid MOFs for Benchmark Purification of Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented symmetrically interpenetrated boron cluster pillared MOF was prepared to address the industrially important but challenging C2H2/CO2 separation with large C2H2 capacity (76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 selectivity (56.6), modestly high adsorption heat (54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and high practical C2H2 (&gt;99.5&#8201;% purity) productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) owing to the precise control of interpenetration symmetry.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is an important process in industry but challenged by the trade&#8208;off of capacity and selectivity owning to their similar physical properties and identical kinetic molecular size. We report the first example of symmetrically interpenetrated dodecaborate pillared MOF, ZNU&#8208;1, for benchmark selective separation of C2H2 from CO2 with a high C2H2 capacity of 76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and record C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 56.6 (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar) among all the robust porous materials without open metal sites. Single crystal structure analysis and modeling indicated that the interpenetration shifting from asymmetric to symmetric mode provided optimal pore chemistry with ideal synergistic &#8220;2+2&#8221; dihydrogen bonding sites for tight C2H2 trapping. The exceptional separation performance was further evidenced by simulated and experimental breakthroughs with excellent recyclability and high productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of 99.5&#8201;% purity C2H2 during stepped desorption process.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Material Based on Catechol&#8208;Modified Self&#8208;Immolative Poly(Disulfide) Backbones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21543-21549, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol&#8208;functionalized self&#8208;immolative poly(disulfides) are synthesized and fashioned into dual&#8208;responsive gels through formation of catecholato&#8211;Al3+ cross&#8208;links. Two distinct pathways to cargo release are engineered, namely the depolymerization in a self&#8208;immolative fashion, or breaking catecholato&#8211;Al3+ cross&#8208;links at low pH. Both gel degradation pathways lead to release of bound dye molecules on demand.







Abstract
Functional materials engineered to degrade upon triggering are in high demand due their potentially lower impact on the environment as well as their use in sensing and in medical applications. Here, stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are prepared by decorating a self&#8208;immolative poly(dithiothreitol) backbone with pendant catechol units. The highly functional polymer is fashioned into stimuli&#8208;responsive gels, formed through pH&#8208;dependent catecholato&#8211;metal ion cross&#8208;links. The gels degrade in response to specific environmental changes, either by addressing the pH responsive, non&#8208;covalent, catecholato&#8211;metal complexes, or by addition of a thiol. The latter stimulus triggers end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization of the entire self&#8208;immolative backbone through end&#8208;cap replacement via thiol&#8211;disufide exchanges. Gel degradation is visualized by release of a dye from the supramolecular gel as it itself is converted into smaller molecules.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Spin Interactions in One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of a Cumulene&#8208;Based Singlet Biradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21319-21326, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet biradical based on [5]cumulene end&#8208;capped with phenalenyl moieties was synthesized. The strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking tendency of phenalenyl units led to controlled self&#8208;assembly, with the formation of one&#8208;dimensional chain assemblies. Variable&#8208;temperature structural and Raman spectroscopic studies demonstrated that intramolecular spin pairs forming cumulene bonds coupled intermolecularly to form a continuum spin system at low temperatures (see picture).







Abstract
The synthesis of phenalenyl&#8208;endcapped [5]cumulene as a cumulene&#8208;based singlet biradical and the spin correlation changes of one&#8208;dimensional aggregates are described. The high propensity for self&#8208;aggregation of phenalenyl rings and the introduction of bulky substituents into the appropriate positions led to the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional chain assembly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis indicated that the bond length alternation of the cumulene chain increased with decreasing temperature, along with improved overlapping of the phenalenyl rings. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that a localized spin pair within the molecule decouples at low temperatures, and a continuum spin system involving intra&#8208; and intermolecular spin&#8211;spin interactions emerges in the one&#8208;dimensional chain.

         <title>Effective and Rapid Removal of Polar Organic Micropollutants from Water by Amide Naphthotube&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21404-21411, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing the biomimetic macrocyclic hosts, amide naphthotubes, are able to effectively and rapidly adsorb polar organic micropollutants from water by employing host&#8211;guest binding. The polymers can be readily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH at room temperature.







Abstract
It is challenging to remove polar organic micropollutants from water through adsorption&#8208;mediated processes. Macrocycle&#8208;crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8211;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts. In this research, we report two amide naphthotube&#8208;crosslinked polymers which can effectively and rapidly adsorb a wide scope of polar organic micropollutants from water through biomimetic molecular recognition. Amide naphthotubes possess hydrogen bonding sites in their deep hydrophobic cavities and can effectively bind polar organic micropollutants in water through the hydrophobic effects and shielded hydrogen bonds. The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing amide naphthotubes are even able to remove a complex mixture of organic micropollutants from water and the used materials can be easily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH. This research provides a solution for the treatment of polar organic micropollutants by using biomimetic molecular recognition in water.

         <title>Nanomediator&#8211;Effector Cascade Systems for Amplified Protein Kinase Activity Imaging and Phosphorylation&#8208;Induced Drug Release In Vivo</title>

We propose a nanomediator&#8211;effector cascade system that can convert the subtle events of kinase&#8208;regulated phosphorylation to augmented fluorescence recovery and cargo release via the DNA amplification machinery. This kinase&#8208;specific sensing and treating modality allows kinase activity imaging and cellular signaling&#8208;responsive drug release in vivo.







Abstract
Protein kinases constitute a rich pool of biomarkers and therapeutic targets of tremendous diseases including cancer. However, sensing kinase activity in vivo while implementing treatments according to kinase hyperactivation remains challenging. Herein, we present a nanomediator&#8211;effector cascade system that can in situ magnify the subtle events of kinase&#8208;catalyzed phosphorylation via DNA amplification machinery to achieve kinase activity imaging and kinase&#8208;responsive drug release in vivo. In this cascade, the phosphorylation&#8208;mediated disassembly of DNA/peptide complex on the nanomediators initiated the detachment of fluorescent hairpin DNAs from the nanoeffectors via hybridization chain reaction (HCR), leading to fluorescence recovery and therapeutic cargo release. We demonstrated that this nanosystem simultaneously enabled trace protein kinase A (PKA) activity imaging and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for inhibition of tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, affording a kinase&#8208;specific sense&#8208;and&#8208;treat paradigm for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Tracking and Sensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ with a Single SERS Probe in the Live Brain: Toward Understanding Why Copper Ions Were Increased upon Ischemia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21351-21359, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SERS sensor was created for biosensing extracellular concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ simultaneously in the live brain. Using our powerful tool, three routes were discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ during ischemia: Cu+ and Cu2+ were transported from neurons; Cu+ and Cu2+ were released from the destroyed copper&#8208;containing proteins; and Cu+ was converted into Cu2+.







Abstract
The imbalance of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the brain is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases. However, it still lacks of effective analytical methods for simultaneously determining the concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+. Herein, we created a novel SERS probe (CuSP) to real&#8208;time track and accurately quantify extracellular concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the live brain. The present CuSP probe demonstrated specific ability for recognition of Cu+ and Cu2+ in a dual&#8208;recognition mode. Then, a microarray consisting of 8 CuSP probes with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution and good accuracy was constructed for tracking and simultaneously biosensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the cerebral cortex of living brain. Using our powerful tool, it was found that that the concentrations of Cu2+ and Cu+ were increased by &#8776;4.26 and &#8776;1.80 times upon ischemia, respectively. Three routes were first discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ during ischemia.

         <title>A Nonheme Mononuclear {FeNO}7 Complex that Produces N2O in the Absence of an Exogenous Reductant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21558-21564, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first example of a nonheme, mononuclear {FeNO}7 complex that mediates the conversion of NO to N2O in the absence of an external reductant. A new mononuclear, 5&#8208;coordinate FeII complex is synthesized, which binds nitric oxide to form the {FeNO}7 complex. This complex exhibits a highly activated NO ligand as seen by RR spectroscopy, and generates N2O in THF upon addition of H2O.







Abstract
A new nonheme iron(II) complex, FeII(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (1), is reported. Reaction of 1 with NO(g) gives a stable mononitrosyl complex Fe(NO)(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (2), which was characterized by M&#246;ssbauer (&#948;=0.52&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1, |&#916;EQ|=0.80&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1), EPR (S=3/2), resonance Raman (RR) and Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The data show that 2 is an {FeNO}7 complex with an S=3/2 spin ground state. The RR spectrum (&#955;exc=458&#8197;nm) of 2 combined with isotopic labeling (15N, 18O) reveals &#957;(N&#8208;O)=1680&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is highly activated, and is a nearly identical match to that seen for the reactive mononitrosyl intermediate in the nonheme iron enzyme FDPnor (&#957;(NO)=1681&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Complex 2 reacts rapidly with H2O in THF to produce the N&#8208;N coupled product N2O, providing the first example of a mononuclear nonheme iron complex that is capable of converting NO to N2O in the absence of an exogenous reductant.

         <title>Asymmetric Enamide&#8211;Imine Tautomerism in the Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21334-21339, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;amido tertiary allyl alcohols through chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;imine tautomerism is reported. Both dialkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;disubstituted allyl alcohols were compatible with this protocol, generating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imines and enamides with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient protocol for kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols has been developed through an unprecedented asymmetric enamide&#8208;imine tautomerism process enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A broad range of racemic 2&#8208;arylsulfonamido tertiary allyl alcohols could be kinetically resolved with excellent kinetic resolution performances (with s&#8208;factor up to &gt;200). This method is particularly effective for a series of 1,1&#8208;dialkyl substituted allyl alcohols, which produced chiral tertiary alcohols that would be difficult to access via other asymmetric methods. Facile and versatile transformations of the chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imine and enamide products, especially the efficient stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino tertiary alcohols using one enantiomer of the catalyst, demonstrated the value of this kinetic resolution method.

Energy levels of perovskite nanocrystallites depend on their size owing to quantum confinement and the concurrent yet distinct phenomenon of size&#8208;dependent structural changes where surface perturbations template the core. This effect can aid in the design of perovskite opto&#8208;electronic devices utilizing mesoporous layers to tailor the size of infiltrated nanocrystallites.







Abstract
A comprehensive picture explaining the effect of the crystal size in metal halide perovskite films on their opto&#8208;electronic characteristics is currently lacking. We report that perovskite nanocrystallites exhibit a wider band gap due to concurrent quantum confinement and size dependent structural effects, with the latter being remarkably distinct and attributed to the perturbation from the surface of the nanocrystallites affecting the structure of their core. This phenomenon might assist in the photo&#8208;induced charge separation within the perovskite in devices employing mesoporous layers as they restrict the size of nanocrystallites present in them. We demonstrate that the crystal size effect is widely applicable as it is ubiquitous in different compositions and deposition methods employed in the fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells. This effect is a convenient and effective way to tune the band gap of perovskites.

         <title>Direct Detection of Surface Species Formed on Iridium Electrocatalysts during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

An approach to directly examine the oxidation state and surface composition of nanosized Ir electrodes after oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was developed. Atom probe tomography reveals compositional changes in the topmost surface and subsurface on various Ir planes during OER. This approach provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into surface changes during electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. Herein, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm of (024), (026), (113), and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8722;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick subsurface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8722;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8722;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.

A nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay strategy combines radical rearrangement and cross&#8208;coupling via a C(sp3)&#8208;centred radical, to produce valuable phenylalanine derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access. An N&#8208;benzyl amino acid ester functions as a molecular scaffold for the aryl migration reaction. The synthetic method offers mild reaction conditions, high diastereoselectivity, and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented, efficient nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay for the remote cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of &#946;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;benzylamino acid esters with aryl bromides via 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/arylation cascades. &#946;&#8208;Bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;benzylamino acid esters are considered as unique molecular scaffolds allowing for aryl migration reactions, which are conceptually novel variants for the radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement. This reaction enables the formation of two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds using a bench&#8208;stable Ni/bipyridine/Zn system featuring a broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity, which provides an effective platform for the remote aryl group migration and arylation of amino acid esters via redox&#8208;neutral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond cleavage. Mechanistically, this cascade reaction is accomplished by combining two powerful catalytic cycles consisting of a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and radical 1,4&#8208;aryl migration through the generation of C(sp3)&#8208;centred radical intermediates from the homolysis of C(sp3)&#8722;Br bonds and the switching of the transient alkyl radical into a robust &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

Four types of novel and complicated spiropyrazolones from pyrazolidinones and diazopyrazolones were constructed via a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation route, especially a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade and a novel tandem C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, and diazopyrazolones acted as unexpected 1C synthons.







Abstract
A catalytic system&#8208;controlled divergent reaction strategy was here reported to construct four types of intriguing spiroheterocyclic skeletons from simple and readily available starting materials via a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade. The tetraazaspiroheterocyclic and trizazspiroheterocyclic scaffolds could be independently constructed by a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade, a C(sp2)&#8208;H activation/[4+1] annulation and a novel tandem C(sp2)&#8208;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, along with a broad scope of substrates, moderate to excellent yields and valuable transformations. More importantly, in these transformations, we are the first time to capture a N&#8722;N bond activation and a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation of pyrazolidinones under different catalytic system.

         <title>Fluoride Chemistry in Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21583-21591, September 20, 2021. </description>

Fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites improves the crystallization process. Fluoride anions selectively coordinate and remove SnIV and affect the colloidal properties in solution. This study describes the working mechanism of SnF2 and highlights the importance of solution chemistry for controlling crystallization and SnII oxidation in tin halide perovskites.







Abstract
Tin is the frontrunner for substituting toxic lead in perovskite solar cells. However, tin suffers the detrimental oxidation of SnII to SnIV. Most of reported strategies employ SnF2 in the perovskite precursor solution to prevent SnIV formation. Nevertheless, the working mechanism of this additive remains debated. To further elucidate it, we investigate the fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites by complementary analytical tools. NMR analysis of the precursor solution discloses a strong preferential affinity of fluoride anions for SnIV over SnII, selectively complexing it as SnF4. Hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on films shows the lower tendency of SnF4 than SnI4 to get included in the perovskite structure, hence preventing the inclusion of SnIV in the film. Finally, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the strong influence of fluoride on the colloidal chemistry of precursor dispersions, directly affecting perovskite crystallization.

NMR analysis of the precursor solution discloses a strong preferential affinity of fluoride anions for Sn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; over Sn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, selectively complexing it as SnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on films shows the lower tendency of SnF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; than SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to get included in the perovskite structure, hence preventing the inclusion of Sn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; in the film. Finally, small-angle X-ray scattering reveals the strong influence of fluoride on the colloidal chemistry of precursor dispersions, directly affecting perovskite crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MnO2 Electrocatalysts Coordinating Alcohol Oxidation for Ultra&#8208;Durable Hydrogen and Chemical Productions in Acidic Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21464-21472, September 20, 2021. </description>

This work reports a strategy of using a low&#8208;cost acidic aqueous solution of alcohols for efficient hydrogen/chemical co&#8208;production. The as&#8208;prepared non&#8208;precious metal MnO2/carbon paper electrocatalyst in combination with alcohol oxidation demonstrates a significantly decreased total energy input for hydrogen production and ultra&#8208;high durability in acidic electrolytes.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen production under acidic conditions is of great importance for industrialization in comparison to that in alkaline media, which, unfortunately, still remains challenging due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant, cost&#8208;effective and highly active anodic electrocatalysts that can be used durably under strongly acidic conditions. Here we report an unexpected finding that manganese oxide, a kind of common non&#8208;noble catalysts easily soluble in acidic solutions, can be applied as a highly efficient and extremely durable anodic electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from an acidic aqueous solution of alcohols. Particularly in a glycerol solution, a potential of as low as 1.36&#8197;V (vs. RHE) is needed at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 270&#8197;mV lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to oxidize glycerol into value&#8208;added chemicals such as formic acid, without oxygen production. To our surprise, the manganese oxide exhibits extremely high stability for electrocatalytic hydrogen production in coupling with glycerol oxidation for longer than 865 hours compared to shorter than 10&#8197;h for OER. Moreover, the effect of the addition of glycerol on the electrochemical durability has been probed via in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work demonstrates that acid&#8208;unstable metal oxide electrocatalysts can be used robustly in acidic media under the presence of certain substances for electrochemical purposes, such as hydrogen production.

Well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance, and diffusive capacity are achieved from the CV curves of typical electrode materials for metal&#8208;ion batteries after three successive treatments including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background as well as non&#8208;linear fitting calculation, offering a more rational and reliable method to calculate the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution.







Abstract
Noticeable pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior out of charge storage mechanism (CSM) has attracted intensive studies because it can provide both high energy density and large output power. Although cyclic voltammetry is recognized as the feasible electrochemical technique to determine it quantitatively in the previous works, the results are inferior due to uncertainty in the definitions and application conditions. Herein, three successive treatments, including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background, as well as a non&#8208;linear fitting algorithm are employed for the first time to calibrate the different CSM contribution of three typical cathode materials, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, and achieve well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance and diffusive contributions to the total capacity. This work can eliminate misunderstanding concepts and correct ambiguous results of the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and recognize the essence of CSM in electrode materials.

         <title>Biomimetic Iron Complex Achieves TET Enzyme Reactivity**

The synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ serves as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and short oligonucleotide strands serve as substrates. The 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably and highly selectively by the complex.







Abstract
The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine (5mdC) is the most prevalent modification to DNA. It is removed inter alia via an active demethylation pathway: oxidation by Ten&#8208;Eleven Translocation 5&#8208;methyl cytosine dioxygenase (TET) and subsequent removal via base excision repair or direct demodification. Recently, we have shown that the synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can serve as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and even short oligonucleotide strands can also serve as substrates, using a range of HPLC and MS techniques. We found that the 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably by 1, with side reactions occurring only at the strand ends of the used oligonucleotides. A detailed study of the reactivity of 1 towards nucleosides confirms our results; that oxidation of the anomeric center (1&#8242;) is the most common side reaction.

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>

In the current study, with the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic techniques, transient kinetic analysis, and implementation of robust experimental methodologies, we resolve the nature of catalytic active sites and reaction mechanism for oxidative coupling of methane over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.







Abstract
The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of in situ Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe (H2&#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na2WO4 active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable surface Na&#8208;WOx sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (i) surface Na&#8208;WOx sites are responsible for selectively activating CH4 to C2Hx and over&#8208;oxidizing CHy to CO and (ii) molten Na2WO4 phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.

         <title>Tuning the Circular Dichroism and Circular Polarized Luminescence Intensities of Chiral 2D Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites through Halogenation of the Organic Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21434-21440, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the incorporation of Cl&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the chiroptical properties of 2D chiral perovskites can be significantly enhanced. The observed circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence intensities are found to be associated with the d&#8208;spacing of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites and the strength of the halogen&#8211;halogen interaction within the system.







Abstract
Through the incorporation of various halogen&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the effects of chiral molecules on the chiroptical properties of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are investigated. Among them, the HOIP having a Cl&#8208;substituted chiral cation exhibits the highest circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) intensities, indicating the existence of the largest rotatory strength, whereas the F&#8208;substituted HIOP shows the weakest intensities. The observed modulation can be correlated to the varied magnetic transition dipole of HOIPs, which is sensitive to the d&#8208;spacing between inorganic layers and the halogen&#8211;halogen interaction between organic cations and the inorganic sheets. These counteracting effects meet the optimal CD and CPL intensity with chlorine substitution, rendering the rotatory strength of HOIPs arranged in the order of (ClMBA)2PbI4&gt;(BrMBA)2PbI4&gt;(IMBA)2PbI4&gt;(MBA)2PbI4&gt;(FMBA)2PbI4.

         <title>Highly Efficient Oxidative Cyanation of Aldehydes to Nitriles over Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21479-21485, September 20, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8208;free Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000) show high activity and selectivity for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes to synthesize organic nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource. Other oxidizable groups were tolerated, and no further reaction of the product was observed over Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000.







Abstract
Oxidative cyanation of aldehydes provides a promising strategy for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of organic nitriles. Design of robust and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is the key for this route. Herein, we designed a series of Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with a hierarchical porous structure (denoted as Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;x, x represents the pyrolysis temperature). It was found that the obtained Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 was very selective and efficient for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes including those containing other oxidizable groups into the corresponding nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource below 100&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed investigations revealed that the excellent performance of Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 originated mainly from the graphitic&#8208;N species with lower electron density and synergistic effect between the Se, S, N, and C in the catalyst. Besides, the hierarchically porous structure could also promote the reaction. Notably, the unique feature of this metal&#8208;free catalyst is that it tolerated other oxidizable groups, and showed no activity on further reaction of the products, thereby resulting in high selectivity. As far as we know, this is the first work for the synthesis of nitriles via oxidative cyanation of aldehydes over heterogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Construction of Chiral Azepine Skeleton Bearing Multiple&#8208;Stereogenic Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21486-21493, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution was developed. With this methodology, four types of stereogenic elements including chiral nitrogen center, C&#8722;N axial chirality, C&#8722;C axial chirality and conformational behavior of the seven&#8208;membered ring were stereoselectively constructed.







Abstract
Enantioselective construction of molecules bearing multiple stereogenic elements is increasingly related to the synthesis of enantiopure natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. However, atom&#8208;economical and enantioselective approaches to install multiple stereogenic elements in a small molecular template by limited chemical transformation remain challenging. We describe an organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules bearing four types of stereogenic elements in fused azepines via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution. This method was proved robust with a wide range of substrate scope (46&#8211;92&#8201;% yield), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) and enantioselectivity achieved (up to 97&#8201;% ee). Optical properties and Ru3+&#8208;induced fluorescence responses of these compounds suggest their potential applications in optoelectronic materials and heavy metal ion detection.

The ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was elucidated for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported thiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal nanoculusters (NCs) using five experimental techniques. Furthermore, based on obtained knowledge, a method was established to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation, thereby succeeding in creating a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability.







Abstract
Recently, the creation of new heterogeneous catalysts using the unique electronic/geometric structures of small metal nanoclusters (NCs) has received considerable attention. However, to achieve this, it is extremely important to establish methods to remove the ligands from ligand&#8208;protected metal NCs while preventing the aggregation of metal NCs. In this study, the ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was followed for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal NCs using five experimental techniques. The results clearly demonstrate that the ligand&#8208;desorption process consists of ligand dissociation on the surface of the metal NCs, adsorption of the generated compounds on the support and desorption of the compounds from the support, and the temperatures at which these processes occurred were elucidated. Based on the obtained knowledge, we established a method to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation, thereby succeeding in creating a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability.

The transient nucleophilic enolate species is intercepted by TrpB, which facilitates selective C&#8722;C bond formation, resulting in the asymmetric alkylation of ketones such as propiophenone and 2&#8208;fluoroacetophenone. The products spontaneously cyclize to form highly substituted nitrogen heterocycles that can be reduced to form proline analogs.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase (TrpB) catalyzes a PLP&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;substitution reaction between indole and serine to form L&#8208;Trp. A succession of TrpB protein engineering campaigns to expand the enzyme's nucleophile substrate range has enabled the biocatalytic production of diverse non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs). Here, we show that ketone&#8208;derived enolates can serve as nucleophiles in the TrpB reaction to achieve the asymmetric alkylation of ketones, an outstanding challenge in synthetic chemistry. We engineered TrpB by directed evolution to catalyze the asymmetric alkylation of propiophenone and 2&#8208;fluoroacetophenone with a high degree of selectivity. In reactions with propiophenone, preference for the opposite product diastereomer emerges over the course of evolution, demonstrating that full control over the stereochemistry at the new chiral center can be achieved. The addition of this new reaction to the TrpB platform is a crucial first step toward the development of efficient methods to synthesize non&#8208;canonical prolines and other chirally dense nitrogen heterocycles.

&lt;p&gt;Ketone-derived enolates can serve as nucleophiles for tryptophan synthase &#946;-subunit (TrpB) catalysed reactions. The transient nucleophilic enolate species is intercepted by TrpB, which facilitates selective C&#8722;C bond formation, resulting in the asymmetric alkylation of ketones such as propiophenone and 2-fluoroacetophenone. The products spontaneously cyclize to form highly substituted nitrogen heterocycles that can be reduced to form proline analogs.

         <title>Designable Assembly of Aluminum Molecular Rings for Sequential Confinement of Iodine Molecules</title>

Heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions, and conjugated carboxylate ligands act as adsorbents for the sequential confinement of iodine molecules. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8211;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.







Abstract
Although numerous adsorbent materials have been reported for the capture of radioactive iodine, there is still demand for new absorbents that are economically viable and can be prepared by reliable synthetic protocols. Herein, we report a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy towards adsorbents for the sequential confinement of iodine molecules. These adsorbents are versatile heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions, and conjugated carboxylate ligands. Additionally, these materials can quickly remove iodine from cyclohexane solutions with a high removal rate (98.8&#8201;%) and considerable loading capacity (555.06&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). These heterometallic frameworks provided distinct pore sizes and binding sites for iodine molecules, and the sequential confinement of iodine molecules was supported by crystallographic data. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8211;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.

The combination of the conceptually complementary formal ring distortion&#8208; and pseudo&#8208;natural product strategies yields novel natural product&#8208;inspired bioactive pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids. 







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new natural product&#8208;inspired compound class obtained by combining the conceptually complementary pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) design strategy and a formal adaptation of the complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity ring distortion approach. Fragment&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;sesquiterpene lactones, whose scaffolds can formally be viewed as related to each other or are obtained by ring distortion, were combined with alkaloid&#8208;derived pyrrolidine fragments by means of highly selective stereocomplementary 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. The resulting pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids were found to be both chemically and biologically diverse, and their biological performance distinctly depends on both the structure of the sesquiterpene lactone&#8208;derived scaffolds and the stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine fragment. Biological investigation of the compound collection led to the discovery of a novel chemotype inhibiting Hedgehog&#8208;dependent osteoblast differentiation

We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. {BiW8} suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MG63 cells. We identified POM&#8208;induced pyroptosis for the first time. Decreased GSH content and increased ROS levels were observed in {BiW8}&#8208;treated cells. {BiW8} executed multiple antitumor mechanisms, such as activation of pyroptosis, regulation of oxidative stress, and inhibition of DNA repair.







Abstract
We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. At 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, the IC50 values of {BiW8} against HUVEC, MG63, RD, Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF7 cells were 895.8, 127.3, 344.3, 455.0, 781.3, and 206.3&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The IC50 value of {BiW8} on the MG63 cells was more than 2&#8208;fold lower than that of the other raw materials. Through morphological and functional features, we demonstrated pyroptosis as a newly identified mechanism of cell death induced by {BiW8}. {BiW8} increased 2&#8208;fold reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MG63 cells at 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation. Compared with 0&#8197;h, the glutathione (GSH) content decreased by 59, 65, 75, 94, and 97&#8201;% at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, respectively. Furthermore, multiple antitumor mechanisms of {BiW8} were identified via transcriptome analysis and chemical simulation, including activation of pyroptosis, suppression of GSH generation, depletion of GSH, and inhibition of DNA repair.

A scalable low&#8208;temperature molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted method was developed for synthesis of WS2 nanosheets with high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;yield. The WS2 nanosheets show high electrocatalytic activity towards the alkaline sulfion (S2&#8722;) oxidation reaction and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid alkali&#8208;acid electrochemical device was set up for electrolytic H2 generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion.







Abstract
WS2 nanosheets hold great promise for a variety of applications yet faces a grand challenge in terms of large&#8208;scale synthesis. We report a reliable, scalable, and high&#8208;yield (&gt;93&#8201;%) synthetic strategy to fabricate WS2 nanosheets, which exhibit highly desirable electrocatalytic properties toward both the alkaline sulfion (S2&#8722;) oxidation reaction (SOR) and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings prompted us to develop a hybrid alkali&#8208;acid electrochemical cell with the WS2 nanosheets as bifunctional electrode catalysts of alkaline anodic SOR and acidic cathodic HER. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device holds promise for self&#8208;power or low&#8208;electricity electrolytic H2 generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.

We report a reliable, scalable, and high-yield (&amp;gt;93&#8201;%) synthetic strategy to fabricate WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets, which exhibit highly desirable electrocatalytic properties toward both the alkaline sulfion (S&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) oxidation reaction (SOR) and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings prompted us to develop a hybrid alkali-acid electrochemical cell with the WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets as bifunctional electrode catalysts of alkaline anodic SOR and acidic cathodic HER. The proof-of-concept device holds promise for self-power or low-electricity electrolytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintained for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21575-21582, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
When an electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on cubic CoSe2 was doped with the light element nitrogen, the electronic structure was modulated while the highly symmetric crystal structure phase was maintained. This nitrogen&#8208;doped CoSe2 shows enhanced alkaline HER electrocatalytic activity, while no structural reconstruction occurs during the HER process.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms is one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS&#8208;TMC), the introduction of heteroatoms, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during the catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between the intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that nitrogen incorporation can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS&#8208;TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution activity (HER). In contrast, the introduction of phosphorus can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus&#8208;doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER.

         <title>Chiral Arylated Amines via C&#8722;N Coupling of Chiral Amines with Aryl Bromides Promoted by Light</title>

A stereoretentive C&#8722;N coupling of optically active amines and amino acid esters with aryl bromides is achieved by nickel catalysis under light irradiation, without the use of any external photosensitizers. 







Abstract
The Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8208;N coupling reaction has found widespread applications in organic synthesis. Over the past two decades or so, many improved catalysts have been introduced, allowing various amines and aryl electrophiles to be readily used nowadays. However, there lacks a protocol that could be used to couple a wide range of chiral amines and aryl halides, without erosion of the enantiomeric excess (ee). Reported in this article is a method based on molecular Ni catalysis driven by light, which enables stereoretentive C&#8208;N coupling of optically active amines, amino alcohols, and amino acid esters with aryl bromides, with no need for any external photosensitizer. The method is effective for a wide variety of coupling partners, including those bearing functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles, thus providing a viable alternative to accessing synthetically important chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids esters. Its viability is demonstrated by 92 examples with up to 99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>An Efficient Diazirine&#8208;Based Four&#8208;Armed Cross&#8208;linker for Photo&#8208;patterning of Polymeric Semiconductors</title>

A tetra&#8208;diazirine based cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) is developed for the universal patterning of p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar conjugated polymers by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. The interchain packing orders, the thin film morphologies and the charge carrier mobilities of four conjugated polymers are retained after patterning.







Abstract
A diazirine&#8208;based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) with a tetrahedron geometry is presented for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. After blending of 4CNN with no more than 3&#8201;% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was achieved; regular patterns with size as small as 5&#8197;&#956;m were prepared with appropriate photomasks after 365&#8197;nm irradiation for just 40&#8197;s. The interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking and the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. A complementary&#8208;like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo&#8208;patterning of the p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. The results show that 4CNN is a new generation of cross&#8208;linker for the photo&#8208;patterning of polymeric semiconductors for all&#8208;solution&#8208;processible flexible electronic devices.

A heteroarchitecture of MoS2&#8208;CNTs was developed in which CNTs are vertically anchored within MoS2 by a C&#8722;Mo covalent bond. Due to the high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ion&#8208;diffusion channels, and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs show high energy density and large capacitance, which can power wearable health&#8208;monitoring devices efficiently.







Abstract
Advanced two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets that promote the dynamic transportation and storage capacity of ions are significant for high&#8208;performance electrochemical capacitors (ECs). However, such materials often possess a low energy density. We have developed an ordered heteroarchitecture of molybdenum disulfide&#8208;carbon nanotubes (MoS2&#8208;CNTs) in which CNTs are vertically grafted within a MoS2 framework by C&#8722;Mo covalent bonds. Benefiting from this in&#8197;situ vertical bridge, high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ion&#8208;diffusion channels and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the MoS2&#8208;CNTs presents ultralarge capacitance (5485&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) and good structural stability in potassium hydroxide electrolyte. Moreover, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs obtained through direct&#8208;write printing construction deliver high energy density (226&#8197;mWh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good capacitance (723&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) and stable high/low&#8208;temperature operating ability, which can power a wearable health&#8208;monitoring device.

The dielectric constants of solutions at different temperatures and compositions are comprehensively probed by considering the significant role in regulating solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation structures of working liquid electrolytes.







Abstract
The dielectric constant is a crucial physicochemical property of liquids in tuning solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation microstructures. Herein the dielectric constant variation of liquid electrolytes regarding to temperatures and electrolyte compositions is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants of solvents reduce as temperatures increase due to accelerated mobility of molecules. For solvent mixtures with different mixing ratios, their dielectric constants either follow a linear superposition rule or satisfy a polynomial function, depending on weak or strong intermolecular interactions. Dielectric constants of electrolytes exhibit a volcano trend with increasing salt concentrations, which can be attributed to dielectric contributions from salts and formation of solvation structures. This work affords an atomic insight into the dielectric constant variation and its chemical origin, which can deepen the fundamental understanding of solution chemistry.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glasses with Lava and Healing Ability for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sieving</title>

Four coordination polymers with good flowability at low vitrification temperature were developed and fabricated into high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes by hot&#8208;casting or hot&#8208;pressing methods. The obtained membranes show excellent H2 sieving ability, rivaling against the best&#8208;reported gas separation membranes. The cracks and functions of the broken membranes can be easily healed upon heating.







Abstract
Coordination polymer (CP) glasses offer a way to tackle the fabrication challenges encountered by inorganic porous membranes and show great potentials for size&#8208;exclusive gas separation. However, their processability and performance still cannot simultaneously meet the requirements for high&#8208;performance membrane separation. Herein, we have developed a series of CP glasses (M&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm, M=Zn, Cd, Cu, and Mn), which possess low vitrification temperature as well as low viscosity (&#951;) and lave capability above the transition temperatures. The derived glass (agM&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm) membranes show outstanding performances for H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation, which all far surpass the Robeson upper bound and even rival against the best of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas separation membranes. The low viscosities not only allow us to hot&#8208;cast or hot&#8208;press the CP glasses into thin membranes within 5&#8197;min without sacrificing their selectivity and permeability, but also endow the resulted glass membranes with healing ability.

         <title>A Color&#8208;Shifting Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Aptamer&#8211;Fluorophore Module for Live&#8208;Cell RNA Imaging</title>

A color&#8208;shifting, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent aptamer&#8211;fluorophore module based on benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin (BC) fluorophores for ratiometric RNA imaging is reported. Free BC is cyan fluorescent, however its fluorescence emission shifts to NIR upon complexation with the BC&#8208;binding aptamer (BeCA). This system enabled the visualization of mRNAs in the NIR region and the ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) have become promising tools for visualizing RNAs in living cells. Specific binding of FLAPs to their non&#8208;fluorescent cognate ligands results in a dramatic fluorescence increase, thereby allowing RNA imaging. Here, we present a color&#8208;shifting aptamer&#8208;fluorophore system, where the free dye is cyan fluorescent and the aptamer&#8208;dye complex is near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent. Unlike other reported FLAPs, this system enables ratiometric RNA imaging. To design the color&#8208;shifting system, we synthesized a series of environmentally sensitive benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin hybrid fluorophores which exist in equilibrium between a cyan fluorescent spirocyclic form and a NIR fluorescent zwitterionic form. As an RNA tag, we evolved a 38&#8208;nucleotide aptamer that selectively binds the zwitterionic forms with nanomolar affinity. We used this system as a light&#8208;up RNA marker to image mRNAs in the NIR region and demonstrated its utility in ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.

         <title>Mo2C/C Hierarchical Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow Spheres as Sulfur Host for Advanced Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21512-21520, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo2C/C hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres with mesoporous thick inner shell and microporous thin outer shell are proposed as an ideal sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The double&#8208;shelled spheres demonstrate superior structural and compositional advantages when employed as cathode material in Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
One of the major challenges regarding the sulfur cathode of Li&#8208;S batteries is to achieve high sulfur loading, fast Li ions transfer, and the suppression of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling. This issue can be solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N&#8208;doped carbon hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres (Mo2C/C HDS&#8208;HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS&#8208;HSs achieve high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double&#8208;shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation. Furthermore, Mo2C/C composition renders the HDS&#8208;HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo2C/C/S HDS&#8208;HSs electrode with high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability in the composed Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Interfacial Defect of Lithium Metal in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling studied the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolytes with a wide range of lattice mismatch, and discovered an interfacial disordered Li defect layer at the interfaces and their roles in leading to the interfacial failure during lithium cycling.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery with Li metal anode is a promising rechargeable battery technology with high energy density and improved safety. Currently, the application of Li metal anode is plagued by the failure at the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolyte (SE). However, little is known about the defects at Li&#8211;SE interfaces and their effects on Li cycling, impeding further improvement of Li metal anodes. Herein, by performing large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling of Li metal interfaces with common SEs, we discover that lithium metal forms an interfacial defect layer of nanometer&#8208;thin disordered lithium at the Li&#8211;SE interfaces. This interfacial defect Li layer is highly detrimental, leading to interfacial failure such as pore formation and contact loss during Li stripping. By systematically studying and comparing incoherent, coherent, and semi&#8208;coherent Li&#8211;SE interfaces, we find that the interface with good lattice coherence has reduced Li defects at the interface and has suppressed interfacial failure during Li cycling. Our finding discovered the critical roles of atomistic lithium defects at interfaces for the interfacial failure of Li metal anode, and motivates future atomistic&#8208;level interfacial engineering for Li metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>A General Synthesis Strategy for Hollow Metal Oxide Microspheres Enabled by Gel&#8208;Assisted Precipitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21377-21383, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;assisted precipitation (GAP) avoids synthesis challenges caused by the divergent properties of targeted metal and provides a simple and scalable method to build a large variety of hollow objects as demonstrated by more than 20 different kinds of HMMs as well as hollow structures of metal phosphate. The hollow and mesoporous Nb2O5 microspheres have favorable charge transport kinetics in a Li&#8208;ion intercalation pseudocapacitor.







Abstract
Hollow metal oxide microspheres (HMMs) have drawn enormous attention in different research fields. Reliable and scalable synthetic protocols applicable for a large variety of metal oxides are in emergent demand. Here we demonstrated that polymer hydrogel, such as the resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) one, existed as an efficient synthetic platform to build HMMs. Specifically, the RF gel forms stacked RF microspheres enlaced with its aqueous phase, where the following evaporation of the highly dispersed water leads to a gel&#8208;assisted precipitation (GAP) of the dissolved metal precursor onto the embedded polymeric solids suited for the creation of HMMs. By taking advantage of the structural features of hydrogel, this synthesis design avoids the delicate control on the usually necessitated coating process and provides a simple and effective synthetic process versatile for functional HMMs, particularly Nb2O5 as a high&#8208;performance electrode material in Li&#8208;ion intercalation pseudocapacitor.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol and Phenyl Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21529-21535, September 20, 2021. </description>

Sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry is used to generate polyphenols from small molecules and biological macromolecules containing phenolic groups, enabling the subsequent coordination of the polyphenols with metal ions to engineer coatings on a variety of substrates.







Abstract
We report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412&#8197;kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional .OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives and different metal ions including FeII, FeIII, CuII, and CoII. In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. The properties of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for surface engineering.

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Diverse Conventional Photoredox Catalysts Induces Potent Photoreductant Activity**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21418-21425, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical activation of conventional photocatalysts induces potent photoreductant activity. These studies resulted in the discovery of an electron&#8208;primed photoredox catalyst capable of cleaving strong aryl C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bonds to aryl radical intermediates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that enhanced activity relative to previously developed electron&#8208;primed photoredox systems was a result of improved catalyst stability.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that electrochemical stimulation induces new photocatalytic activity from a range of structurally diverse conventional photocatalysts. These studies uncover a new electron&#8208;primed photoredox catalyst capable of promoting the reductive cleavage of strong C(sp2)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;O bonds. We illustrate several examples of the synthetic utility of these deeply reducing but otherwise safe and mild catalytic conditions. Finally, we employ electrochemical current measurements to perform a reaction progress kinetic analysis. This technique reveals that the improved activity of this new system is a consequence of an enhanced catalyst stability profile.

Self&#8208;healing gas separation membranes based on coordination polymers (CPs) are reported by Xiao Feng, Bo Wang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21304. The low viscosity in the molten state and the low vitrification temperature equip the CPs with good processability and self&#8208;healing properties. Thin glass membranes can be prepared by hot&#8208;pressing or hot&#8208;casting methods, and they exhibit excellent molecular size&#8208;exclusive effects for gas separation.

A one&#8208;dimensional arrangement of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), namely partially oxidized dysprosium(III) phthalocyaninato double&#8208;decker complexes, [DyPc2]Ix, was synthesized in the Communication by Keiichi Katoh, Masahiro Yamashita et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;21179 by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. The results of spectrophotometric analysis on [DyPc2]Ix are consistent with the Drude model, which theoretically explains the optical response of the metal. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the spin blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects observed as magnetic hysteresis were observed for the SMM. This strategy may pave the way for the construction of electro&#8208;conductive SMMs as spin valves.

A ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was followed for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate&#8208;protected gold 25&#8208;atom metal nanoclusters (NCs) using five experimental techniques by Yuichi Negishi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21340. Based on the obtained knowledge, a method to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation was established, and thereby a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability was created.

The crystallization of tin&#8208;based perovskites is improved thanks to the fluoride in SnF2. The anion of this typical additive is responsible for a more homogeneous nucleation in solution&#8208;processed perovskite thin film formation. In addition, fluoride selectively complexes SnIV and prevents its incorporation into the perovskite structure, as reported by Jorge Pascual, Antonio Abate, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21583.

         <title>Coupling Strategy for CO2 Valorization Integrated with Organic Synthesis by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</title>

The photoredox&#8208;catalyzed win&#8211;win coupling strategy, in which CO2 valorization is integrated with organic synthesis in one reaction system, provides a promising approach that enables sufficient utilization of excited electrons and holes to achieve feasible and sustainable light&#8208;mediated artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to solar fuels and/or fine chemicals is a promising way to increase the energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the conventional reaction system for CO2 photoreduction with pure H2O or sacrificial agents usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency, poor stability, or cost&#8208;ineffective atom economy. A recent surge of developments, in which photocatalytic CO2 valorization is integrated with selective organic synthesis into one reaction system, indicates an efficient modus operandi that enables sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to achieve the goals for sustainable economic and social development. In this Review we discuss current advances in cooperative photoredox reaction systems that integrate CO2 valorization with organics upgrading based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The applications and virtues of this strategy and the underlying reaction mechanisms are discussed. The ongoing challenges and prospects in this area are critically discussed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Homolysis of Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal&#8208;Substrate Complexes: A Complementary Activation Strategy in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21100-21115, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes in photoredox catalysis offers a complementary mode of activation for organic substrates through visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis (VLIH) of metal&#8211;substrate bonds. This Minireview describes different electronic transitions that occur in photoexcited metal&#8211;substrate complexes as well as recent advancements and future prospects in this area.







Abstract
The mainstream applications of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis predominately involve outer&#8208;sphere single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) processes of precious metal RuII or IrIII complexes or of organic dyes with low photostability. Earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based MnLn&#8208;type (M=metal, Ln=polydentate ligands) complexes are rapidly evolving as alternative photocatalysts as they offer not only economic and ecological advantages but also access to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere mechanistic modes, thereby transcending their inherent limitations of ultrashort excited&#8208;state lifetimes for use as effective photocatalysts. The generic process, termed visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis (VLIH), entails the formation of suitable light&#8208;absorbing ligated metal&#8211;substrate complexes (MnLn&#8208;Z; Z=substrate) that can undergo homolytic cleavage to generate Mn&#8722;1Ln and Z. for further transformations.

This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.







Abstract
Photomediated Giese reactions are at the forefront of radical chemistry, much like the classical tin&#8208;mediated Giese reactions were nearly forty years ago. With the global recognition of organometallic photocatalysts for the mild and tunable generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals, chemists have developed a torrent of strategies to form previously inaccessible radical intermediates that are capable of engaging in intermolecular conjugate addition reactions. This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.

         <title>Regulating Local Electron Density of Iron Single Sites by Introducing Nitrogen Vacancies for Efficient Photo&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as electron trap sites, thus directing photoelectrons to accumulate at Fe single sites under light illumination. The formation of a highly concentrated electron density at the Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2 conversion efficiency.







Abstract
The activity of heterogeneous photocatalytic H2O2 activation in Fenton&#8208;like processes is closely related to the local electron density of reaction centre atoms. However, the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs arising from random charge transfer greatly restricts the oriented electron delivery to active center. Here we show a defect engineered iron single atom photocatalyst (Fe1&#8208;Nv/CN, single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon nitride with abundant nitrogen vacancies) for the activation of H2O2 under visible light irradiation. Based on DFT calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy results, the engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as the electron trap sites, which can directionally drive the electrons to concentrate on Fe atoms. The formation of highly concentrated electrons density at Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2 conversion efficiency. Therefore, the optimized single atom catalyst exhibiting a higher ciprofloxacin degradation activity, which was up to 18 times that of pristine CN.

         <title>C&#8722;Boron Enolates Enable Palladium Catalyzed Carboboration of Internal 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>

A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, in cooperation with a Pd complex supported by an 1,4&#8208;azaborine&#8208;derived phosphine ligand, transforms enynes into highly substituted dienyl boronates in exquisite site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, generated by a kinetically controlled halogen exchange between chlorocatecholborane and silylketene acetals, is described. These C&#8722;boron enolates are demonstrated to activate 1,3&#8208;enyne substrates in the presence of a Pd0/Senphos ligand complex, resulting in the first examples of a carboboration reaction of an alkyne with enolate&#8208;equivalent nucleophiles. Highly substituted dienyl boron building blocks are produced in excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity by the described catalytic cis&#8208;carboboration reaction.

         <title>Mild Intermolecular Synthesis of a Cyclopropane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic Skeleton: Unusual Reactivity of Isobenzopyryliums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21272-21276, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new intermolecular approach for the expedient access to cyclopropane&#8208;incorporated tricyclic skeleton from the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinyl boronic acids has been achieved. This protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions as compared to traditional approaches.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes embedded in a polycyclic bridged architecture are a versatile structural motif, but such complex frameworks often impose substantial synthetic challenges. Herein we introduce a new approach for the expedient access to such spring&#8208;loaded strained systems via an exceptionally mild intermolecular convergent process between the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinyl boronic acids. Different from the typical conventional approaches, our protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions in order to overcome the disfavored kinetic and thermodynamic problems. Instead, the key cyclopropane ring was formed between the well&#8208;positioned nucleophile and electrophile in the adduct from the regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition. Thus, this unusual process also represents a new reactivity of the versatile isobenzopyryliums. The choice of a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst with proper acidity is crucial to the high efficiency and selectivity for this multiple bond&#8208;forming process. The strained products are precursors to other useful synthetic building blocks.

         <title>Fluorosulfuryl Isocyanate Enabled SuFEx Ligation of Alcohols and Amines</title>

Fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSI, FSO2&#8208;NCO) is established as a reliable bis&#8208;electrophilic linker for stepwise attachment of alcohol and amine bearing modules. In step&#8208;1, FSI's isocyanate fuses directly and quickly with alcohols and phenols, and aliphatic amines are attached through the sulfuryl carbamate transfer strategy, both with remarkable selectivity. In step&#8208;2, best yields of S&#8722;N linked products arise with a unique on water process. The scope of SuFEx ligation is greatly expanded in directions which would be especially interesting for drug discovery and chemical biology.







Abstract
Fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSI, FSO2NCO) is established as a reliable bis&#8208;electrophilic linker for stepwise attachment of an alcohol bearing module to an amine bearing module and thence a new module RO&#8208;C(=O)&#8208;NH&#8208;SO2&#8208;NR&#8242;R&#8242;&#8242; is created. FSI's isocyanate motif fuses directly and quickly with alcohols and phenols, affording fluorosulfuryl carbamates in nearly quantitative yield. A new reagent and process to deliver the FSI&#8208;derived fluorosulfuryl carbamate fragment to amines are also developed. The resulting SVI&#8722;F motifs from step&#8208;1 are remarkably stable, given the great structural complexities in diverse products. In the step&#8208;2 reaction with amines, the best yield of the S&#8722;N linked products arise with water alone. This &#8220;on water&#8221; interfacial reactivity phenomenon is crucial, revealing the latent reactivity of SVI&#8722;F probe for potential covalent capture of proteins in vivo which is important in today's drug discovery. The scope of the SuFEx chemistry is largely expanded thereby and the facile entry to these phosphate&#8208;like connections should prove useful to click chemistry across diverse fields.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation of Racemic Diastereomers: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Michael&#8211;Henry Reactions to Afford Spirooxindoles Bearing Furan&#8208;Fused Rings</title>

Organocatalytic Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions that occur through dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations of racemic diastereomers having central and axial chiralities have been developed for the synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused ring systems. The products, with four new chiral carbon centers, were obtained as single diastereomers in high yields with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) reactions of racemic diastereomer mixtures that afford the products as essentially single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities are described. We demonstrated the DYKAT in the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused rings. The starting materials of the DYKAT, dihydrobenzofuranone derivatives, were synthesized in racemic diastereomer mixtures, and these were transformed to the spirooxindole derivatives in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities through Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions with nitrostyrenes under organocatalytic conditions. In the reactions, regardless the stereochemistry of the starting materials, all the four isomers were transformed to single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities, and four new chiral centers were created.

         <title>Recognition of the True and False Resonance Raman Optical Activity</title>

A strong influence of electronic circular dichroism on the measurement of resonance Raman optical activity of colorful chiral compounds is reported for a series of vitamin B12 derivatives. Neglecting this effect can lead to misinterpretation of recorded spectra, and seriously erroneous conclusions about molecular structure and chirality.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) possesses all aspects of a sensitive tool for molecular detection, but its measurement remains challenging. We demonstrate that reliable recording of RROA of chiral colorful compounds is possible, but only after considering the effect of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) on the ROA spectra induced by the dissolved chiral compound. We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B12 derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory. Neglecting the ECD effect during ROA measurement can lead to misinterpretation of the recorded spectra and erroneous conclusions about the molecular structure.

         <title>Direct NO Reduction by a Biomimetic Iron(II) Pyrazolate MOF</title>

A novel iron(II) metal&#8211;organic framework containing accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers facilitates the direct reduction of NO to N2O.







Abstract
A novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) containing one&#8208;dimensional, Fe2+ chains bridged by dipyrazolate linkers and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands has been synthesized. The unusual chain&#8208;type metal nodes feature accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers, resulting in motifs that are reminiscent of the active sites in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The MOF facilitates direct reduction of nitric oxide (NO), producing nearly quantitative yields of nitrous oxide (N2O) and emulating the reactivity of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs). The ferrous form of the MOF can be regenerated via a synthetic cycle involving reduction with cobaltocene (CoCp2) followed by reaction with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf).

         <title>Deuterated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Significantly Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21250-21255, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to improve luminescence performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated by introducing an isotope effect, which is achieved through substitution of hydrogen in high&#8208;frequency oscillators X&#8208;H (X=O, N, C) by the heavier isotope deuterium. The first deuterated COF exhibits a 19&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield over the non&#8208;deuterated counterpart.







Abstract
Luminescent covalent organic frameworks (COFs) find promising applications in chemical sensing, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices, however, the majority of COFs are non or weakly emissive owing to the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) or the molecular thermal motion&#8208;based energy dissipation. Here, we report a previously unperceived approach to improve luminescence performance of COFs by introducing isotope effect, which is achieved through substitution of hydrogen from high&#8208;frequency oscillators X&#8208;H (X=O, N, C) by heavier isotope deuterium. Combining the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; and in situ deuteration methods generates the first deuterated COF, which exhibits an impressively 19&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield over that of the non&#8208;deuterated counterpart. These results are interpreted by theoretical calculations as the consequence of slower C/N&#8208;D and OD&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O vibrations that impede the nonradiative deactivation process. The proposed strategy is proved applicable to many other types of emissive COFs.

         <title>Microporous Carbon Nitride (C3N5.4) with Tetrazine based Molecular Structure for Efficient Adsorption of CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21242-21249, September 20, 2021. </description>

The new class of microporous carbon nitride with rich nitrogen moieties templated from zeolite shows periodic porosity with a unique CN framework and enhanced active sites that triggered highly selective sensing owing to the high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen species.







Abstract
Mesoporous carbon nitrides with C3N5 and C3N6 stoichiometries created a new momentum in the field of organic metal&#8208;free semiconductors owing to their unique band structures and high basicity. Here, we report on the preparation of a novel graphitic microporous carbon nitride with a tetrazine based chemical structure and the composition of C3N5.4 using ultra&#8208;stable Y zeolite as the template and aminoguanidine hydrochloride, a high nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule, as the CN precursor. Spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the prepared material exhibits a new molecular structure, which comprises two tetrazines and one triazine rings in the unit cell and is thermodynamically stable. The resultant carbon nitride shows an outstanding surface area of 130.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates excellent CO2 adsorption per unit surface area of 47.54&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is due to the existence of abundant free NH2 groups, basic sites and microporosity. The material also exhibits highly selective sensing over water molecules (151.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and aliphatic hydrocarbons due to its unique microporous structure with a high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen moieties and recognizing ability towards small molecules.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Gene Editing to Reduce Tumor Thermal Tolerance for Mild&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21200-21204, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;responsive nanocomposite composed of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 attached to gold nanorods delivers Cas9&#8208;sgHSP90&#945; to tumors. Gene editing reduces the thermal tolerance of the tumor cells and then mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is possible with near&#8208;IR light.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is usually associated with undesirable damage to healthy organs nearby due to the high temperatures (&gt;50&#8201;&#176;C) available for tumor ablation. Low&#8208;temperature PTT would therefore have tremendous value for clinical application. Here, we construct a hypoxia&#8208;responsive gold nanorods (AuNRs)&#8208;based nanocomposite of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 for mild&#8208;photothermal therapy via tumor&#8208;targeted gene editing. AuNRs are modified with azobenzene&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (p&#8208;AZO) to achieve on&#8208;demand release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 using hypoxia&#8208;responsive azo bonds. In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the azo groups of the hypoxia&#8208;activated CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 nanosystem based on gold nanorods (APACPs) are selectively reduced by the overexpression of reductases, leading to the release of Cas9 and subsequent gene editing. Owing to the knockout of HSP90&#945; for reducing the thermal resistance of cancer cells, highly effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo was achieved with APACPs under mild PTT.

The first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;mannolide&#8197;C, a highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid is reported. The synthetic strategy features efficient double ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions for the formation of the highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic system.







Abstract
(+)&#8208;Mannolide&#8197;C is a complex hexacyclic C20 cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid featuring a highly strained 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic core containing eight consecutive stereocenters and two bridging lactones.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Hydrogen Bonding of B3N6&#8208;[4]Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21289-21294, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is isoelectronic to the trianion of [4]triangulene, represents a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride. The tert&#8208;butylated derivative of B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene is synthesized by threefold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation. Its fluorescence in solution is responsive to binding p&#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through H&#8208;bonds, and it forms DD&#8208;AA H&#8208;bond arrays with di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrenetetraone in the co&#8208;crystal.







Abstract
Replacement of the allylic C=C&#8722;C unit with a N&#8722;B&#8722;N unit at each of the three zigzag edges of [4]triangulene gives rise to B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is envisioned to represent a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride (BC4N). A tert&#8208;butylated B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three&#8208;fold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;&#8208;electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8722;B&#8722;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, which forms H&#8208;bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD&#8208;AA hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays with 2,7&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone in the co&#8208;crystal.

&lt;p&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-[4]triangulene, which is isoelectronic to the trianion of [4]triangulene, represents a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride. The &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylated derivative of B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-[4]triangulene is synthesized by threefold nitrogen-directed borylation. Its fluorescence in solution is responsive to binding &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzoate anion through H-bonds, and it forms DD-AA H-bond arrays with di(&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl)-pyrenetetraone in the co-crystal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacement of the allylic C=C&#8722;C unit with a N&#8722;B&#8722;N unit at each of the three zigzag edges of [4]triangulene gives rise to B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-[4]triangulene, which is envisioned to represent a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride (BC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N). A &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylated B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three-fold nitrogen-directed borylation, and the X-ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;-electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8722;B&#8722;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen-bond donor, which forms H-bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD-AA hydrogen-bond arrays with 2,7-di(&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl)-pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone in the co-crystal. Moreover, the blue fluorescence of B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-[4]triangulene in solution is responsive to binding &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzoate anion through hydrogen bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>P&#8208;Block Atomically Dispersed Antimony Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21237-21241, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;block atomically dispersed antimony with Sb&#8722;N4 configuration has been developed and used as highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The excellent ORR activity is credited to the p orbital interaction between Sb cation and O2, which facilitates the charge transfer and generates appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group (s&#8208; and p&#8208;block) metals are generally regarded as catalytically inactive due to the delocalized s/p&#8208;band. Herein, we successfully synthesized a p&#8208;block antimony single&#8208;atom catalyst (Sb SAC) with the Sb&#8722;N4 configuration for efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The obtained Sb SAC exhibits superior ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V and excellent stability, which outperforms most transition&#8208;metal (TM, d&#8208;block) based SACs and commercial Pt/C. In addition, it presents an excellent power density of 184.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high specific capacity (803.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) in Zn&#8211;air battery. Both experiment and theoretical calculation manifest that the active catalytic sites are positively charged Sb&#8722;N4 single&#8208;metal sites, which have closed d shells. Density of states (DOS) results unveil the p orbital of the atomically dispersed Sb cation in Sb SAC can easily interact with O2&#8208;p orbital to form hybrid states, facilitating the charge transfer and generating appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step. This work sheds light on the atomic&#8208;level preparing p&#8208;block Sb metal catalyst for highly active ORR, and further provides valuable guidelines for the rational design of other main&#8208;group&#8208;metal SACs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;oxiranes: An Asymmetric Addition/Aldol/Spirocyclization Domino Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21189-21194, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/aldol/spirocyclization domino cascade to generate spiro&#8208;oxiranes is reported. sp2&#8208; and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon nucleophiles are used to initiate the cascade to give arylated and alkynylated products.







Abstract
Enantioenriched spiro&#8208;oxiranes bearing three contiguous stereocenters were synthesized using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/aldol/spirocyclization sequence. Starting from a linear substrate, the cascade enabled the formation of a spirocyclic framework in a single step. sp2&#8208; and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon nucleophiles were found to be competent initiators for this cascade, giving arylated or alkynylated products, respectively. Derivatization studies demonstrated the synthetic versatility of both the epoxide and the alkyne moieties of the products. DFT calculations were used to reconcile spectroscopic discrepancies observed between the solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the products.

Cyanine groups introduced into DNA could increase the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and multiple drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanospheres. Therefore, cyanine&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly system provides an adaptable approach to prepare a two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrug.







Abstract
The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy provides a We developed a simple and versatile approach to prepare a series of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrugs through direct self&#8208;assembly of cyanine&#8208;labeled single&#8208;stranded DNA (Cys&#8208;DNA) and different types of drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the Cys introduced into the DNA could enhance the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form hybrid Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanosphere. Such nanospheres serve as both carriers and cargoes, excluding the extra use of nontherapeutic excipients and showing ultrahigh drug loading capacity. Following this approach, an antisense oligonucleotides/doxorubicin nanodrug model was constructed, demonstrating the significant synergistic anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. As a proof of the concept, our study establishes a simple and reproducible two&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid&#8208;based drug formulation.

The final puzzle piece fits in! Beryllium is the last of the non&#8208;radioactive s&#8208;block metals to be coordinated to indenyl ligands. Milling K[C9H7] with BeBr2 produces the indenyl complex [Be(C9H7)2]. Its crystal structure reveals mixed &#951;5/&#951;1 ring coordination. The monomeric &#8220;half&#8208;sandwich&#8221; complex [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] is available via the same method.







Abstract
The bonding in beryllocene, [BeCp2], took decades to establish, owing to its unexpected mixed hapticity structure (i.e., [Be(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#951;1&#8208;Cp)]). Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;5 &#8644; &#951;3 shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#8242;] + BeX2 in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent&#8208;free grinding of BeBr2 and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C9H7)2] (1) and [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] (2). The former displays &#951;5/&#951;1&#8208;coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that an &#951;5/&#951;5&#8208;conformation is less than 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy.

Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &#8644; &#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#8242;] + BeX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent-free grinding of BeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Be{1,3-(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}Br] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). The former displays &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that an &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-conformation is less than 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; higher in energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[Ag(NH3)2]2SO4: A Strategy for the Coordination of Cationic Moieties to Design Nonlinear Optical Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21216-21220, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties offers a new possibility for the rational design and property modification of functional ionic materials, particularly NLO materials. As demonstrated by [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 and Ag2SO4, the exceptional enhancements of the linear birefringence and nonlinear SHG properties are attributed to the unique [Ag(NH3)2]+ cation moiety.







Abstract
Over recent decades, guided by the anionic group theory of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, rational design strategies have been primarily focused on anionic moieties; consequently, structural modification and design of cationic moieties have long been neglected. Herein, we report a strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties that substantially enhances the optical properties of NLO materials. For an example with well&#8208;known crystal structure, [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4, we demonstrate that the coordination of the Ag+ cation by the neutral ligand drives the formation of a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal P
21c structure as a positive uniaxial crystal. The bending of the [Ag(NH3)2]+ cationic moiety parallel to the z&#8208;axis generates an anisotropic arrangement of the dipoles, i.e., a dipole of 0.12&#8197;D along the z&#8208;direction, yet zero dipole in the xy&#8208;plane, which interacts anisotropically with the incident light oscillating electromagnetic wave, leading to optical anisotropy with a large birefringence. The incident beam of 589.3&#8197;nm normal to the (110) crystal plane measures &#916;nobv.=0.08, and [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 also exhibits a phase&#8208;matching NLO response 1.4 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) (obv. 1.4&#215;KDP @1064&#8197;nm; cal. d36=1.50&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1).

NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity through formation of HSNO and HSSNO. Zinc complexes of their conjugate bases Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) result in stabilization of these anions at a biologically relevant metal site yet reveal disparate signaling output upon reaction with thiols.







Abstract
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity. HSNO and HSSNO with their conjugate bases &#8722;SNO and &#8722;SSNO form in the reaction of H2S with NO as well as S&#8208;nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitrite (NO2&#8722;) that serve as NO reservoirs. While HSNO and HSSNO are elusive, their conjugate bases form isolable zinc complexes Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) supported by tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands. Reaction of Na(15&#8208;C&#8208;5)SSNO with Ph,MeTpZn(ClO4) provides Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) that undergoes S&#8208;atom removal by PEt3 to give Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and S=PEt3. Unexpectedly stable at room temperature, these Zn&#8208;SNO and Zn&#8208;SSNO complexes release NO upon heating. Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) quickly react with acidic thiols such as C6F5SH to form N2O and NO, respectively. Increasing the thiol basicity in p&#8208;substituted aromatic thiols 4&#8722;XArSH in the reaction with Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) turns on competing S&#8208;nitrosation to form Ph,MeTpZn&#8208;SH and RSNO, the latter a known precursor for NO.

         <title>Discovery and Characterization of Spike N&#8208;Terminal Domain&#8208;Binding Aptamers for Rapid SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Detection</title>

Rapid diagnostics are essential for early detection of COVID&#8208;19 and reduced disease spread. In this study, we discovered the DNA aptamer SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain binding aptamer 1), which binds with high affinity and specificity to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein as well as UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.







Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (&lt;80&#8197;nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo&#8208;EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N&#8208;terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 at concentrations as low as 5&#215;105&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1. SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 diagnostics.

         <title>Rapid and Direct Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation and Arylation in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21277-21282, September 20, 2021. </description>

Need for speed: An efficient and fast photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow has been realized by combining decatungstate photocatalysis and nickel catalysis. The methodology shows great functional group tolerance and high regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various biologically&#8208;relevant molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow. The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8211;48&#8197;hours to only 5&#8211;15&#8197;minutes.

     alt="Rapid and Direct Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation and Arylation in Flow"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need for speed: An efficient and fast photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow has been realized by combining decatungstate photocatalysis and nickel catalysis. The methodology shows great functional group tolerance and high regioselectivity, and can be used for the late-stage functionalization of various biologically-relevant molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow. The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon-centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8211;48&#8197;hours to only 5&#8211;15&#8197;minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Four&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21283-21288, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wittig reaction within a dearomatized pyridine ring system results in 4&#8208;alkylated pyridines, a valuable motif in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sciences. N&#8208;Triazinyl salts are key to this strategy, and a range of substituted pyridines and aldehydes are amenable. Late&#8208;stage methylation is also feasible using a formaldehyde surrogate.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine N&#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and N&#8208;triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2&#8208;sp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.

Conductive Dy3+ phthalocyaninato complex single&#8208;molecule magnets, which exhibit slow magnetic relaxation, can be arranged in a 1D array by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. Hysteresis of the magnetoresistance of the 1D array derived from the &#960;&#8208;f interactions was observed at 2.2&#8197;K.







Abstract
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) arrangement of an unsubstituted partially oxidized Dy3+ double&#8208;decker complex, [DyPc2]Ix (Pc=phthalocyaninato, I=iodide; 1.93&lt;x&lt;2.26) (1), was obtained by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. In 1, the Pc ligands were partially oxidized, and I3&#8722; ion was present as a counter ion. From the results of spectrophotometric analysis on 1, the &#960; radicals were delocalized in a 1D column and behaved as a conductor even at low&#8208;temperatures. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects corresponding to a magnetic hysteresis of single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) were observed when the galvanomagnetic characteristics were investigated at 2.2&#8197;K.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures of sodium hypochlorite and hypobromite hydrates provide the first direct insight into the geometry and hydrogen bonding properties of hypohalites, anions of great importance in general and inorganic chemistry. The crystal structure of sodium hypochlorite, the active component of bleach, fills a long&#8208;standing gap in structural chemistry, dating back to the discovery of chlorine bleaching by Berthollet, and the first development of liquid bleach in Javel, 18th&#160;century France. Details of this research are reported by Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263; et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108843).

Trapezohedral NiO particles observed in experiments are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to locally&#8208;ordered alkali chloride structures which act as capping agents during crystal growth. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO particles are produced because of their stable hydroxylated surfaces.

         <title>Li4MgGe2S7: The First Alkali and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Diamond&#8208;Like Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material with Exceptional Large Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal tetrahedra units with an excellent diamond&#8208;like structure (DLS) template, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal DLS infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) material Li4MgGe2S7 was rationally designed and fabricated. This work enriches the diversity of DLS compounds, and opens an avenue for the design and exploration of new infrared NLO materials with excellent NLO properties, as outlined by Shilie Pan, Junjie Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107613).

         <title>Radical Bridged Ln4 Metallocene Complexes with Strong Magnetic Coupling and Large Coercive Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing magnetic coupling in 4f&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets is an ongoing challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202110813), Akseli Mansikkam&#228;ki, Muralee Murugesu and co&#8208;workers have incorporated highly delocalized tetrazinyl radicals to bridge 4f metallocenes, forming tetranuclear complexes. A thorough examination of the magnetic properties and computational studies support a radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model with strong exchange interactions, zero&#8208;field SMM behaviour and a giant coercive field of 3&#8197;T.

         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactions are lattice&#8208;controlled reactions that occur in crystals or other confined media. However, only a handful of topochemical reactions are known so far. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109344), K.&#8197;M. Sureshan and R. Khazeber report a new topochemical reaction: topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction, in which a proximally placed azide and an alkene undergo a cycloaddition reaction to form triazoline in a regiospecific, stereospecific, and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion.

         <title>Desolvation of peptide bond by O to S substitution impacts protein stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid side chains are key to fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment polarity in proteins composed of polar amide bonds. Here, we report that substituting an oxygen atom of the backbone amide bond with sulfur atom desolvates the thioamide bond, thereby increasing its lipophilicity. The impact of such local desolvation by O to S substitution in proteins was tested by synthesizing thioamidated variants of Pin1 WW domain. We observe that a thioamide acts in synergy with nonpolar amino acid side chains to reduce the microenvironment polarity and increase protein stability by more than 14 &#176;C. Through favorable van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions, this single atom substitution significantly stabilizes proteins without altering the amino acid sequence and structure of the native protein.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Dissociation of Carbon&#8208;Oxygen bonds in CO2 and CO on the Surface of LaCoSiHx Intermetallic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In catalysis science, the electronic structure of the active site determines the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the catalyst to a large extent. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal&#8208;based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiH  x  material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co&#8208;based catalysts. Using CO  2  methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO  2  and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiH  x  catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiH  x  has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8208;oxygen bond activation than does the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transferring from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO  2  and CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards dendrite free potassium metal batteries: A rational design of multifunctional 3D polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;borax layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>K metal is optimal anode for K ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issue due to unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium metal batteries, a 3D PVA&#8208;Borax layer is rational designed which enables a dendrite free K plating/stripping process. Such protective layer possesses good wettability, high K ionic diffusivity and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA&#8208;Borax (PVA&#8208;Borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700 h at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 500 h at 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 10% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25% DOD and 50% DOD, the PVA&#8208;Borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180 h and 100 h, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical NO Reduction into NH3 by MoS2 Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of NO not only offers an attractive alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ambient NH  3  production but mitigates the human&#8208;caused unbalance of nitrogen cycle. Herein, we report that MoS  2  nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS  2  /GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH  3  conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS  2  /GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 75.9% and a large NH  3  yield of up to 91 &#181;mol cm  &#8722;2  h  &#8722;1  . Using MoS  2  nanosheet&#8208;loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device of Zn&#8211;NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04 mW cm  &#8722;2  and an NH  3  yield of 452 &#181;g h  &#8722;1  mg  cat.  &#8722;1  . Theoretical calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo&#8208;edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an &#8220;acceptance&#8208;donation&#8221; mechanism and unfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilizing Redox&#8208;Active Tricycloquinazoline into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaromatic&#8208;conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li&#8208;ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes. Herein, we immobilize a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and CuO  4  unit into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) to unlock their potential for Li  +  storage. TQ was identified redox activity with Li  +  for the first time. With a synergistic effect of TQ and CuO  4  unit, the 2D conductive MOF, named Cu&#8208;HHTQ (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), can facilitate the Li  +  /e  &#8208;  transport and ensure a resilient electrode, resulting in a high capacity of 657.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 600 mA g  &#8208;1  with extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. Our findings highlight an efficient strategy of constructing electrode materials for energy storage with combining multiple redox&#8208;active moieties into conductive MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Overlooked Natural Hydrogen Evolution Pathway: Ni2+ Boosting H2O Reduction by Fe(OH)2 Oxidation during Low&#8208;temperature Serpentinization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural hydrogen (H 2  ) has gained considerable attentions as a renewable energy resource to mitigate the globally increasing environmental concerns. Low&#8208;temperature serpentinization (&lt; 200 &#176;  C) as a typical water&#8208;rock reaction is a major source of the natural H 2  . However, the reaction mechanism and the controlling step to product H 2  remained unclear, which hinders the further utilization of natural H 2  . Herein, we demonstrated that the H 2  production rate could be determined by the Fe(OH) 2  oxidation during low&#8208;temperature serpentinization. Moreover, the co&#8208;existence of Ni 2+  could largely enhance the H 2  production kinetics. With the addition of only 1 % Ni 2+  , the H 2  production rate was remarkably enhanced by about two orders of magnitude at 90 &#176;  C. D 2  O isotopic experiment and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced H 2  production kinetics could be attributed to the catalytic role of Ni 2+  to promote the reduction of H 2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable super&#8208;resolution imaging of lipid droplet dynamics through a buffer strategy with a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although super&#8208;resolution imaging offers an opportunity to visualize cellular structures and organelles at the nanoscale level, cellular heterogeneity and unpredictability still pose a significant challenge in the dynamic imaging of live cells. It is thus vital to develop better performing and more photostable probes for long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging. Herein, we report a probe  LD&#8208;FG  for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics using structured illumination microscopy (SIM).  LD&#8208;FG  allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenicity. The replenishment of photobleached  LD&#8208;FG  by intact ones outside LDs further ensure the long&#8208;time stability of the fluorescence imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized. Two LD coalescence modes (as well as heterogeneity in different regions of the cells and even in between different cells) were discovered for the first time. Notably, the dynamic imaging also allowed us to propose a new model of LD maturation during adipocyte differentiation,  i.e.  , a fast LD coalescence followed by a slow ripening step. The excellent performance of  LD&#8208;FG  makes the buffer strategy an effective method for designing fluorescent probes for cell dynamic imaging.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This study explores synthesis of new carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatics with interesting geometry and useful properties using Scholl reactions. As found from the Scholl reactions of substrates having two carbazole units linked at different positions through  o  &#8208;phenylene, oxidative coupling of carbazole units occured in a regioselective manner with new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds preferably formed at C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 in N&#8208;alkyl carbazole. A new N&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized with single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070 cm  2  /Vs in solution&#8208;processed thin film transistors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prezizane&#8208;type sesquiterpene agarozizanol B was synthesized employing a photochemical cascade reaction as the key step. Starting from a readily available 1&#8208;indanone with a tethered olefin, a strained tetracyclic skeleton was assembled which contained all carbon atoms of the sesquiterpene with the correct relative configuration. The conversion into the tricyclic prezizane skeleton was accomplished by a strategic cyclopropane bond cleavage. Prior to the cyclopropane ring opening an adaption of the oxidation state was required, which could be combined with a reductive resolution step. After removal of two functional groups, the natural product was obtained both in racemic form or &#8211; if resolved &#8211; as the (+)&#8208;enantiomer which was shown to be identical to the natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolic Labeling of Legionaminic acid in Flagellin Glycosylation of Campylobacter jejuni Identifies Maf4 as a Putative Legionaminyl Transferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Campylobacter jejuni  is the major human food&#8208;borne pathogen. Its bipolar flagella are heavily  O  &#8208;glycosylated with microbial sialic acids and essential for its motility and pathogenicity. However, both the glycosylation of flagella and the exact contribution of Legionaminic acid (Leg) to flagellar activity is poorly understood. Here, we report the development of a metabolic labelling method for Leg&#8208;glycosylation on bacterial flagella with probes based on azide&#8208;modified Leg precursors. The hereby azido&#8208;Leg labelled flagellin could be detected by Western blot analysis and imaged on intact bacteria. Using the probes on  C. jejuni  and its isogenic  maf4  mutant we also further substantiate the identification of Maf4 as a putative Leg glycosyltransferase. This is further substantiated with UPLC&#8208;MS detection of labelled CMP&#8208;Leg and an  in silico  model of Maf4. This method and the developed probes will facilitate the study of Leg glycosylation and the functional role of this modification in  C. jejuni  motility and invasiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Encapsulation of Naphthalene Diimide (NDI) Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers: A Tool for Understanding Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers are an important class of chromophores for optoelectronic devices. Understanding and controlling their excited state properties, in particular, radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes are among the greatest challenges that must be overcome. We report the synthesis and characterization of a molecularly encapsulated naphthalene diimide&#8208;based polymer, one of the most successfully used motifs, and explore its structural and optical properties. The molecular encapsulation enables a detailed understanding of the effect interpolymer interactions. We reveal that the non&#8208;encapsulated analogue P(NDI&#8208;2OD&#8208;T) undergoes aggregation enhanced emission; an effect that is suppressed upon encapsulation due to an increasing p&#8208;interchain stacking distance. This suggests that decreasing p&#8208;stacking distances may be an attractive method to enhance the radiative properties of conjugated polymers in contrast to the current paradigm where it is viewed as a source of optical quenching.</dc:description>

         <title>NBN&#8208;Doped Bis&#8208;Tetracene and Peri&#8208;Tetracene: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining solution&#8208;based and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis, we demonstrate here the first synthesis of NBN&#8208;doped  bis  &#8208;tetracene (  NBN&#8208;BT  ) and  peri  &#8208;tetracene (  NBN&#8208;PT  ). Unlike unstable all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based  bis  &#8208;tetracene and  peri  &#8208;tetracene, both  NBN&#8208;BT  and  NBN&#8208;PT  exhibit excellent stability under ambient conditions. The chemical structures of  NBN&#8208;BT  and  NBN&#8208;PT  are clearly elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) characterizations reveal that  NBN&#8208;BT  (3.08 eV) and  NBN&#8208;PT (  3.28 eV) possess higher energy gaps than their carbon&#8208;based  bis  &#8208;tetracene (1.56 eV) and  peri  &#8208;tetracene (1.11 eV) analogs. Interestingly, based on its  in situ  spectroelectrochemical (SEC) characterization,  NBN&#8208;BT  can undergo stepwise one&#8208;electron oxidation and convert into its corresponding radical cation first and then to its dication rather than its diradical dication. The energy gap of the  NBN&#8208;BT  dication (1.24 eV) is similar to that of  bis  &#8208;tetracene (1.56 eV), indicating their isoelectronic relationship. Moreover, a similar energy gap between the  NBN&#8208;PT  dication (1.21 eV) and its isoelectronic structure  peri  &#8208;tetracene (1.11 eV) can be predicted by DFT calculations. This work provides a novel synthesis along with characterizations of multi&#8208;NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged  peri  &#8208;acenes with tunable electronic properties that are not accessible with classical all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based  peri  &#8208;acenes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput discovery of a rhombohedral twelve&#8208;connected zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework with ordered terephthalate and fumarate linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a metal&#8208;organic framework where an ordered array of two linkers with differing length and geometry connect [Zr  6  (OH)  4  O  4  ]  12+  clusters into a twelve&#8208;connected  fcu  net that is rhombohedrally distorted from cubic symmetry. The ordered binding of equal numbers of terephthalate and fumarate ditopic carboxylate linkers at the trigonal antiprismatic Zr  6  core creates close&#8208;packed layers of fumarate&#8208;connected clusters that are connected along the single remaining threefold axis by terephthalates. This well&#8208;defined linker arrangement retains the three&#8208;dimensional porosity of the Zr cluster&#8208;based UiO family while creating two distinct windows within the channels that define two distinct guest diffusion paths. The ordered material is accessed by a restricted combination of composition and process parameters that were identified by high&#8208;throughput synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Anion Chemistry with Mass&#8208;Selected Molecular Fragments on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While reactions between ions and neutral molecules in the gas phase have been studied extensively, reactions between molecular ions of same polarity remain relatively unexplored. Herein we show that reactions between fragment ions generated in the gas phase and molecular ions of the same polarity are possible by soft&#8208;landing of both reagents on surfaces. The reactive [B12I11]1&#8722; anion was deposited on a surface layer built up by landing the generally unreactive [B12I12]2&#8722;. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the generated material shows that [B24I23]3&#8722; was formed. A computational study shows that the product is metastable in the gas phase, but a charge balanced environment of a grounded surface may stabilize the triply charged product, as suggested by model calculations. This opens new opportunities for the generation of highly charged clusters using unconventional building blocks from the gas phase.</dc:description>

Herein we show that reactions between fragment ions generated in the gas phase and molecular ions of the same polarity are possible by soft-landing of both reagents on surfaces. The reactive [B12I11]1&#8722; anion was deposited on a surface layer built up by landing the generally unreactive [B12I12]2&#8722;. Ex-situ analysis of the generated material shows that [B24I23]3&#8722; was formed. A computational study shows that the product is metastable in the gas phase, but a charge balanced environment of a grounded surface may stabilize the triply charged product, as suggested by model calculations. This opens new opportunities for the generation of highly charged clusters using unconventional building blocks from the gas phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;bridged Methylnaphthyl Palladium Dimers as Versatile&#160;Catalyst Precursors in Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) palladium dimers are presented as multipurpose Pd&#8208;precursors, ideally suited for catalytic method development and preparative organic synthesis. By simply mixing with phosphine or carbene ligands, they are  in situ  converted into well&#8208;defined monoligated complexes. Their catalytic performance was benchmarked against state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems in challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig, Heck, Suzuki and Negishi couplings, and ketone arylations. Their use enabled record&#8208;setting activities, beyond those achievable by optimization of the ligand alone. The MeNAP catalysts permit syntheses of tetra&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted arenes and bulky anilines in near&#8208;quantitative yields at room temperature, allow mono&#8208;arylations of small ketones, and enable so far elusive cross&#8208;couplings of secondary alkyl boronic acids with aryl chlorides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Constructing a Carbon&#8208;Particle&#8208;Modified Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhancing the Efficiency of CO2 Electroreduction into Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the catalytic performance of MOFs in CO2RR, a strategy to introduce suitable precursor to in situ generate carbon nanoparticles was adopted. Introduced carbon nanoparticles serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in the framework, and sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy gives impetus to construct more effective catalysts for electroreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been widely investigated, but insufficient conductivity limits application. Herein, a porous 3D In&#8208;MOF {(Me2NH2)[In(BCP)]&#8901;2&#8201;DMF}n (V11) with good stability was constructed with two types of channels (1.6 and 1.2&#8197;nm diameter). V11 exhibits moderate catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction with 76.0&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEHCOO&#8208;). Methylene blue molecules of suitable size and pyrolysis temperature were introduced and transformed into carbon particles (CPs) after calcination. The performance of the obtained CPs@V11 is significantly improved both in FEHCOO&#8208; (from 76.0&#8201;% to 90.1&#8201;%) and current density (2.2 times). Control experiments show that introduced CPs serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in framework, and benefit to sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy can also work on other In&#8208;MOFs, demonstrating the universality of this method for electroreduction of CO2.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Nickel&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both theoretical simulations and in&#8197;situ experiments demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode and improves the seawater oxidation stability.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and in situ experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion. The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ca. 5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.

         <title>Nucleophilic and Radical Heptafluoroisopropoxylation with Redox&#8208;Active Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active heptafluoroisopropoxylating reagents were conveniently prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines, and then were successfully used for the synthesis of a series of alkyl(aryl) heptafluoroisopropyl ethers.







Abstract
The heptafluoroisopropyl group (CF(CF3)2) is prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. However, heptafluoroisopropoxylated (OCF(CF3)2) compounds remain largely underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient access to these compounds. Herein, we disclose the practical and efficient heptafluoroisopropoxylation reactions through the invention of a series of redox&#8208;active N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. These reagents were readily prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines with AgCF(CF3)2. The substitutions on the nitrogen atom significantly affected the properties and reactivities of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. Accordingly, two types of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents including N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 phthalimide A and N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 benzotriazolium salt O&#8242; were used as OCF(CF3)2 anion and radical precursors, respectively. This protocol enables the direct heptafluoroisopropoxylation of a range of substrates, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Ratio&#8208;Dependent Chemodivergent Asymmetric Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis can be achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system.







Abstract
Chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis was achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system. Using N&#8208;(aroyloxy)phthalimide as the precursor of either an oxygen&#8208;centered aroyloxy radical or a nitrogen&#8208;centered phthalimidyl radical, enantioselective oxocyanation or aminocyanation of alkenes was achieved separately through a dual photoredox and copper catalysis. The metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio can exert chemoselective control while retaining the high enantiopurity of divergent products. Both reactions proceed efficiently with catalyst loading as low as 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% and can be performed on a gram scale without loss of chemoselectivity or enantioselectivity. Chemodivergent asymmetric 1,5&#8208;aminocyanation or 1,5&#8208;oxocyanation of vinylcyclopropane can also be realized by this protocol. Mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed to shed light on the stereochemical and chemodivergent results.

Chemodivergent asymmetric 1,5-aminocyanation or 1,5-oxocyanation of vinylcyclopropane can also be realized by this protocol. Mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed to shed light on the stereochemical and chemodivergent results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Induced Metal and Alloy Dual&#8208;Exsolution in Perovskite Ferrite Oxides Boosting the Performance of Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
CoFe alloy and Co metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide was obtained through a temperature dependent cation exchange reaction and exhibit superior Li&#8208;O2 battery performance, including higher specific capacity, lower overpotential, and obviously better cycling stability.







Abstract
A temperature&#8208;controlled cation&#8208;exchange approach is introduced to achieve a unique dual&#8208;exsolution in perovskite La0.8Fe0.9Co0.1O3&#8722;&#948; where both CoFe alloy and Co metal are simultaneously exsolved from the parent perovskite, forming an alloy and metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide. Mossbauer spectra show that cation exchange of Fe atoms in CoFe alloy and Co cations in the perovskite is the key to the co&#8208;existence of Co metal and CoFe alloy. The obtained composite exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity as Li&#8208;O2 battery cathode catalysts with a specific discharge capacity of 6549.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a cycling performance of 215&#8197;cycles without noticeable degradation. Calculations show that the combination of decorated CoFe alloy and Co metal synergistically modulated the discharge reaction pathway that improves the performance of Li&#8208;O2 battery.

         <title>Catalysis with Supramolecular Carbon&#8208;Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis was established as a new platform for organic synthesis. A class of versatile catalysts was discovered which showed catalytic capability in different benchmark reactions, thus demonstrating the wide potential of this catalysis strategy.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new catalysis platform, supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis, which exploits the highly directional weak interactions between carbon centers of catalysts and electron donors to drive chemical reactions. To demonstrate this catalysis approach, we discovered a class of cyclopropane derivatives incorporated with carbonyl, ester and cyano groups as catalysts which showed general catalysis capability in different types of benchmark reactions. Among these typical examples, a challenging tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization can be achieved by supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis. The co&#8208;crystal structures of catalyst and electron donors, comparison experiments, and titrations support a catalysis mode of carbon&#8208;bonding activation of Lewis basic reactants.
