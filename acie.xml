         <title>Integration of Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Adjacent Arene with Nitrogen/Carbonyl Framework for Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic luminescent materials featuring noncovalent through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) have attracted considerable attention. However, the presence of multiple vibrational energy levels and weak spatial electron delocalization typically results in broad emission peaks for TSC&#8208;based emitters, significantly impeding their extensive application in optoelectronic technologies. Herein, two TSC emitters, TSFQ&#8208;TRZ and TSFQ&#8208;Ph, were synthesized by integrating a fused nitrogen/carbonyl skeleton with adjacent arene 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TPTRZ) and phenyl group segments, through a rigid spiro spacer. These emitters exhibited narrow emissions, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum of 19 nm and 25 nm, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations unveiled that the TPTRZ segment introduces steric hindrance while simultaneously suppressing molecular vibrations via intramolecular interactions&#8212;a key factor in achieving narrow emissions. Leveraging this narrow blue emission, electroluminescent devices employing TSFQ&#8208;TRZ as the emitter achieved an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 26.7%, which further increased to 28.2% when sensitized by phosphorescent emitter. This work demonstrates highly efficient, narrowband emissions from TSC&#8208;based emitters, thereby expanding their potential applications in the electroluminescence field.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Origin of the Stretchability and Fatigue&#8208;Resistance of Rotaxane&#8208;Based Mechanically Interlocked Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked polymers exhibit various functionalities for promising applications. Notably, while enhanced stretchability and superior fatigue resistance have been primarily attributed to the sliding of rotaxanes, the intrinsic role of mechanical interlocking itself has remained underappreciated. Herein, densely crosslinked SPN and MIN systems are developed to reveal the interlocked architectures as the fundamental molecular mechanisms of mechanical enhancement.







Abstract
Rotaxane&#8208;based polymer networks leveraging host&#8211;guest recognition have recently emerged as a versatile platform for developing smart materials. Despite numerous studies on these polymers, their unique mechanical properties are mostly associated with the sliding motion of the macrocycle along the axle, leaving the impact of the presence or absence of interlocked structures on the mechanical performance of materials yet to be directly demonstrated. In this work, we present a densely (pseudo)rotaxane&#8208;based supramolecular polymeric network (SPN) and a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) as model systems to explore how the mechanical interlocking unit dominates the material properties. Specifically, we have achieved a significant transition from SPN to MIN by finely tuning the stopper size, just substituting a methyl with a dimethyl group attached to the phenyl ring. Although their stereochemical structures are similar, a subtle increase in the stopper size can lead to striking improvements in stretchability and anti&#8208;fatigue performance. The stopper size&#8208;relevant dethreading behavior, as evidenced by a combined approach of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and rheology, is the underlying molecular mechanism for the difference in the macroscopic mechanical properties. We anticipate that the fundamental understanding gained from this work will advance the development of rotaxane&#8208;based materials with emergent functions and applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nondirected and Regioselective Arylation of Internal Alkenes with Simple Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective insertion of (hetero) aryl groups into the C&#8722;C double bond of unactivated internal alkenes by nondirected arene&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H activation has been achieved. The design and development of a new ligand&#8208;supported palladium catalysis, enables quick access to trisubstituted alkenes, especially E&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylalkenes, from unfunctionalized simple raw materials in moderate to high yields, with excellent regio&#8208; and stereocontrol.







Abstract
Regioselective functionalization of internal alkenes has become a highly efficient approach for preparing stereochemically defined multi&#8208;substituted olefins. Unlike traditional methods that require directing groups, activating groups, or active chemical bonds (e.g., halide, pseudo halide, organometallic reagent, etc.), there remains a strong demand for nondirected and selective functionalization of unactivated alkenes with simple coupling partners, both in academic research or industrial applications. Herein, we report the development of a pyridone&#8208;oxazoline (Pyoox) type ligand that combines the features of both pyridone and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline in assisting Pd&#8208;catalyzed olefination. This ligand enables the activation of simple (hetero) arenes and internal alkenes within a single reaction system. A nondirected and regioselective arylation from simple raw materials has been achieved, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted olefins in moderate to excellent yields, with excellent regio&#8208;/stereocontrol. Experimental and computational studies on mechanisms offer insight into the distinctive properties and performance of this ligand&#8208;promoted catalysis. The synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the simplified synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Breaking the Limitation of Laminar Flow in Thrombolytic Therapy with Reconfigurable Vortex&#8208;Like Nanobot Swarms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the control of RMF, the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms move along the blood vessel wall toward the venous thrombus, disrupting the laminar flow near the thrombus. The released urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA) is then entrained by the rotating fluid induced by the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms, where it directly acts on the thrombus.







Abstract
Laminar blood flow represents the normal physiological state of blood circulation, but it also acts as a natural physiological barrier for the effective diffusion of drugs to the lesion site. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy in which reconfigurable vortex&#8208;like swarms of magnetic swimming nanobots actively disrupt the laminar flow to deliver drugs in a manner similar to how bacteria seek food. The drug was released from the cavity of biodegradable, submicron pentosan flask&#8208;like nanobots, aggregates as the dynamic rotating drug fluid under a rotating magnetic field. The vortex&#8208;like nanobot swarm successfully overcame the laminar barrier near the thrombus in a rat inferior vena cava stenosis thrombosis model, which was observed by ultrasound blood flow imaging. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of nanobots swarm for enhancing thrombolytic efficacy through drug aggregation after breaking the laminar flow was further confirmed in a rat deep vein thrombosis model. This bionic active targeting approach overcomes the laminar flow barrier and restricts the release of drugs by the swarm&#8208;induced vortex fluid to facilitate targeted drug delivery, which is expected to be an innovative method to enhance drug delivery efficiency.

         <title>Full&#8208;Scale Regulation Enabled High&#8208;Performance Sodium O3&#8208;Type Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full&#8208;scale regulation of O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is achieved through ternary&#8208;lattice&#8208;site doping combined with a perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 surface coating. This strategy optimizes the interlayer structure and establishes a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which further alleviating intrinsic lattice strain, suppressing disordered FeO64+ migration, and mitigating undesirable interfacial reactions. As anticipated, the as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF cathode demonstrates impressive rate capability and excellent cycle durability at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.1&#8197;V.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type cathodes hold considerable promise in achieving rapid commercialization due to high energy density. However, severe structural/interfacial deterioration, along with kinetic hindrance, typically resulting in rapid capacity fading and serious safety risk at elevated cut&#8208;off voltages. Herein, inspired from solubility limitation of hetero&#8208;elements, synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk multifunctionally full&#8208;scale modified O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is proposed to maintain its state of health (SOH). The perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 protective layer in situ formed on the surface of primary particles, helps to construct a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase architecture, mitigate the unexpected interfacial side reactions and prevent transition metal dissolution. Simultaneously, Ca2+ pillars, robust Zr&#8722;O bonds and the highly electronegative F&#8722; are adequately anchored into ternary lattice sites of Na&#8208;TM&#8722;O, respectively, thereby reinforcing the TMO6 octahedra and facilitating Na+ diffusion. Notably, the intrinsic lattice strain is effectively alleviated due to an additional intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8208;OP2. More impressively, migration of Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted Fe4+O6 is further restrained, originating from the strengthened coordination environment under deep&#8208;desodiation state. Consequently, as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF achieves an impressive rate capability and a remarkable capacity retention of 83.8&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 2&#8197;C. This elaborate work shed valuable insight into mechanism of regulating internal full Wyckoff&#8208;site and external surface structure for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced durability.

&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; migration, and mitigating undesirable interfacial reactions. As anticipated, the as-designed NFM-CZF cathode demonstrates impressive rate capability and excellent cycle durability at the high cut-off voltage of 4.1&#8197;V.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O3-type cathodes hold considerable promise in achieving rapid commercialization due to high energy density. However, severe structural/interfacial deterioration, along with kinetic hindrance, typically resulting in rapid capacity fading and serious safety risk at elevated cut-off voltages. Herein, inspired from solubility limitation of hetero-elements, synchronous surface-to-bulk multifunctionally full-scale modified O3-NaNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is proposed to maintain its state of health (SOH). The perovskite-type CaZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; protective layer in situ formed on the surface of primary particles, helps to construct a stable cathode-electrolyte-interphase architecture, mitigate the unexpected interfacial side reactions and prevent transition metal dissolution. Simultaneously, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; pillars, robust Zr&#8722;O bonds and the highly electronegative F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are adequately anchored into ternary lattice sites of Na-TM&#8722;O, respectively, thereby reinforcing the TMO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra and facilitating Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. Notably, the intrinsic lattice strain is effectively alleviated due to an additional intergrowth phase transition of P3-OP2. More impressively, migration of Jahn-Teller distorted Fe&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is further restrained, originating from the strengthened coordination environment under deep-desodiation state. Consequently, as-designed NFM-CZF achieves an impressive rate capability and a remarkable capacity retention of 83.8&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 2&#8197;C. This elaborate work shed valuable insight into mechanism of regulating internal full Wyckoff-site and external surface structure for sodium-ion batteries with enhanced durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Lithium Storage Performance of Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes through Synergistic Molecular Engineering and Nanostructure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immobilization of nanosized small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a novel strategy to achievehigh capacity, long lifespan, and superior rate capability. The N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation creates additional active sites and strengthens &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of SMOCCs nanoparticles on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring high theoretical capacities are promising cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but facing challenges in cycling stability and rate performance owing to their high solubility in organic electrolytes and low conductivity. Herein, we propose a novel architecture wherein nanosized SMOCCs with N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation are uniformly immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This approach leverages the N&#8208;heterocycles to create additional active sites and strengthen &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of nanosized SMOCCs on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration. As a demonstration, we synthesize a composite material using dipyrido[3&#8217;,2&#8217;:5,6;2&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;10,21&#8208;dione (DQDPD) as the active component, which exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties in LIBs, including an ultrahigh capacity of 505&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, exceptional cycle stability with 82&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability of 290&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1. Our approach, which integrates molecular engineering and nanostructure design, provides a novel paradigm for simultaneously realizing high capacity, long lifespan, and rapid rate capability in SMOCCs.

         <title>Weakening Solvent&#8208;Solute Interactions for High&#8208;Efficiency Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy was proposed to weaken the interaction between solvents and perovskite precursors through halogen ions. This leads to the improved efficiency of the optimized screen&#8208;printed device and mini&#8208;module to 21.8&#8201;% (0.05&#8197;cm2) and 18.95&#8201;% (12.6&#8197;cm2), respectively. This work opens a new avenue to improve the performance of screen&#8208;printed PSCs.







Abstract
Screen printing has emerged as a leading candidate for industrial&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics. However, strong solvent&#8208;solute interaction in conventional formulations accelerates the preferential crystallization of perovskites at points, hindering the progressive phase evolution from point to line to plane. In this work, we introduced halogen ions to weaken solvent&#8208;solute interactions, achieving the reduced Pb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O coordination strength counterbalanced by enhanced Pb&#8722;I bonding interactions. This weakened interaction delays formamidinium iodide participation in rapid phase transitions to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide, enabling controlled crystallization kinetics. The optimized screen&#8208;printed perovskite solar cells demonstrate remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 21.8&#8201;% for 0.05&#8197;cm2 devices and 18.95&#8201;% for 5&#8197;cm&#215;5&#8197;cm mini&#8208;modules (active area: 12.60&#8197;cm2). Furthermore, this strategy exhibits broad process compatibility, achieving 23&#8211;24&#8201;% PCEs for both blade&#8208;coating and spin&#8208;coating devices fabricated under ambient conditions (25&#8211;30&#8201;&#176;C, 35&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity). These breakthroughs highlight the universal potential of coordination engineering for scalable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Towards Surface&#8208;Enhanced Homogeneous Catalysis: Tailoring the Enrichment of Metal Complexes at Ionic Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article reviews strategies to deliberately anchor metal complexes at the liquid/vacuum&#8197;(gas) interface of ionic liquids in a buoy&#8208;like fashion; this surface enrichment is achieved by targeted functionalization of the catalytic complexes with surface&#8208;active ligands and the appropriate choice of the ionic liquid.







Abstract
When talking about homogeneous catalyst systems, it has long been assumed that the system at hand consists of a transition metal complex in solution with the liquid interface representing the composition of the bulk solution. Now, in light of considerable developments in the study of metal complexes dissolved in ionic liquids with their negligible vapor pressures, more detailed studies of the composition at the liquid/gas interface became possible. These investigations revealed pronounced surface enrichment and segregation effects of high relevance for practical applications. This article reviews recent advancements in tailoring the interfacial composition of ionic liquid&#8208;based catalytic systems. A particular focus is dedicated to surface enrichment phenomena, and a variety of parameters are presented for deliberate control of the local concentration of the complexes at the surface, that is, the nature of the ligands, the bulk concentration, the temperature, and the nature of the IL solvent. As experimental methods, angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and vacuum&#8208;based pendant&#8208;drop surface tension measurements were applied. The reviewed results are intended to provide the basis for the advancement of catalytic systems with high surface areas, such as in supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis, where the interface design is directly interconnected with catalytic performance.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Ferrocenyl Aminoalcohols: Simultaneous Induction of Multiple Types of Chirality by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral ferrocenes with a chiral aminoalcohol group was developed via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. The desired products were obtained in excellent yield with high enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) by using phosphine&#8211;olefin ligands with a planar chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold.







Abstract
Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring&#8208;opening of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin ligand consisting of a cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring&#8208;opening products in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of the starting 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring&#8208;opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring-opening of 1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine-olefin ligand consisting of a cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring-opening products in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of the starting 1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring-opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Communication between Enantiomeric Sergeants and Achiral Soldiers in Racemic Triblock Copolymers with Heterochiral Cores for Triggering Multiple Helicity Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different chiral communication pathways were found between the chiral sergeant and achiral soldier units in racemic S&amp;S system, which further in situ driven the multiple transitions of globally chiroptical properties of the racemic copolymer assemblies.







Abstract
Amplification of asymmetry in complex supramolecular/polymer system results from the delicate interplay of chiral and achiral structures. Here, a novel approach to the racemic sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S) effect, using enantiomeric sergeants (Sgt.) and achiral soldiers (Sold.), achieves unique precise control over both intensity and sign of global chirality. Chiroptical assemblies of different dimensions in racemic S&amp;S copolymers can be constructed in situ via polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA). We systemically investigated chiral communication pathways between chiral&#8208;chiral, chiral&#8208;achiral, and two oppositely configured azobenzene (Azo) segments, which robustly affect the global chiroptical activity of the racemic S&amp;S assemblies. Chain length&#8208;, Sgt./Sold. ratios&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;dependent CD/UV/Vis, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) results provided insights into the kinetics for chiroptical inversions. LC phase transitions, the helical preferences of the Sgt. and Sold. units, and the stability of the &#8220;chiral core&#8221; allow racemic S&amp;S copolymer assemblies to exhibit chiral conflict between heterochiral blocks in an enantioselective fashion.

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation via Polycitric Acid&#8208;based Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence, that polycitric acid&#8208;based carbon nanodot (CND) can pose on the properties of incorporated N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores was investigated. Phenazine was used as the probe chromophore, because of its well&#8208;understood redox chemistry. Striking differences in spectral and electrochemical properties upon reduction between phenazine incorporated within CND (P&#8208;CND) and free phenazine were observed.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up syntheses of carbon nanodots (CND) using solvothermal treatment of citric acid are known to afford nanometer&#8208;sized, amorphous polycitric acid&#8208;based materials. The addition of suitable co&#8208;reactants in the form of in situ synthesized N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores facilitates hereby the overall functionalization. Reports regarding the influence of CND on the properties of, for example, N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores are scarce. Thus, our incentive was to design a CND model that features phenazine (P&#8208;CND) &#8211; a well&#8208;known N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore &#8211; to investigate the influence of the CND matrix on its redox chemistry as well as photochemistry. The scope of our work was to go beyond investigating the electrochemical properties of the resulting P&#8208;CND by shedding light onto differences relative to nano&#8208;aggregates of phenazine (PNZNA), which served as reference. In particular, chemical as well as electrochemical reduction of PNZNA initiated a reaction cascade that affords the primary reduction intermediate, that is, the reduced and protonated (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. In accordance with existing literature, the final product of a bimolecular disproportionation was 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine (PNZ&#8208;H2). Reducing P&#8208;CND also resulted in the formation of (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. But, no evidence for a subsequent bimolecular disproportionation was gathered. Instead, (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901; as an integrative part of P&#8208;CND was found to be actively involved in a H2 generation reaction. A more than twofold increase in efficiency compared to PNZNA under identical conditions was the consequence.

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Polyester&#8208;Derived Alcohol into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals by Engineering Atomically Dispersed Pd Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreforming presents a promising strategy for upcycling waste polyester&#8208;derived alcohol into valuable chemicals. However, it remains a great challenge due to its low performance and unsatisfactory selectivity toward high&#8208;value C2 products. Here, we report the highly efficient and selective conversion of ethylene glycol (EG, a monomer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) to glycolaldehyde using atomically dispersed Pd species supported on TiO2 catalyst. A glycolaldehyde production rate of 5072 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with a selectivity of 90.0% and long&#8208;term durability can be achieved. Experimental and theoretical results show that Pd single atoms can enhance the photocatalytic activity by enriching the photogenerated holes, which are the dominant species for the selective oxidation of EG to glycolaldehyde. More importantly, the adsorption of EG molecules on the catalysts is significantly promoted, which is subsequently transformed into RO&#8226; radicals, a crucial intermediate in producing glycolaldehyde. Additionally, Pd single atoms on TiO2 enable the reduction of the glycolaldehyde desorption barrier, thereby facilitating high selectivity and inhibiting further oxidation to C1 products. This work provides new insights into the photocatalytic conversion of polyester wastes by atomic engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Circular Photogalvanic Effects in Two&#8208;dimensional Perovskite Ferroelectric&#8208;based Transistor toward Multi&#8208;state Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spintronics has long been an exciting branch of condensed matter science, among which the spin splitting of energy bands in an inversion asymmetric material endows the circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE) toward high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, we have successfully achieved gate&#8208;tunable CPGE in a biaxial perovskite ferroelectric (n&#8208;heptanamine)2CsPb2Br7 (1), involving the broken symmetry from its spontaneous polarization. Strikingly, under left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, this CPGE acquires a large anisotropy factor for photocurrents up to ~1.04, far beyond most organic semiconductors and chiral counterparts (&lt; 0.2). It is the large splitting coefficient along the ky direction (~1.476 eV &#197;) that contributes to the significant realization of CPGE in 1. Notably, this spin&#8208;based CPGE of 1 has been modulated via the gate&#8208;voltage manipulation in its transistor&#8208;type devices, leading to multi&#8208;state memory behaviors. That is, six distinct conductance states are obtained under circularly polarized light, containing the original, high/low&#8208;state responses L(&#8208;1,0,1) to the left circularly polarized light, as well as three right components R(&#8208;1,0,1). This study establishes a pathway for further exploration toward multi&#8208;state memory in the field of ferroelectric integrated devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Concentrated Alkali Hydroxide Electrolytes for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the salt concentration of an electrolyte to over 10 M brings new solute&#8208;solvent interactions that define an emerging class of super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes for rechargeable batteries. To this class we introduce a super&#8208;concentrated alkaline electrolyte. Nearly saturated with KOH (at 15 M), the aqueous solution displays a broad electrochemical stability window (&gt;2.5 V on Au) while retaining an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&gt;0.27 S/cm at 25 &#176;C). Without a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, we can confirm the role of electron transfer kinetics in determining the stability as opposed to the thermodyanmic effect computed based on activity coefficients. The compositionally simple solution also allows spectroscopies and ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation to identify a novel mechanism of OH&#8208; structural diffusion, where unlike the conventional Grotthuss mechanism through hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, electrostatic forces sustain proton hopping and break the common stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff. A high ZnO solubility in the electrolyte further mitigate the issue of passivation when a Zn anode is deeply discharged. These unique properties enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity &gt;10 Ah/cm2 at 40 mA/cm2 to meet practical needs of safe, inexpensive energy storage.</dc:description>

The compositionally simple solution also allows spectroscopies and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation to identify a novel mechanism of OH- structural diffusion, where unlike the conventional Grotthuss mechanism through hydrogen-bond networks, electrostatic forces sustain proton hopping and break the common stability-conductivity tradeoff. A high ZnO solubility in the electrolyte further mitigate the issue of passivation when a Zn anode is deeply discharged. These unique properties enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity &amp;gt;10 Ah/cm2 at 40 mA/cm2 to meet practical needs of safe, inexpensive energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation of Allyl Ethers: Optimization, Scope, Mechanism and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl ethers and allyl ethers are important motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods toward their synthesis, direct allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers is one of the most efficient approaches. In this study, one of two regioisomers, a vinyl ether or an allyl ether, could be obtained, depending on whether a Lewis acid co&#8208;catalyst was present. Furthermore, branched allyl ethers were smoothly prepared in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20:1 b/l, 99% ee) by synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) complex and a chiral Lewis acid catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;intersecting Photoclick Reactions for Bioorthogonal Labeling on Single Cells: Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide as a Photoswitchable Reporter</title>

         <dc:description>The advancement of ring&#8208;strain preloaded dipolaro&#8208;/dienophiles plays a crucial role in bioorthogonal chemistry, enabling multiple high&#8208;precision conjugations toward biomolecules simultaneously. However, durability of these ring&#8208;strain preloaded reagents in vivo is a concern, as the ring&#8208;strain is not reloadable once released during delivery process. In&#8208;situ conversion of light&#8208;energy into ring&#8208;strain is a promising approach to ensure both biostability and spatiotemporal control endowed by light. Herein, we advance a seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzene photoswitch, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), bridged by a sulphone moiety. The photoisomerization from Z&#8208;DBTDD to ring&#8208;strain&#8208;loaded E&#8208;DBTDD enables an accelerated cycloaddition with various photogenerated dipoles to establish novel photoclick reactions, featuring a dual&#8208;&#955; (405 nm + 445 nm) synergistic control. In reactions with monoarylsydnones, a higher photo&#8208;stationary ratio of E&#8208;DBTDD, achieved by varying the power density of 445 nm laser, presented an ultrafast cycloaddition rate (kE = 6.6 &#215; 107 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) with a 13.8&#8208;fold acceleration compared with Z&#8208;DBTDD, which is superior to established ring&#8208;strain reporters (e.g., BCN&#8208;OH, sTCO&#8208;OH, DBTD). Then, bioorthogonal photoclick labeling of DBTDD tagged artificial phospholipid on living cell membranes was realized at subcellular resolution via an essential dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting lithography with an elevated efficiency by adjusting the 445 nm power density.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Boron Enolates to Construct Acyclic All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enolates are ubiquitous intermediates in organic synthesis. Among them, boron enolates exhibit distinctive reactivity patterns and selectivities due to the presence of a boron atom, making their synthesis highly attractive. Although methods for accessing ketone&#8208; or ester&#8208;derived boron enolates are well&#8208;developed, much less progress has been made in the development of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates due to aldehydes' high tendency toward self&#8208;condensation. Therefore, the practical applications of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates are significantly hindered. We present herein an efficient method for the preparation of aldehyde&#8208;derived boron enolates via the 1,2&#8208;hydroboration of ketenes with boranes, avoiding the use of acidic R2BCl/R2BOTf and bases and leading to improved functional group tolerance. Utilizing this convenient protocol, we developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates, yielding a wide array of chiral aldehydes bearing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, which are prevalent in various natural products and bioactive molecules. The synthetic utility and practicality of this method are demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale reactions and asymmetric syntheses of the ent&#8208;5HT1A antagonist as well as biological activity studies in inhibiting the growth of plant pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Heli(aminoborane)s with Highly Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical molecular carbons (HMCs) possess high absorption/luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs/glum) and significant luminescence quantum yield (&#934;lum), resulting in a high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness (BCPL), which is essential for the development of CPL materials for practical applications. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;doped HMCs, named &#960;&#8208;extended heli(aminoborane)s (E[10]HAB&#8208;A, E[10]HAB&#8208;B and E[10]HAB&#8208;C), consisting of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended [10]helicene skeleton with alternating N and B atoms at the inner rim. The aromaticity, electronic structures, and photophysical properties of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C were systematically investigated through experiments and theoretical calculations. E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C displayed remarkable photophysical properties, including high molar extinction coefficient and bright narrowband emission. The isolated enantiomers of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C exhibited intense circular dichroism (CD) and CPL, in which E[10]HAB&#8208;A shows gabs and glum values up to 0.024 and 0.017, simultaneously with high &#934;lum of 82% and a narrow full width at half maximum of 16 nm. Accordingly, E[10]HAB&#8208;A exhibits a BCPL as high as 583 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, which is the largest value among the reported BN&#8208;doped HMCs. Our study indicates that inner rim BN&#8208;doping and &#960;&#8208;extension are effective strategies to achieve high &#934;lum and balanced glum values in HMCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Insertion of arynes into cyclic C&#8722;C bonds provides a straightforward approach for ring expansion with an ortho&#8208;phenylene moiety; however, the current scope of substrates has been restricted to enolizable ketones. Here we report the first example of aryne&#8208;insertion into non&#8208;enolizable ketones through Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond activation of benzocyclobutenones. 2&#8208;Haloaryl boronates were employed as an unconventional aryne precursor. The reaction shows a wide substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. The mechanistic studies reveal an interesting dual role of the Pd catalyst for both aryne generation and C&#8722;C bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Mn2+&#8208;based Scintillation Screens for X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators play a pivotal role in multiple &#64257;elds such as medical imaging, radioactive contaminant detection, non&#8208;destructive testing, high&#8208;energy physics and homeland security. However, the traditional inorganic scintillators are faced with the shortcomings of high fabrication cost and low light yield. In recent years, organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides have become the promising alternatives for their excellent luminescence properties, favorable air and irradiation stability, and low&#8208;cost preparation. Among them, organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) have attracted wide attention due to their particular flexible molecular structure design, easy synthesis and low toxicity. This minireview summarizes the latest progress in high performance Mn2+&#8208;Based scintillation screens. Herein, the scintillation mechanism of OIMnHs scintillators is firstly discussed. Then, the different synthesis methods of OIMnHs scintillators are briefly described. After that, the recent strategies of OIMnHs for forming scintillation screens applying to X&#8208;ray imaging are emphatically reviewed, in which recent fabrication progress and applications of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens were introduced and the structure&#8208;property relationship of these screens was discussed. Finally, the challenges of this new scintillator material are summarized, and the potential research directions for future exploration are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Atropisomerism in Triarylboranes: Lewis Base Assisted Rotation at C&#8722;B Stereogenic Axis in Asymmetrical Boron Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, properties and structural requirements for atropisomerism at the C&#8722;B bond in boron Lewis acids such as triarylboranes have been understudied so far. We report the first series of atropisomeric triarylboranes constituted of a naphthyl rotor and a dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl stator subunits, connected by a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis. Through systematic crystallographic, kinetic, photophysical and quantum chemical studies, the mechanisms, rates and barriers of diastereomerization and enantiomerization were determined.
The orthogonal arrangement between the naphthyl and the dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracene scaffold moiety hamper the rotation of these two moieties around their Csp2&#8722;B bonds, enabling chiral resolution leading to enantiopure triarylboranes of high configurational stability. Furthermore, we fully elucidated a Lewis&#8208;base assisted pathway controlling the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B stereogenic axis, enabling the atropisomerical behavior of these triarylboranes be controlled by a Lewis base.</dc:description>

         <title>Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the outstanding stability of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl&#160;substances (PFAS) paved the way for their widespread application in a huge variety of applications, it also resulted&#160;in their nickname "forever chemicals". The rising awareness for PFAS&#8208;related environmental and health concerns drives a discussion on the most effective ways to abate PFAS emissions into the environment, i.e. water, soil, and air, and remediation of contaminated matter. In order to address the knowledge gap regarding air pollution by PFAS, this minireview summarizes the current corpus of work in the field and outlines how catalysis can contribute to PFAS abatement in the gas phase. Beyond a mere collection of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, overarching challenges in catalytic PFAS removal are identified, spanning from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, i.e. C&#8208;F&#8208;bond activation, to heterogeneous catalysis, i.e. surface reactions at the gas&#8208;solid interface, to reaction engineering, i.e. scaling relations and technical hurdles. In addition, the article introduces concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles via Ethynyl Bonding for High&#8208;Fidelity Bioanalytical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While Au&#8208;S bonds have been widely applied in preparing gold nanoparticle (AuNP) bioconjugates for biosensing, cell imaging, and biomedical research, biothiols in complex biological environments can seriously interfere with the stability of the conjugates due to ligand exchange. Herein, we communicate a robust and fast strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates (PFCs) using the Au&#8208;C&#8801;C bond, which can be completed within two minutes. The resulting Au&#8208;C&#8801;C PFCs exhibited better stability and resistance to biothiols than the corresponding Au&#8208;S PFCs, and also demonstrated excellent stability in high salt concentration, a wide range of pH values, and varying temperatures. The mechanism of Au&#8208;C&#8801;C conjugation was confirmed using molecular dynamics simulation and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Au&#8208;C&#8801;C PFCs significantly improved the signal fidelity in an intracellular caspase imaging assay. Overall, the developed strategy provides a promising approach for constructing AuNP nanoprobes, allowing reliable detection and broadening the potential for diverse biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity and Magnetic coupling of Triangulene Dimers linked via para&#8208;Biphenyl Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triangulene and its homologues are promising building blocks for high&#8208;spin low&#8208;dimensional networks with long&#8208;range magnetic order. Despite the recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of coupled triangulenes, key parameters such as the number of organic linking units or their dihedral angles remain scarce, making further studies crucial for an essential understanding of their implications. Here, we investigate the synthesis and reactivity of two triangulene dimers linked by two (Dimer 1) or one (Dimer 2) para&#8208;biphenyl units, respectively, on a metal surface in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum environment. First&#8208;principle calculations and model Hamiltonians reveal how spin excitation and radical character depend on the rotation of the para&#8208;biphenyl units. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the successful formation of Dimer 1 on Au(111). Non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) measurements resolve the twisted conformation of the linking para&#8208;biphenyl units for Dimer 1. On the contrary, the inherent flexibility of Dimer 2 induces the planarization of the para&#8208;biphenyl, resulting in the spontaneous formation of two additional five&#8208;membered rings per dimer connected by a single C&#8208;C bond (Dimers 2&#180;).</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Ketenimine Intermediates as Active Catalysts in the Michael Addition of Unactivated Nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Michael addition of unactivated nitriles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is a challenging yet desirable strategy for installing alkyl cyano&#8208;groups (R&#8208;CN) in organic molecules. However, despite formidable efforts, using acetonitrile as a Michael donor in these reactions has remained a significant challenge. Herein, we report a highly active manganese(I) complex [(PCNHCP)Mn(CO)2H] (1), which chemoselectively catalyzes the 1,4&#8208;addition of unactivated nitriles (incl. acetonitrile) to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The developed methodology operates under mild conditions, does not require any additives or bases, features low catalyst loadings (1 mol %), fast reaction times (2&#8208;8 hours), and is compatible with a wide variety of functional groups, including halides, trifluoromethyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and (hetero)aryl groups. Extensive mechanistic studies revealed that after base&#8208;free activation of the nitrile, either the N&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;ketenimine (propionitrile or benzyl cyanide) or the C&#8208;bound manganese&#8208;cyanoalkyl (acetonitrile) complex is formed. The difference in stability of these two species explains why more sterically hindered and presumably less activated nitriles (i.e., propionitrile, and butyronitrile) show higher reactivity than their corresponding more activated congeners (i.e., acetonitrile). Finally, the practicality of our approach was demonstrated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent derivatizations of the obtained product into important organic motifs such as ene&#8208;lactams and tetrahydropyridines</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolite Blending: A New Approach to Direct Crystallization of Aluminosilicate Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as raw material in the interzeolite conversion/transformation method resulted in the collection of the required composite building&#8208;units of the CON&#8208;type topology, leading to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).







Abstract
Various synthesis methods for zeolites have been developed to date; however, precise control over aluminum (Al) content remains a significant challenge. For instance, in the case of CON&#8208;type zeolites, it is especially difficult to obtain a Si/Al ratio below a value of approximately 100 by direct synthesis, and below approximately 30 by post&#8208;treatment. In this study, we have developed a novel direct synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite having desired Al content by applying the interzeolite conversion/interzeolite transformation, wherein precursor zeolites that possess common composite building units (CBUs) with the target zeolite are employed as the Al and Si source. Initially, a single zeolite was utilized as a precursor, resulting in the successful synthesis of a high Al CON&#8208;type zeolite (Si/Al=40). Finally, we developed a novel synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite; blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as starting material in the IZC method led to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).

         <title>Synergistic Zn and MoS2 Tailored Co&#8722;N/C Environments Enabling Bifunctional ORR/OER Electrocatalysis for Advanced Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 composite catalyst was developed, leveraging the synergistic activation of Zn and MoS2 to optimize structure and electronic density. This significantly enhanced ORR/OER performance, achieving low overpotentials, ultra&#8208;high specific capacity, and long cycle life in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, demonstrating great potential for energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
To better adapt lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) and overcome their sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, designing efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic materials is essential. In this study, we successfully constructed a bifunctional ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 catalyst by tailoring the Co&#8722;N/C center with Zn incorporation and MoS2 encapsulation. Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co&#8722;N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS2 establishes Mo&#8722;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8722;N/C. In Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn and MoS2 synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO2 formation/decomposition, while Zn&#8242;s environmental adaptability and MoS2&#8242;s encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01&#8197;V, an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 25,026&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single&#8208;atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

         <title>Post&#8208;deposition Treatment of Sb2Se3 Enables Defect Passivation and Increased Carrier Transport Dimension for Efficient Solar Cell Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a post&#8208;deposition treatment process for Sb2Se3 solar cells. Upon this treatment, the P atoms from P2O5 not only passivate the defects in Sb2Se3 film but also bring (Sb4Se6)n ribbons closer together. This suppresses the carrier recombination and increases the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% for Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.







Abstract
Post&#8208;deposition treatment in thin film preparation can compensate for the inability of directly deposited films by fundamentally altering the chemical, electrical, morphological and defect properties. However, as an emerging photovoltaic material, the synthesis of Sb2Se3 film has so far been unable to effectively adjust the carrier transport and defect properties, thereby hindering performance improvement. In this study, we report that P2O5 can serve as a post&#8208;deposition treatment material to modify the chemical and electrical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films. Through experimental analysis, we discover that P atoms from P2O5 can occupy the Se vacancy and convert the deep&#8208;level anti&#8208;site defect (SbSe) to a shallower defect (PSe), rendering efficient defect passivation. Simultaneously, P&#8208;doping induced lattice distortion closes the ribbon spacing of (Sb4Se6)n, promoting efficient carrier transport from one dimension to three dimensions. This structure reduces the restriction of carrier transport in low&#8208;dimensional materials, which suppresses the carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination and improves the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% in thermal evaporation derived Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells. This study provides a novel strategy and guidance for passivating deep&#8208;level defects and modifying the crystal structure of low&#8208;dimensional solar cell materials.

         <title>Integrating Two Photochromics into One Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Synergistically Enhancing Multiple Photocatalytic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating porphyrin and triphenylamine photochromics together, a photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed. The COF can synergistically enhance generation of both &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 for broad photocatalytic aerobic oxidations, demonstrating that precisely integrating multiple photochromics into one COF is a powerful strategy for the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for wide photoreactions.







Abstract
While photocatalytic oxidations are a category of important reactions in wide chemical synthesis, the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for broad oxidation reactions is still of a great challenge. Herein, by rationally integrating two photochromics, porphyrin and triphenylamine, a three&#8208;dimensional photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed for photocatalytic oxidations. Characterization studies not only show the formation of a crystalline and three&#8208;dimensional porous framework, but also reveal its effective photochemical semiconductor properties derived from the porphyrin and triphenylamine moieties. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements indicate that the COF is an effective photocatalyst for the generation of both singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;). Synergistically enhanced efficiency in all photocatalytic reactions of photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of alkylbenzenes and silanes as well as thioanisoles, and cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction of N&#8208;phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline and indole is confirmed by both experimental and theoretical studies, demonstrating its promising potential for broad photocatalytic oxidation reactions.

The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical material is one of the core components for modern laser equipment. The second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and optical band gap are two key indicators of such materials. Herein, a wide band gap germanate, Li3(OH)PbGeO4, with the largest SHG intensity has been created successfully by hypoxic strategy via traditional hydrothermal reactions. The cations in this structure all coordinate with oxygen anions at their lowest coordination number, forming polar PbO3 triangular pyramid and noncentrosymmetric GeO4, LiO4 tetrahedrons. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 exhibits a remarkable SHG response of about 27&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), 54&#8201;% higher than the previous record. The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Structural analysis and PAWED calculations indicate that its strong SHG response is due to the synergistic effects from PbO3, GeO4 and LiO4 groups. Furthermore, Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93. Our work not only breaks the record of SHG intensity in germanates but also provides an effective strategy in exploring new inorganic optical functional crystals.

         <title>Highly Precise Prediction of Micro&#8208; and Supra&#8208;pKa Based on 3D Descriptors Integrating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor, explicitly vectorizes molecular environments around protons, capturing covalent, non&#8208;covalent, and solvent effects for precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions. H&#8208;SPOC achieves the highest accuracy across SAMPL benchmarks, resolves stereoelectronic anomalies, predicts crystal&#8208;phase pKa variations, and correlates pKa with reaction rates, selectivity and pharmacokinetics, expanding its potential applications in drug design, molecular catalysis and materials science.







Abstract
Accurate pKa prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems. However, existing models often face challenges in addressing subtle stereoelectronic effects and conformational flexibility. This study presents H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor that captures covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions and incorporates solvent effects to predict site&#8208;specific pKa values accurately. H&#8208;SPOC was validated on multiple benchmark datasets, including SAMPL6, SAMPL7, and SAMPL8, where it outperformed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. H&#8208;SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including 2&#8208;acetoxybenzoic acid (the main components of aspirin) non&#8208;equilibrium conformations, glycine&#8216;s microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra&#8208;pKa predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated pKa with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H&#8208;SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Selectively Activated Aromatic Rings for High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The Co&#8208;NTTA MOF (NTTA=5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings in diverse chemical environments, is synthesized as the high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate Li&#8208;ion battery anode. Both the NTTA ligands and Co cations participate in a 51&#8208;electron reversible redox reaction. The &#8220;structure&#8208;property&#8221; relationship is deeply elucidated, and for the first time, selective activation of different aromatic rings within a single MOF has been revealed.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered promising candidates for anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their designable structure, abundant active sites, and well&#8208;organized porosity. However, the structural factors governing active site utilization and Li&#8208;ion storage kinetics remain inadequately understood. In particular, the Li&#8208;ion storage behaviors of aromatic rings with high LUMO energy levels and situated in varying chemical environments remain a highly debated issue. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;based MOF (Co&#8208;NTTA, NTTA ligand: 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings situated in diverse local environments, is deliberately designed and synthesized. Experimental characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations have verified the occurrence of a reversible electrochemical reaction involving a total of 51 electrons among the NTTA ligands, cobalt cations, and Li+ ions. Unlike the traditional concept of superlithiation, the three inner aromatic rings are selectively activated by &#960;&#8208;aromatic conjugation networks and &#960;

&#960; stacking, contributing to a reversible 6&#8208;electron pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation reaction. Conversely, the three outer aromatic rings remain inert toward Li+ ions. Impressively, the Co&#8208;NTTA MOF anode, with selectively activated aromatic rings, delivers a reversible capacity of up to 956&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates exceptional high&#8208;rate durability, further supporting a 4.3&#8197;V lithium&#8208;ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor with high energy/power density.

         <title>Activating Organic Electrode for Zinc Batteries via Adjusting Solvation Structure of Zn Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ in organic electrolytes limits the Zn2+ storage performance of organic electrodes, particularly in thick electrodes with high mass loading. Here, adding 2&#8201;% H2O to an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O molecules into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly accelerating the de&#8208;solvation process and enabling the thick poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) electrode to exhibit high performance.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;organic batteries, combining the low cost and high capacity of Zn anodes with the tunable and sustainable properties of organic cathodes, have garnered significant attention. Herein, we present a zinc&#8208;organic battery featuring a poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) cathode, a Zn anode, and an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte, which delivers a high capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life (10,000 cycles) when tested with a low PBQS loading (2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The charge storage mechanism in the PBQS cathode involves solvated Zn2+ adsorption and consequent Zn2+ coordination with PBQS companied by de&#8208;solvation process, as confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis. However, sluggish Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation leads to a loss of Zn2+ coordination capacity when tested with higher PBQS loading (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) even at a low current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Remarkably, the addition of 2&#8201;% H2O to the DMF electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly facilitating the de&#8208;solvation process. As a result, the PBQS cathode (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) retains its Zn2+ storage capacity when using the modified electrolyte. This approach offers a new strategy for improving the rate performance of organic electrodes, complementing existing conductivity enhancements.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Skeletal Rearrangement via C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Activation to Access &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#948;/&#947;&#8208;Lactone</title>

         <dc:description>
We have developed a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed lactonization reaction to activate non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in cyclobutene and cyclopropane carboxylic acids. Using a dual ligand approach with pyridone&#8208;phosphine significantly boosts catalyst reactivity, creating a robust catalyst for unsaturated lactonization. This method shows excellent functional group tolerance and offers a straightforward, adaptable synthesis pathway for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactones. Computational studies provided mechanistic insights, identifying the TDI and TDTS, and revealing the role of dual ligands in facilitating the reaction.







Abstract
The activation of non&#8208;polar aliphatic C&#8722;C bonds represents a significant challenge that remains to be addressed in the field of Pd(II) catalysis. In this study, we present a dual ligand approach as a means of addressing this issue. The process entails lactonization of cyclobutane and cyclopropane carboxylic acid via the activation of non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond despite the high feasibility of both &#959;rtho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H and &#946; or &#947; &#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to reveal the mechanistic insights and elucidate the role of dual ligands in facilitating this challenging transformation.

         <title>Integrating Circular Polarized Luminescence and Long Persistent Luminescence in Cu8 Cage&#8208;Like Clusters via Ligand Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral cage&#8208;like Cu8&#8722;Cl clusters integrating circular polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) were successfully achieved via a stepwise ligand engineering approach. These are the first copper clusters to demonstrate both CPL and LPL properties, as well as the longest luminescent lifetime observed in copper clusters. This study emphasizes the importance of surface ligands in shaping the desired luminescent properties.







Abstract
Copper clusters with diverse luminescent properties are of particular interest. In this study, a series of Cu8 clusters with cage&#8208;like structures was synthesized and characterized. By employing a stepwise ligand engineering strategy that progressively introduced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties, we successfully synthesized R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8722;Cl, the first copper cluster to demonstrate both CPL and LPL. The CPL originates from the chiral metal core induced by the chiral alkynyl ligand, whereas the LPL is attributed to the inherent properties of chlorine&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine, which is retained and modified after ligation. The polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film containing Cu8 clusters displays lifetimes of up to 75.18&#8197;ms at room temperature and an afterglow exceeding 1.5&#8197;s, marking the longest luminescent lifetime recorded for molecular copper&#8208;cluster&#8208;based materials known to date. Additionally, R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8722;Cl shows excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence and variations in luminescence when UV light is switched on and off, highlighting its potential for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. This work not only presents innovative cage&#8208;like copper cluster structures but also offers new approaches for designing multifunctional clusters.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activated Orthogonal Proteolysis Chimeras for Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive enzyme&#8208;activated clickable PROTACs, enabling the in&#8197;situ formation of heterobifunctional degraders to disrupt epigenetic BRD4 proteins in the tumor only. Such clickable&#8208;PROTACs exhibit promising selectivity and superior penetration in tumors, effectively downregulating PD&#8722;L1 expression both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, offering potential for immunotherapy against tumor growth.







Abstract
Precise modulation of dynamic and complex tumor microenvironment (TME) to disrupt tumorigenesis and reshape intratumoral immune infiltration has emerged as promising approaches for enhanced cancer therapy. Among recent innovations, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a burgeoning chemical knockdown technology capable of degrading oncogenic protein homeostasis and inducing dynamic alternations within carcinoma settings, offering potential for antitumor manipulation. However, achieving selectivity in PROTACs that respond to disease environmental stimulation and precisely perturb on&#8208;target proteins remains challenging. The multi&#8208;step synthesis and limited permeability, attributed to high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight and heterobifunctional structures, further hinder their in&#8197;vivo efficacy. Herein, we present a unique TME&#8208;responsive enzyme&#8208;activated clickable PROTACs, which features a short peptide&#8208;tagged pomalidomide derivative to undergo tumor&#8208;specific cleavage by cathepsin protease to induce orthogonal crosslinking of the exposed cysteine with 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;labeled epigenetic protein&#8208;ligand JQ1, facilitating in&#8197;situ degrader formation within tumor regions only. Systematic protein profiling and proteomic analysis revealed that such TME&#8208;specific clickable&#8208;PROTACs not only selectively eliminate epigenetic proteins without tedious pre&#8208;synthesis to bridge disparate small&#8208;molecule bi&#8208;warhead fragments, but also demonstrated superior tumor penetration compared to conventional high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PROTACs. Importantly, these clickable&#8208;PROTACs efficiently downregulated immune checkpoint programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, remodeling TME for enhanced therapeutics, especially in anti&#8208;tumoral immunomodulation.

         <title>Enhanced Electroluminescence and Stability of Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive was engineered to regulate crystallization, passivate defects, and resist moisture in blue perovskites using the biomimetic additive 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA). As a result, sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit excellent operational and moisture stability, achieving a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Although remarkable breakthroughs have been witnessed in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), achieving efficient and stable blue PeLEDs still remains as a critical challenge to towards commercial applications. Inspired by the protection effect and water&#8208;repellent properties of swan feathers, 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA) has been designed as adsorbed functional molecule for blue perovskites, which can simultaneously enhance the electroluminescence performance and moisture stability. The HFUA molecule features a long&#8208;chain structure where the carboxylic acid group acts as an anchor, coordinating with undercoordinated lead atoms in blue perovskites. The fluorine atoms at the opposite end of the chain form ionic bonds with the halogen octahedron, thereby stabilizing the octahedral structure. In addition, HFUA adsorption lowers the adsorption energy of organic spacers on the perovskite lattice, optimizing the reduced&#8208;dimensional phase distribution to facilitate smooth exciton transfer. Furthermore, the unique molecular structure of HFUA, rich in fluorine atoms, enhances the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, effectively inhibiting moisture penetration and preventing perovskite hydrolysis. The target blue PeLEDs obtain a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm and exhibit greatly improved air stability under humid and high&#8208;temperature conditions.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional additive was engineered to regulate crystallization, passivate defects, and resist moisture in blue perovskites using the biomimetic additive 2H,2H,3H,3H-heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA). As a result, sky-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes exhibit excellent operational and moisture stability, achieving a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although remarkable breakthroughs have been witnessed in the field of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), achieving efficient and stable blue PeLEDs still remains as a critical challenge to towards commercial applications. Inspired by the protection effect and water-repellent properties of swan feathers, 2H,2H,3H,3H-heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA) has been designed as adsorbed functional molecule for blue perovskites, which can simultaneously enhance the electroluminescence performance and moisture stability. The HFUA molecule features a long-chain structure where the carboxylic acid group acts as an anchor, coordinating with undercoordinated lead atoms in blue perovskites. The fluorine atoms at the opposite end of the chain form ionic bonds with the halogen octahedron, thereby stabilizing the octahedral structure. In addition, HFUA adsorption lowers the adsorption energy of organic spacers on the perovskite lattice, optimizing the reduced-dimensional phase distribution to facilitate smooth exciton transfer. Furthermore, the unique molecular structure of HFUA, rich in fluorine atoms, enhances the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, effectively inhibiting moisture penetration and preventing perovskite hydrolysis. The target blue PeLEDs obtain a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm and exhibit greatly improved air stability under humid and high-temperature conditions. Our findings provide a unique and effective strategy for producing efficient and stable blue PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of NIR&#8208;II Fluorophores by a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) Coupling Reaction Driven by Charge&#8208;Transfer Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) coupling reaction driven by charge transfer interaction between the substrates has been developed that can afford mono&#8208; or di&#8208;substituted products depending on the reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations reveal the important role played by the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex in this reaction. The method was used for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse and novel NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.







Abstract
Here, we report a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) coupling reaction driven by charge transfer interaction. Due to the strong intermolecular noncovalent interaction, an essential electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex is formed, confirmed solidly by absorption spectra, 1H NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The EDA complex lowers the activation barrier (Ea=9.17&#8197;kcal/mol) and facilitates the formation of the C&#8722;C bond, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step revealed by H/D and 12C/13C KIE studies. Kinetic investigations reveal that the reaction is a second&#8208;order reaction. Furthermore, high&#8208;level theoretical calculations support the proposed mechanism. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted products were obtained by varying the reaction conditions. A series of structurally diverse and novel second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores based on benzo[1,2&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;c&#8217;]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (BBTD) were synthesized by utilizing this coupling reaction.

         <dc:description>
The challenging C3&#8208;hydroxylation of valuable aza&#8208;arene cores is presented. Nucleophilic dearomatized intermediates react with electrophilic peracids and peroxides in a highly regioselective manner. This protocol is distinguished by its broad scope, exceptional regioselectivity, scalability, and potential for late&#8208;stage diversification.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocycles holds considerable importance in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recently, the regioselective introduction of various functionalities at the meta&#8208;position of azines, utilizing readily accessible dearomatized intermediates, has emerged as a highly attractive approach. Along these lines, the meta&#8208;hydroxylation of azines is an appealing but challenging transformation due to the inherent electronic nature of these heterocycles. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;selective hydroxylation of pyridines, quinolines and isoquinolines through easily accessible oxazinoaza&#8208;arene intermediates. The nucleophilic C3&#8208;position of these dienamine&#8208;type intermediates engages in highly regioselective hydroxylation upon treatment with electrophilic peroxides.

         <title>Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction on M3N@C80 (M=Lu, Sc): Reactivity and Reversibility Enable Chemical Separation of Metallofullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction on M3N@Ih&#8208;C80 (M=Lu, Sc) has been utilized to yield [5,6]&#8208;closed [4+2] cycloadducts that were fully characterized (HPLC, MS, UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations). The unique reactivity and thermal reversibility of endohedral metallofullerenes enable an efficient separation strategy, thereby advancing scalable synthesis for future applications.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes are chemically more inert compared to empty fullerenes, primarily due to their intramolecular electron transfer. In this work, we report an inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction on M3N@C80 (M=Lu, Sc), where they show significantly higher reactivity than empty fullerenes. The molecular structures of the [4+2] cycloadducts were unambiguously characterized. Moreover, the cycloadducts can fully revert to pristine M3N@C80 via retro&#8208;cycloaddition upon thermal treatment. With the unusual reactivity and reversibility, the IEDDA reaction enables an effective separation approach for metallofullerenes from their soot extracts, opening path to efficient and economical scale&#8208;up synthesis of metallofullerenes in laboratory and industrial settings.

         <title>Degradable Adhesives as Sustainable Alternatives to Acrylics via Ring&#8208;Opening Radical Polymerization of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) using vinylcycloproapne&#8208;based monomers and a crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesion and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs.







Abstract
Acrylic pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are loosely crosslinked polymer networks widely used across various industries. However, the network structure and inert nature of the acrylic polymer backbone present sustainability challenges. To address these issues, efforts are being made to incorporate degradable units into the polymer backbone. Yet, two key obstacles remain: i) the polymer does not degrade into sufficiently small fragments, and ii) the adhesive and viscoelastic properties are often inferior to those of conventional acrylic polymers. In this study, we developed a PSA utilizing vinylcyclopropane (VCP)&#8208;based monomers and a VCP&#8208;based crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesive performance and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs. Under optimized polymerization conditions, the polymer incorporates ozone&#8208;labile double bonds into its backbone, enabling controlled molecular degradation without compromising its properties. By synthesizing and strategically combining various VCP&#8208;based monomers, we developed PSAs with tailored adhesion and viscoelastic behavior on par with conventional acrylic PSAs. These advancements indicate that the degradable polymers and PSAs developed in this study are poised for practical application in the near future.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Epoxidation of Aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Diazosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides have been developed, which has overcome racemic background reaction. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports ligand acceleration. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic epoxidation of readily available aldehydes with diazo compounds is an atom economical strategy to synthesize epoxides. However, the asymmetric epoxidation reaction of aldehydes and fluorinated diazo compounds is challenging, because of the severe racemic background reaction. Herein, we report the first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports the ligand acceleration and the achievement of high enantioselectivity with a chiral ligand possessing lower enantiopurity. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.

&lt;p&gt;The first Cu(I)-catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;-trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides have been developed, which has overcome racemic background reaction. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports ligand acceleration.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic epoxidation of readily available aldehydes with diazo compounds is an atom economical strategy to synthesize epoxides. However, the asymmetric epoxidation reaction of aldehydes and fluorinated diazo compounds is challenging, because of the severe racemic background reaction. Herein, we report the first Cu(I)-catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;-trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports the ligand acceleration and the achievement of high enantioselectivity with a chiral ligand possessing lower enantiopurity. The gram scale reaction and down-stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Urea Complete Conversion to Compound Fertilizer in Industrial&#8208;Scale Tandem Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An industrial&#8208;grade tandem system was developed to fully convert urea (or urea wastewater) into compound fertilizer while generating H2. In a typical cycle, 200&#8197;g of urea was used to produce 232&#8197;L of pure H2 and 1580&#8197;g of solid compound fertilizer (KH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4) without further separation. The core is to develop an electrocatalyst (S&#8208;NiOOH&#8208;Ni(OH)2) with exceptional activity for urea oxidation.







Abstract
A compound fertilizer with NH4H2PO4 and KH2PO4 offer significant advantages in enhancing both crop yield and quality. Ammonia (NH3) is essential for the synthesis of the compound fertilizer, which was produced by an energy intensive chemical process. Developing efficient and environmental friendly methods to produce ammonia&#8208;containing compound fertilizers is crucial and extremely challenging. Here, we present a tandem catalysis system capable of achieving complete conversion of abundant urea into compound fertilizer in industrial&#8208;scale reactors by combining electrochemical and subsequent chemical processes. In a typical cycle, with the use of 200&#8197;g urea, 1580&#8197;g of solid compound fertilizer (KH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4) and 232&#8197;L of pure H2 are produced without any further separation process. The key to the realization of this system is to precisely control the rate of urea consumption and NO2&#8722; formation in electrochemical process. By maintaining a precise molar concentration ratio of urea to NO2&#8722; at 1/2 in electrolyte, urea can completely react with NO2&#8722; to form N2, while CNO&#8722; can be converted into NH4+ to form compound fertilizer in the second step of H3PO4 treatment, achieving complete conversion of urea without by&#8208;products formation. This method remarkably reduces H2 production potential while allowing for extraction of ammonia from urea&#8208;containing wastewater or urine to create pure compound fertilizer at an anticipated lower price than that of current market.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Reactivity in Dense Methane&#8208;Nitrogen Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are among the most abundant elements in the solar system, and our understanding of their interactions is fundamental to prebiotic chemistry. CH4 and N2 are the simplest archetypical molecules formed by these elements and are both markedly stable under extremes of pressure. Through a series of diamond anvil cell experiments supported by density functional theory calculations, we observe diverse compound formation and unexpected reactivity in the dense CH4&#8208;N2 system. Above 7GPa two concentration&#8208;dependent molecular compounds emerge, (CH4)5N2 and (CH4)7(N2)8, held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Strikingly, further compression at room temperature irreversibly breaks the N2 triple bond, inducing the dissociation of CH4 above 140GPa, with the nearquenched samples revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of strong covalently bonded C&#8208;N&#8208;H networks. High temperatures vastly reduce the required pressure to promote the reactivity between CH4 and N2, with NH3 forming together with longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons at 14GPa and 670K, further decomposing into powdered diamond when temperatures exceed 1200K. These results exemplify how pressuredriven chemistry can cause unexpected complexity in the most simple molecular precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Biosynthesis and Function of an Autoinducing Peptide in Clostridium acetobutylicum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the biosynthetic pathway of Ca&#8208;AIP, an accessory gene regulator (Agr)&#8208;type autoinducing peptide in Clostridium acetobutylicum. Two CAAX metalloproteases and one signal peptidase were identified to be responsible for the second processing step in Ca&#8208;AIP biosynthesis. By manipulating Ca&#8208;AIP levels, we demonstrate its significant effect on butanol production.







Abstract
Clostridia produce autoinducing peptides (AIPs) regulated by the accessory gene regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, playing a critical role in intercellular communication. However, the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory functions of clostridial AIPs remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we employed chemical quantification, genetic investigations, and in vitro reconstitution experiments to elucidate the native Ca&#8208;AIP in Clostridium acetobutylicum, a prominent industrial producer of acetone, butanol, and ethanol. Our findings identified a signal peptidase (Cac1760) and two CAAX metalloproteases (Cac0077 and Cac2478) as key players in N&#8208;terminal cleavage, while AgrB was found to be essential for C&#8208;terminal processing during Ca&#8208;AIP biosynthesis. Notably, overexpression of agrBD led to a 4.4&#8208;fold enhancement in Ca&#8208;AIP formation, which corresponded with an increase in butanol production from 12.5 to 14.9&#8197;g/L, while preserving vegetative cell morphology. The direct involvement of Ca&#8208;AIP in both butanol production and maintenance of cell morphology was further validated through exogenous supplementation. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the biosynthesis of AIPs and propose a promising strategy for optimizing microbial processes in industrial applications.

         <title>Spin State Regulation for Peroxide Activation: Fundamental Insights and Regulation Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the basics of spin state theory and its key influencing factors, including crystal field, ligand environment, and valence changes. It further discusses how spin state affect peroxide activation by altering adsorption energy, energy barriers, and electron transfer, ultimately enhancing selective ROS generation for more sustainable peroxide&#8208;based oxidation applications.







Abstract
Peroxides are widely used in environmental applications due to their strong oxidizing properties, however, traditional activation methods often face challenges such as uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and high energy barriers. Recent advancements in spin state regulation provide a promising alternative to enhance the efficiency of peroxide activation. This review provides an overview of spin fundamentals and discusses the key factors affecting spin state in catalytic materials, including crystal field configuration, ligand environment, and valence changes. Subsequently, the role of electron spin state in peroxide activation is comprehensively analyzed, with a focus on how spin state regulation can tune adsorption energy, lower energy barriers, facilitate electron transfer between transition metals and peroxides, and promote selective ROS generation. Finally, this review briefly outlines the practical applications of peroxide activation in water treatment and concludes with a summary and perspectives on future research directions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of spin state regulation in advancing peroxide activation strategies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a step&#8208;edge guided homoepitaxy mechanism to precisely regulate nucleation, growth and the reversibility of Zn anode, which enables ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. The resultant Zn(0002) epitaxy achieves unprecedented reversibility and stability over thousands of hours in Zn metal batteries. Reversible electrochemical epitaxy may bring breakthrough toward energy&#8208;dense metal batteries.







Abstract
Metal anodes are of profound impact towards the realization of energy&#8208;dense rechargeable batteries. However, the &#8220;hostless&#8221; metal redox always presents the disordered plating/stripping, aggravated by the side reactions and local anisotropy that cause the formation of excessive dendrites/voids and quickly lead to battery failure. Here we report step&#8208;edge guided homoepitaxy enabling ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Zn plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. Through engineering the atomic terrace height on the mono&#8208;oriented Zn(0002) foil anodes, both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane epitaxy aligned to the underlying Zn lattice are demonstrated via the favored edge nucleation and strong interfacial interaction driven by the surface/interface energy minimization, achieving the electrochemical homoepitaxy of continuous, submillimeter&#8208;scale Zn(0002) crystal with nearly 100&#8201;% theoretical density. Accordingly, we achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;%, high depths of discharge exceeding 51&#8201;% and 82&#8201;% along with record&#8208;high lifetimes of over a thousand and hundreds of hours, respectively, in zinc metal batteries. The breakthrough results provide new insights on the intrinsic metal plating/stripping from the view of reversible homoepitaxy for rechargeable energy&#8208;dense metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a step-edge guided homoepitaxy mechanism to precisely regulate nucleation, growth and the reversibility of Zn anode, which enables ordered layer-by-layer plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. The resultant Zn(0002) epitaxy achieves unprecedented reversibility and stability over thousands of hours in Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Achieving Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution Phase from Carbon Dots Confined in Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step high&#8208;temperature coprecipitation method is firstly developed to encapsulate citrate&#8208;derived carbon dots into NaYF4 nanocrystals, which protects the triplet excitons of carbon dots from quenching and provides a stable environment for room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in solution phase.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted growing interest in the construction of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. However, in the solution phase of CDs, it is still challenging to obtain efficient and stable phosphorescent emission due to the intense quenching effect by dissolved oxygen and solvent molecules. Herein, we report robust phosphorescence in the solution phase, achieved by encapsulating citrate&#8208;derived CDs into NaYF4 nanocrystals via a one&#8208;step method of high&#8208;temperature coprecipitation. Combined characterizations show that the triplet emission from CDs is related to the abundance of C=O in the CDs, the formation of ionic&#8208;bond networks around the CDs, and the spatial confinement and quenching inhibition effects of NaYF4 nanocrystals. Notably, the transition of CDs@NaYF4 from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity can be easily achieved by simple surface modulation of NaYF4 nanocrystals, which allows the RTP of CDs to be maintained in either polar or nonpolar solvents. In addition, CDs@NaYF4 exhibits stable afterglow in different pH environments, suggesting its excellent stability. Finally, we demonstrated the application of CDs@NaYF4 in 3D printing, oily anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns, and cell imaging. Our work can serve the controllable preparation of solution&#8208;phase RTP materials and their various applications.

         <title>Crystallization Thermodynamics Regulation of 1.85&#8197;eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for Efficient and Stable Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;band gap perovskite with high Br content features rapid crystallization, resulting in poor film quality due to the uncontrolled intermediate phases. However, a diammonium salt additive can improve film uniformity and crystallization of perovskite effectively, reducing phase segregation and voltage loss in perovskite&#8208;organic tandem solar cells.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;band gap perovskite with adjustable band gaps can be integrated with organic solar cells to form tandem solar cells (TSCs), thereby surpassing the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, increasing Br content to elevate the band gap above 1.8&#8197;eV complicates crystallization, leading to inferior film quality and defects due to the unmanageable evolution of intermediate phases. Surface passivation improves crystallization but hard to moderate the inhomogeneous component distributions and defects in the bulk phase. Here, we introduce a diammonium salt as an additive to regulate the homogeneity and crystallization of perovskite film, eliminating the low&#8208;dimensional intermediate phase for orientated crystallization of 1.85&#8197;eV perovskite, resulting in efficient wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells with an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.379&#8197;V and operational stability remaining 85&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after illumination for 1200&#8197;h. Furthermore, perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.03&#8201;% and a high Voc of 2.108&#8197;V, one of the highest Voc for perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs.

         <title>Manipulating the dynamics of chiral molecular bearings through subtle structural changes of guest molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isotropic rotation of a diamondoid molecule within a cylinder array was hindered by subtle structural changes introduced through a fluorine substituent. This bias in rotation induced precession with its direction controlled by an external electric field.







Abstract
By introducing fluorine substituents, anisotropic rotational motion was induced in diamondoid guests trapped in cylindrical hosts arranged in a 2D honeycomb crystal. Despite the subtle structural changes, the substituent hindered flipping motions in the host and biased its rotations toward tilted precession. The fluorine substituent facilitated the dielectric response of the crystal, as revealed through dielectric constant measurements, which provided insight into the detailed dynamics of the anisotropic rotations. The up&#8208;down flipping motion of the guest within the 2D crystal was constrained by an energy barrier but remained manipulable under an external electric field. Consequently, the angular momentum of the spinning guest, with its C&#8722;F pole, was forced to align with the applied electric field.

         <title>Upcycling Polynorbornene Derivatives into Chemically Recyclable Multiblock Linear and Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for upcycling crosslinked pDCPD and linear polynorbornene derivatives into recyclable multiblock crosslinked and linear polymers is reported. This work is accomplished through polymer deconstruction into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks and their repolymerization in different feed ratios. The obtained materials show highly tunable mechanical properties.







Abstract
Synthetic polymers have found widespread use, but their ineffective end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment is causing a significant environmental and human health crisis. Here, we demonstrate the upcycling of polynorbornene derivatives (pNBEs) through their deconstruction into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks that can be repolymerized into chemically recyclable pNBEs&#8208;like multiblock polymers via dehydrogenative polymerization. The resulting materials exhibit diverse mechanical properties, while integrating high melting temperatures (Tm as high as 133&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, this method could also enable the selective deconstruction of permanently cross&#8208;linked polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets into telechelic&#8208;OH functionalized oligomers, overcoming the significant challenges posed by their robust network structure in recycling and degradation. The resulting pDCPD oligomers can subsequently be repolymerized with macrodiols to create multiblock thermosets with tunable mechanical properties, including Young's modulus and tensile elongation. After use, upcycled plastics could be effectively deconstructed back to the oligomers for recovery and repolymerization. Overall, this work establishes an approach that can be utilized to upcycle pNBEs into previously inaccessible multiblock thermosets and thermoplastics with full recyclability, and may be generalizable to a range of polymers to shift their end&#8208;of&#8208;life waste disposal toward sustainable recovery and reuse.

         <dc:description>Toxicity remains one of the major challenges that prevent Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites from widespread utilization. Ideally, non&#8208;toxic alternatives can be identified while still maintaining the superior power conversion efficiency of the Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using the currently most promising candidate, the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites, as an example, we show that a trade&#8208;off exists between toxicity and efficiency in the Sn&#8208; versus Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites. Indeed, the dominant nonradiative recombination center in the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites differs from the one in its Pb&#8208;based counterparts, resulting in the nonradiative capture coefficient in CsSnI3&#160;being an order of magnitude higher than that in CsPbI3. We attribute this difference to the band alignment. Our results indicate that development of halide perovskites beyond the Pb and Sn bases is essential for efficient yet environmentally friendly perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pallada&#8208;electrocatalysis enables distal regioselective and atroposelective olefination reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective and enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization is a valuable method for synthesizing chiral and complex molecules. However, it often requires large amounts of toxic oxidants and high temperature, making it environmentally and economically adverse. Additionally, these traditional approaches generally suffer from regioselectivity and enantioselectivity issues. To overcome these limitations, a new mechanism is needed to control both of these simultaneously. Herein, we report the first Pd catalyzed regioselective distal and atroposelective olefination of simple arenes/biaryls via an electrooxidative reaction pathway. This unique electro&#8208;oxidative strategy with Pd(II) catalysis demonstrates unprecedented access to &#8216;regio&#8208;resolved&#8217; reactions, furnishing chiral molecule synthesis under dynamic kinetic resolution without the conventional requirement of metal&#8208;based oxidants and thermal energy. Both electroanalytical studies and DFT calculations suggest the involvement of a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle via a crucial Pd(III) intermediate that initiates both the distal and atroposelective olefination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Lanthanide&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer for Nanocrystal&#8208;Sensitized Organic Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitized organic photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) shows significant potential for energy conversion and photocatalysis, but achieving efficient upconversion across multiple wavelengths with single&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report a strategy utilizing lanthanide&#8208;doped nanocrystals (LnNCs) to sensitize TTA upconversion in multiple organic emitters under NIR excitation, achieving an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of up to 1.1 eV. This approach leverages a cascade lanthanide&#8208;triplet energy transfer design, adopting an interfacial energy transfer pathway via lanthanide ions to surface energy relay molecules for extended triplet sensitization. It allows consecutive transfer of photon energy from LnNCs to TTA emitters, mitigating energy mismatch between the triplet levels of emitters and excitation photon energies. The use of LnNCs enhances energy transfer efficiency through the unique spin&#8208;orbital coupling and narrow&#8208;band absorption properties of lanthanide ions. Our approach offers tunable upconversion emission, minimized energy loss during sensitization, and improved chemical stability of LnNCs. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this system in NIR&#8208;induced photopolymerization, showcasing its potential for applications such as 3D printing and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical proteomics reveal human off&#8208;targets of fluoroquinolone induced mitochondrial toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are an important class of potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their general use is more and more limited by adverse side effects. While general mechanisms for the fluoroquinolone&#8208;associated disability (FQAD) have been identified, the underlying molecular targets of toxicity remain elusive. In this study, focusing on the most commonly prescribed FQs Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, whole proteome analyses revealed prominent mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells, specifically of the complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC). Furthermore, global untargeted chemo&#8208;proteomic methodologies such as photo&#8208;affinity profiling with FQ&#8208;derived probes, as well as derivatization&#8208;free thermal proteome profiling, were applied to elucidate human protein off&#8208;targets of FQs in living cells. Accordingly, the interactions of FQs with mitochondrial AIFM1 and IDH2 have been identified and biochemically validated for their contribution to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, the FQ induced ETC dysfunction via AIFM1 activates the reverse carboxylation pathway of IDH2 for rescue, however, its simultaneous inhibition further enhances mitochondrial toxicity. This off&#8208;target discovery study provides unique insights into FQ toxicity enabling the utilization of identified molecular principles for the design of a safer FQ generation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Classical aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction generally involves excess reductants. Herein, we developed a visible light&#8208;induced catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction via a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;assisted direct excitation of imines without additional reductants, enabling the carbon&#8211;iodine bond cleavage of iododifluoromethyl ketones and the subsequent enantioselective radical coupling. This protocol provided an ingenious access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino ketones containing a gem&#8208;difluorine moiety. The mechanistic studies including radical trapping experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance experiment, cyclic voltammetry experiment and spectroscopic analysis rationalized the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic&#8208;fence Effect in Au Nanoparticle&#8208;loaded UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemoselective reaction are vital for fine chemicals, which requires economical and environmentally friendly catalysts. In order to improve the selectivity of multi&#8208;reaction competition, herein, we propose a novel ionic&#8208;fence strategy to synthesize heterogeneous catalyst for efficient hydrogenation. Practically, UIO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) modified with pyridinium&#8208;linker has been constructed through post&#8208;synthetic chains with paired anion via quaternization and ion exchange to form ionic&#8208;fence MOF (IFMOF&#8208;Cl), which can manage the adsorption mode of nitro substrate, further confine the formation of metal nanoparticles with high dispersity. The optimal Au@IFMOF&#8208;Cl catalyst demonstrates satisfactory selectivity for hydrogenation of nitro group compared to acetylene group in 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene, specifically, it owns a high yield of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (~97%) with ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880 h&#8208;1 TOF) and long stability, far superior to other catalysts without ionic fence effect. Adsorption experiments and density functional theory studies reveal that the incorporation of ionic fence could modulate the adsorption energy of nitro group, which is responsible for the high selectivity enhancement. Notably, this ionic&#8208;fence strategy exhibits comprehensive universality towards a wide range of substrates (23 kinds in total), providing a promising avenue for precisely engineering the internal microenvironments of catalysts to achieve highly selective synthesis of fine chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Hole&#8208;Mediated Lattice Oxygen Redox Design for Perovskite Oxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Present design and application of perovskite oxide catalysts assume lattice oxygen redox (LOR) mechanisms that depend on lattice oxygen activity without consideration of the entire redox cycle. Herein, using in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we uncover a hole&#8208;mediated LOR cycle on p&#8208;type Sr&#8208;deficient SrFeO3&#8211;&#948; (SFO&#8208;Srv) perovskites in CO oxidation reaction. Sr vacancies activate surface lattice oxygen of SFO&#8208;Srv and promote formation of highly covalent Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites. In situ electrical conductivity measurement demonstrates that holes directly participate in the entire LOR cycle, and are reversibly consumed and regenerated in reducing/oxidizing atmosphere via Fe(4&#8211;x)+&#8208;O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites of SFO&#8208;Srv. Hole&#8208;mediated LOR in SFO&#8208;Srv, as revealed by in situ soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, occurs through changing in covalency of Fe&#8208;O bonds, O 2p hole state, and electron density of Fe sites. 18O2 labeling experiment further confirms an improved Mars&#8208;van Krevelen pathway in the hole&#8208;mediated LOR cycle, which accounts for a ten&#8208;times enhancement of SFO&#8208;Srv for CO reaction rate over that of SFO alone.</dc:description>

In situ electrical conductivity measurement demonstrates that holes directly participate in the entire LOR cycle, and are reversibly consumed and regenerated in reducing/oxidizing atmosphere via Fe(4&#8211;x)+-O(2&#8211;x)&#8211; sites of SFO-Srv. Hole-mediated LOR in SFO-Srv, as revealed by in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, occurs through changing in covalency of Fe-O bonds, O 2p hole state, and electron density of Fe sites. 18O2 labeling experiment further confirms an improved Mars-van Krevelen pathway in the hole-mediated LOR cycle, which accounts for a ten-times enhancement of SFO-Srv for CO reaction rate over that of SFO alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Spillover Promotes Stable Synthesis of Vinyl Chloride on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru single&#8208;atom catalysts hold great promise for the robust synthesis of vinyl chloride through acetylene hydrochlorination. However, the easy over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during reaction suppress the catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we have synthesized an oxygen doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst by a sequential oxygen etching strategy, which delivers the remarkable yield of vinyl chloride monomer (&gt;99.38%) and stability (&gt;900 h, 180 h&#8208;1), far beyond those reported Ru counterparts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the asymmetric structure of single&#8208;atom Ru promotes an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover after the activation of hydrogen chloride, which enables the reaction to proceed through Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier of acetylene hydrochlorination compared to the traditional Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood pathway. As a result, the enhanced reaction kinetics further restrict over&#8208;chlorination of single&#8208;atom Ru, thereby ensuring the excellent durability. This work offers a strategy for designing multifunctional catalysts with enhanced performances for acetylene hydrochlorination.</dc:description>

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208; and Quarterpyridine&#8208;Based Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents multipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely defined position and number of pyridinium cationic groups. Specifically, three terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based trialdehydes were synthesized, and utilized as the starting monomers to polymerize with trimethylpyridinium bromide to yield vinylene&#8208;linked iTPy&#8208;COF, iTPPy&#8208;COF and iQPPy&#8208;COF, respectively. Thus constructed donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs exhibit considerably high light&#8208;visible catalytic efficiency for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis by the dual&#8208;channel mechanisms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). In pure water and O2 atmosphere, the H2O2 production rate (HPR) of iTPPy&#8208;COF after 1 h reaction is as high as 7955 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Moreover, it is found that changing the arm lengths and ratios of pyridine to benzene ring in the frameworks significantly affects the photocatalytic capability. The structure&#8208;property relationship is investigated in terms of the variations of electronic structures through the theoretical simulations and measurements of photophysical parameters such as fluorescence lifetimes, photocurrent intensities, and impedances of charge transfer, which presents new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Cluster&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper clusters exhibit superior catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and their defined structures endow them with unique advantages for modelling the catalytic mechanism at the atomic level. Additionally, the construction of highly stable and regularly structured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on copper clusters still presents significant challenges. Herein, we reported two highly stable and reactive cluster&#8208;based COFs (termed Cu4COF&#8208;1 and Cu4COF&#8208;2) constructed via a stepwise assembly strategy. The epitaxially amino&#8208;modified Cu4 cluster (Cu4&#8208;NH2) was initially synthesized based on coordination bonds. Then, Cu4COFs were obtained by the covalent linkage of Cu4&#8208;NH2 clusters and organic linkers. Compared with isolated Cu4 clusters, the Cu4COFs exhibit greater stability, a narrower band gap, a larger specific surface area, and better charge transfer ability, which endow them with superior photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light. In situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the covalently linked Cu4COFs could efficiently lower the energy barrier for the formation of the critical *COOH intermediate, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This study offers a solid basis for the atomically precise construction of novel metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COF catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Connectivity 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with pdp Net for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;connectivity 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention due to their structural complexity, stability, and potential for functional applications. However, the synthesis of 3D COFs using mixed high&#8208;nodal building units remains a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce two novel 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, which are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages (~3.9 nm). Remarkably, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662 exhibit outstanding separation capabilities, achieving adsorption selectivities of 4.3 and 5.9, respectively, for C2H2/CO2 (1/1, v/v) mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm their excellent separation capability, maintaining this performance even under conditions of 100% humidity. Monte Carlo simulations and DFT calculations indicate that the exceptional adsorption performance is attributed to the well&#8208;defined pore cavities of the COFs, with fluorination of the building unit further enhancing C2H2 selectivity through improved electrostatic and host&#8208;guest interactions. This study expands the structural diversity of COFs and highlights their potential for low&#8208;energy separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling Allosteric Modulators of CB1R with an Allosteric Fluoroprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET&#8208;based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB1R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB1R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB1R with comparable affinity (pKi = 5.34 and 5.67, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>A Green and Efficient Recycling Strategy for Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Neutral Solution Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional acid or/and ammonia leaching techniques are usually applied to extract valuable metals during hydrometallurgical recovery of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the excessive and repeated use of acids and bases inevitably increases the environmental burden and safety threats. Herein, considering the advantages of neutral pH solution system in terms of safety and environmental protection, neutral leaching has been pioneeringly proposed to achieve a low&#8208;cost and harmless hydrometallurgical process. Specifically, benefited from the ligand complexation reaction of glycine, the valuable metals can be efficiently leached within neutral environment. More importantly, a strategy of solid&#8208;solid reduction&#160;with primary batteries effect is employed to achieve an efficient neutral leaching within rapid time, breaking through the reaction limitation of shrinking core model. As anticipated, an efficient leaching of 99.99% Li, 96.86% Ni, 92.35% Co, and 90.59% Mn could be achieved within 15 minutes, which has extended applications for various kinds of layered cathodes. Therefore, it is sturdily confirmed that the intractable problem, the effective extraction is available only under the aggressive acid/alkali&#8208;ion conditions, is well&#8208;solved within a wild leaching atmosphere. &#160;This green and efficient strategy in neutral solution environment opens a new pathway to realize the large&#8208;scale pollution&#8208;free recycling of spent batteries.</dc:description>

As anticipated, an efficient leaching of 99.99% Li, 96.86% Ni, 92.35% Co, and 90.59% Mn could be achieved within 15 minutes, which has extended applications for various kinds of layered cathodes. Therefore, it is sturdily confirmed that the intractable problem, the effective extraction is available only under the aggressive acid/alkali-ion conditions, is well-solved within a wild leaching atmosphere. &#160;This green and efficient strategy in neutral solution environment opens a new pathway to realize the large-scale pollution-free recycling of spent batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Chemical Understanding of the O2 Release Process from Nature&#8217;s Water Splitting Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural photosynthesis plays a vital role in the supply of energy and oxygen necessary for the survival of biological organisms. The current leading proposal of the O&#8208;O bond formation in photosystem II suggests the coupling between the central &#956;&#8208;oxo (O5) and the additional oxygenic ligand (Ox) of the manganese&#8208;calcium oxide cofactor. However, the subsequent process through which molecular dioxygen is formed remains elusive. In this report, quantum chemical calculations reveal that the O2 process is initiated by the cleavage of the Mn&#8208;O5 bond, without a preliminary conformational change of the peroxide [O5&#8208;Ox]2&#8208; group. Subsequently, the [O5&#8208;Ox] moiety is converted from the superoxide to the weakly bound quasi&#8208;O2 where the Mn&#8208;Ox bond is cleaved, and after a twist of the quasi&#8208;O2 unit, the free O2 is ultimately released. Alternative pathways display significantly slower kinetics, due to the lower structural stabilities of the rate&#8208;limiting transition states. The cause of the difference is associated with the Jahn&#8208;Teller axial orientation and the local ring strain within the Mn cluster. These findings contribute to unravelling the complex mechanism in an important step of photosynthetic oxygen evolution for a deeper understanding of nature&#8217;s water oxidation catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dominant Face&#8208;On Oriented Perylene&#8208;Diimide Interlayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron transport properties of cathode interlayers are crucial to high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). We propose a novel approach to enhance electron transport of cathode interlayers through controlling a preferential face&#8208;on molecular orientation of non&#8208;ionic perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208; (PDI) based cathode interlayers with restricted n&#8208;doping effects. 1&#8208;(2,5,8&#8208;trioxadec&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole (TOT) units as bulky and extended side chains were incorporated into brominated&#8208;PDIs via click chemistry to yield PDIBr&#8208;TOT. TOT side chains impart PDI&#8208;based interlayers with a dominant face&#8208;on orientation, meanwhile leading to a negligible doping effect due to their weak electron&#8208;donating properties. Impressively, at a slight doping level, higher electron mobility is gained through efficient vertical charge transport channels built by preferred face&#8208;on molecular orientations of PDIBr&#8208;TOT, beating the results acquired through strong doping effects of traditional PDIBr&#8208;N with an edge&#8208;on orientation. Thus, PDIBr&#8208;TOT can suppress exciton recombination and lower the surface energies for good contact with active layers, consequently leading to increases in fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current. Integrating PDIBr&#8208;TOT with various active layers, a remarkable efficiency of 19.52% is obtained. Moreover, device stability is enhanced by restrained doping effects. Modulating face&#8208;on orientations of cathode interlayers prescribed here will encourage further innovative designs of high&#8208;performance cathode interlayers towards OSC advances.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Superior SHG Performance of Ce4+ fluoride Masked by Subtle Ce3+ Impurity and Its Effective Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its unique electronic configuration [Xe]4f0, Ce4+&#8208;compound is a highly desired in the field of advanced nonlinear optical materials, yet its synthesis remains a great challange. Herein, we report a series of cerium fluorides, including a pure Ce4+&#8208;fluoride, high&#8208;performance Na2(Ce4+)F6; three mixed valance state samples, (Mix1&#8211;3, with increasing Ce3+ concentration); and a fully reduced pure Ce3+&#8208;fluoride Na1.5(Ce3+)1.5F6. In particular, Na2(Ce4+)F6, shows an SHG response (4 &#215; KDP), and a wide band gap (4.77 eV), which are the strongest and widest among all Ce&#8208;containing materials to date. With systematic studies, we demonstrate that the subtle Ce3+ impurity significantly reduces performance. By being aware of this fact and consciously controlling experimental conditions, we can ensure the synthesis of pure Na2(Ce4+)F6, which exhibits excellent overall performance and shows great potential for future applications. This work not only reinforced the crucial role of Ce4+ in significantly enhancing the key performance, but also provided invaluable experimental evidence and theoretical support for the future design of more efficient and superior functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Highly Reversible Mn2+/MnO2 Conversion Reaction in Electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries via Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical Process Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the widespread interest in electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with excellent output voltage and high theoretical capacity, the spontaneous disproportionation reaction of free Mn3+ along with the disorderly deposited inactive MnO2 results in the low Mn2+/MnO2 conversion reversibility, which seriously affects their cycling stability. Here, we propose a novel aqueous SiO2 colloidal electrolyte with FeSO4 mediator (denoted as SF electrolyte) based on a bidirectional electrochemical&#8208;chemical model to achieve dual regulation of the MnO2 deposition/dissolution process. During the charging process, the SiO2 colloidal particles located at the carbon felt interface and the electrolyte bulk phase simultaneously provide sufficient disproportionation sites for the diffused Mn3+ to guide the orderly rapid deposition of MnO2. Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe2+ mediators during the discharge process can sufficiently react with MnO2 on the SiO2 particles in the electrolyte, thereby further enabling the efficient conversion of Mn2+/MnO2. Consequently, electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery with SF electrolyte can stably run for 550 cycles at 10 mA h cm&#8208;2 and achieve superior reversibility at a high area capacity of 20 mA h cm&#8208;2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of colloidal electrolytes in modulating electrochemical&#8208;chemical processes to stabilize electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Autocatalysis: Towards a Library of Generally Applicable Reductive Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dichotomous thinking dominates the field of synthetic photochemistry &#8211; either a reaction needs a photocatalyst or not. Herein, we report the identification of a photoredox autocatalytic pathway, an alternative to the existing mechanistic paradigms, to access cyclic biaryl sulfonamides (BASNs). This reaction does not require exogenous catalyst as the visible light absorbing deprotonated product itself, with potent excited state reductive power, acts as the photocatalyst for its own synthesis. This finding implicated BASN as a novel organophotocatalyst architecture and allowed a rapid, modular, and low&#8208;cost combinatorial synthesis of a BASN library that expedited optimal photocatalyst screening. Furthermore, BASN was revealed as a widely applicable organophotocatalyst for diverse transition metal&#8208;free transformations such as: intramolecular (spiro)&#8208;cyclizations, defunctionalizations, and C&#8208;C / C&#8208;heteroatom couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Assisted Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of Unsymmetric Internal Alkynes by Scandium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes is the most straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient method for the synthesis of silylalkenes. However, the hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes often encounters regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity challenges. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes bearing heteroatom functional groups with hydrosilanes by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst. This protocol offers an atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S or N)&#8208;functionalized multisubstituted silylalkenes from a variety of internal homopropargyl thioethers, ethers and tertiary amines and hydrosilanes, featuring 100% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and excellent regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;19:1 r.r. and &gt;19:1 syn/anti). The mechanistic details have been elucidated by control experiments and isolation and examination of some key reaction intermediates. It was revealed that an interaction between the heteroatom (O, S or N) in the internal alkynes and the Sc center was critical for achieving the unprecedented high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols in water&#8212;a &#8242;Holy Grail of DKR&#8242;&#8212;was accomplished using an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) for racemization through a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing sequence and variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) for enantioselective acylation.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is a key method used to prepare optically pure compounds in 100&#8201;% theoretical yield starting from racemic substrates by combining the interconversion of substrate enantiomers with an enantioselective transformation. Various chemoenzymatic DKR approaches have been developed to deracemize secondary alcohols, typically requiring an organic solvent to facilitate enantioselective acylation, primarily catalyzed by lipases, alongside racemization mediated by an achiral, non&#8208;enzymatic catalyst. Achieving both steps in an aqueous solution remained elusive. Herein, we report a DKR of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous solution requiring only two biocatalysts. The first key to success was to achieve fast racemization in a buffer employing a non&#8208;stereoselective variant of an alcohol dehydrogenase (Lk&#8208;ADH&#8208;Prince) via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence. Engineered variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) enabled enantioselective acyl transfer in water. Besides the appropriate choice of the enzymes, identifying a suitable acyl donor was a second key to the success. The DKR was successfully demonstrated using (R)&#8208;selective MsAcT variants for a broad range of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols with 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl acetate as the acyl donor, yielding (R)&#8208;acetates with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conv. and high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent optical purity (83&#8211;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The (S)&#8208;acetates were accessible using a stereocomplementary (S)&#8208;selective MsAcT variant. Notably, substrate concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mM were tolerated in selected cases.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Locking and Sulfur&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Constructing Deep&#8208;Red Organic Electroluminescent Emitter with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on carbon locking and sulfur embedding has been used to construct a high&#8208;performance red multiple resonance (MR) emitter. The fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on the target molecule exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67,0.33) and a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 50.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.







Abstract
The discovery of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with remarkable narrowband emission has opened a new avenue for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, the lack of construction strategies for purely red MR&#8208;TADF materials significantly impedes their application in full&#8208;color high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we propose a unique and handy approach of spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking and sulfur&#8208;embedding strategy to modify the parent MR&#8208;TADF framework, resulting in a red MR&#8208;TADF emitter with high color purity. The reported MR&#8208;TADF molecule (namely, FSBN) demonstrates a pure red emission with an emission maximum of 621&#8197;nm in toluene solution. The OLED with FSBN as emitter exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), which exactly matches the red standard defined by the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC). Importantly, the single&#8208;host OLED achieves a high power efficiency (PE) of up to 50.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, suggesting the potential for the development of low power consumption red OLEDs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208;boration of allenes has been achieved. Moreover, this unusual selectivity is not only limited to &#945;&#8208;boration, but also generally applicable to the unprecedented &#945;&#8208;alkynylation and the rarely explored &#945;&#8208;silylation of allenes.







Abstract
Hydroboration of allenes is powerful and atom&#8208;economic approach to the synthesis of organoboranes, such as the highly versatile allylboranes. However, regarding regiocontrol, existing methods uniformly deliver the boron functionality to the less hindered &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;position, but not the &#945;&#8208;position. The latter is particularly challenging for allenes with substantial steric difference between the two terminals and lacking electronic bias (e.g., 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes). Herein we report the first highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of allenes featuring exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, providing access to sterically hindered allyl boranes that are limitedly accessible by conventional methods. DFT studies suggested that the unusual &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity is attributed to the disfavored reductive elimination at the &#947;&#8208;position due to the high energy cost required to overcome the agostic interaction and rotation of the key &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates. This protocol is also applicable to the previously unprecedented &#945;&#8208;hydroalkynylation and underdeveloped &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of allenes, thus complementing known catalytic systems and providing convenient access to highly congested yet densely&#8208;functionalized allyl silanes and skipped enynes bearing a fully&#8208;substituted allylic carbon center. It is expected that this ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed system can serve as a new platform for the development of other hydrofunctionalization processes with unorthodox selectivity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Skeletal Editing through a Formal Nitrogen Insertion into Indoles to Synthesize Atropisomeric Aminoaryl Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) relay catalyzed enantioselective skeletal editing of indoles with 1,2&#8208;aminoarenes to quinoxaline ring has been developed to prepare various axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines could be converted into various axially chiral building blocks and aminoaryl quinoxaline derived ligand is demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Skeletal editing represents an attractive strategy for adding complexity to a given molecular scaffold in chemical synthesis. Isodesmic reactions provide a complementary skeletal editing approach for the redistribution of chemical bonds in chemical synthesis. However, catalytic enantioselective isodesmic reaction is extremely scarce and enantioselective isodesmic reaction to synthesize atropisomeric compounds is unknown. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization and sequential chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;N bond formation and cleavage from indoles and 1,2&#8208;diaminoarenes under mild reaction conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole scaffold was broken and a novel quinoxaline skeleton was constructed. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Notably, this novel type of quinoxaline atropisomers has promising applications in developing axially chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis. This strategy represents the first example of CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic reaction to form axially chiral compounds.

         <title>Digital and Tunable Genetically Encoded Tension Sensors Based on Engineered Coiled&#8208;Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we create a genetically&#8208;encoded force probe by engineering a coiled&#8208;coil domain flanked by fluorescent proteins that undergo FRET. These probes are fully tunable and calibrated by modeling and single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy and allow one to measure forces within living systems.







Abstract
Genetically encoded tension sensors (GETSs) allow for quantifying forces experienced by intracellular proteins involved in mechanotransduction. The vast majority of GETSs are comprised of a FRET pair flanking an elastic &#8220;spring&#8208;like&#8221; domain that gradually extends in response to force. Because of ensemble averaging, the FRET signal generated by such analog sensors conceals forces that deviate from the average, and hence it is unknown if a subset of proteins experience greater magnitudes of force. We address this problem by developing digital GETSs comprised of coiled&#8208;coils (CCs) with tunable mechanical thresholds. We validate the mechanical response of CC digital probes using thermodynamic stability prediction, AlphaFold2 modeling, steered molecular dynamics simulations, and single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy. Live cell measurements using optimized CC tension sensors that are inserted into vinculin demonstrate that 13&#8201;% of this mechanosensor experiences forces &gt;9.9&#8197;pN within focal adhesions. This reveals greater magnitudes of vinculin force than had previously been reported and demonstrates that CC tension sensors enable more facile and precise tension measurements in living systems.

         <title>Interdependence of Support Wettability &#8208; Electrodeposition Rate&#8208; Sodium Metal Anode and SEI Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines how current collector chemistry and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography, grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and cryogenic focused ion beam microscopy reveal differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation. Mesoscale modeling delineates the role of SEI on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.







Abstract
This study examines how current collector support chemistry (sodiophilic intermetallic Na2Te vs. sodiophobic baseline Cu) and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Capacity and current (6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8211;3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) representative of commercially relevant mass loading in anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AF&#8208;SMBs) are analyzed. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography and grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) are combined with cryogenic ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) microscopy. Highlighted are major differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation e.g. (110) vs. (100) and (211) with support and deposition rate. Within the SEI, sodium fluoride (NaF) is more prevalent with Te&#8722;Cu versus sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with baseline Cu. Due to competitive grain growth the preferred orientation of sodium crystallites depends on film thickness. Mesoscale modeling delineates the role of SEI (ionic conductivity, morphology) on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.

         <title>Supramolecular Spring&#8208;Like Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes Experiencing Giant and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion Across Two Distinct Temperature Regimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique supramolecular spring&#8208;like Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex has been reported, showcasing multiple dynamic factors, including SCO events, ring rotation, and flexible Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au distances. This synergy results in various switchings in magnetism and structure, along with a remarkable &#8220;breathing&#8221; thermal expansion feature across two temperature regions, highlighting its potential as a multifunctional dynamic material for future devices.







Abstract
Dynamic molecules with tunable chemical and physical properties in response to external stimuli hold great potential for applications in various fields such as information storage, smart molecular machines, and biomimetics. Among them, supramolecular springs and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes can both undergo visible macroscopic changes under heat or light stimulation. In this study, we synthesized a unique trinuclear Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex, [(R&#8722;L)FeII{Au(CN)2}2] (R&#8201;1), using a chiral chelating ligand decorated with rotatable benzyl rings. The [FeAu2] trinuclear molecules form a 21&#8208;helical supramolecular chain via elastic Au

&#8943;

Au distance) endows the complex with multiple switchings in both magnetism and structure, as well as the most intriguing characteristic of giant and anisotropic &#8220;breathing&#8221; feature in thermal expansion within two distinct temperature regimes. Specifically, complex R&#8201;1 undergoes two hysteretic magnetic transitions: a non&#8208;spin transition between 360 and 380&#8197;K and an unsymmetric SCO transition in the region of 160&#8211;280&#8197;K, associated with a symmetry&#8208;breaking event between the non&#8208;polar and polar space groups (P212121&#8596;P21). Both transitions are triggered/accompanied by the rotation (inward vs. outward) of the benzyl rings. Correspondingly, reversible spring&#8208;like motions of the helical chains with the helical pitches varying from 11.345140&#8197;K to 12.509280&#8197;K then back to 11.630380&#8197;K&#8197;&#197; are observed in the two distinct temperature regimes. This work demonstrates a significant success in incorporating both SCO and spring&#8208;like motion in one system, paving the way for designing multifunctional dynamic materials for future devices.

         <title>Multivariate Approaches Boosting Lithium&#8208;Mediated Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Different Electrolytes</title>

A first application of chemometric methods in the field of electrochemical ammonia synthesis: this work explores new salts and electrolyte formulations, studied in a reactor operating under mild conditions and able to provide &#8776;40&#8201;% efficiencies of molecular nitrogen conversion into ammonia.







Abstract
Ammonia electrosynthesis through the lithium&#8208;mediated approach has recently reached promising results towards high activity and selectivity in aprotic media, reaching high Faradaic efficiency (FE) values and NH3 production rates. To fasten the comprehension and optimization of the complex lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction system, for the first time a multivariate approach is proposed as a powerful tool to reduce the number of experiments in comparison with the classical one&#8208;factor&#8208;at&#8208;a&#8208;time approach. Doehlert design and surface response methodology are employed to optimize the electrolyte composition for a batch autoclaved cell. The method is validated with the common LiBF4 salt, and the correlations between the FE and the amount of lithium salt and ethanol as proton donor are elucidated, also discussing their impact on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Moreover, a new fluorinated salt is proposed (i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalate) borate (LiFOB)), taking inspiration from lithium batteries. This salt is chosen to tailor the SEI layer, with the aim of obtaining a bifunctional interfacial layer, both stable and permeable to N2, the latter being an essential characteristic for batch systems. The SEI layer composition is confirmed strategic and its tailoring with LiFOB boosts FE values.

         <title>From Natural Product Derivative to Hexagonal Prism Supermolecule: Potent Biofilm Disintegration, Enhanced Foliar Affinity, and Effective Management of Tomato Bacterial Canker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

A bioactive benzothiazole&#8208;modified glycyrrhetinic acid (BPGA) and cucurbit[7,8]uril (CB[7,8]) undergo self&#8208;assembly, culminating in the fabrication of a multifunctional hexagonal prism supramolecular bactericidal material, BPGA@CB[8]. This smart supramolecular assembly effectively disorganizes Clavibacter michiganensis (Cmm) biofilms and enhances foliar affinity, thereby enabling a highly effective management strategy for tomato bacterial canker.







Abstract
Clavibacter michiganensis (Cmm), designated as an A2 quarantine pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), incites bacterial canker of tomato, which presently eludes rapid and effective control methodologies. Dense biofilms formed by Cmm shield internal bacteria from host immune defenses and obstruct the ingress of agrochemicals. Even when agrochemicals disintegrate biofilms, splashing and bouncing during application disperse active ingredients away from target sites. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate a hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped material, BPGA@CB[8], assembled from an 18&#946;&#8208;glycyrrhetinic acid derivative (PBGA) and host molecule&#8212;cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) via host&#8211;guest recognition. This positively charged material manifests multifaceted functionalities, notably the ability to surmount biofilm barriers, annihilate the encased pathogenic bacteria, and enhance foliar affinity of droplets. The strong in vitro potency and effective deposition of BPGA@CB[8] foster optimal conditions for robust in vivo efficacy, demonstrating superior protective and curative activities (56.9&#8201;%/53.4&#8201;%) against canker of tomato at a low&#8208;dose of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8901;mL&#8722;1 compared to BPGA (44.6&#8201;%/42.2&#8201;%), kasugamycin (30.1&#8201;%/28.4&#8201;%), and thiodiazole copper (35.4&#8201;%/31.0&#8201;%). This supramolecular material, based on natural product derivatives, provides a potent treatment for high&#8208;risk canker of tomato, and exemplifies the utility of supramolecular strategies in optimizing the attributes of natural products for managing plant bacterial diseases.

         <title>Deciphering and Enhancing Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Sodium Deposition towards Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Sodium Metal Batteries</title>

The DOL&#8208;based electrolyte, with dominant SSIP and CIP structures, achieves 1.78&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 Na+ conductivity and strong low&#8208;temperature kinetics. Kinetic analysis identifies cation transport as the key factor in battery operation. High&#8208;loading full cells cycled stably for 600&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;cycles at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C, showing promise for high&#8208;voltage sodium batteries in extreme conditions.







Abstract
Achieving high ionic conductivity and stable performance at low temperatures remains a significant challenge in sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs). In this study, we propose a novel electrolyte design strategy that elucidates the solvation structure&#8208;function relationship within mixed solvent systems. A mixture of diglyme and 1,3&#8208;dioxolane was developed to optimize the solvation structure towards superior low&#8208;temperature electrolyte. Molecular dynamics simulations and Raman spectra results reveal the solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs and contact ion pairs dominated solvation structure in the designed electrolyte, displaying a superior ionic conductivity of 1.78&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Besides, comprehensive kinetic analysis shows Na+ transportation in the electrolyte shows a greater impact on sodium plating than Na+ transport through the solid electrolyte interphase or charge transfer. As a result, the electrolyte enables stable operation for over 12,000&#8197;hours in Na

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Electrochemical CO2 Methanation via the Alloying of Single Cobalt Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

We developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a methane (CH4) Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60&#8201;% with a partial current density of &#8722;482.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8722;C coupling or CO desorption pathways.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity&#8208;activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60&#8201;% with a partial current density of &#8722;482.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8722;C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion technologies.

         <title>Air&#8208;Mediated Biomimetic Synthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoate with C4 Diol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a strategy that utilizes a ruthenium&#8208;phosphorus synergistic catalytic system, mimicking enzyme&#8208;coenzyme functionality, to efficiently catalyze the air&#8208;mediated oxidation of the C4 diol, 1,4&#8208;butanediol, to produce the intermediate monomer &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone. This monomer is then used in ring&#8208;opening polymerization to synthesize high molecular weight polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) products extracellularly.







Abstract
Poly(4&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P4HB) is a high&#8208;performance, well&#8208;recyclable, and biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). However, conventional bioproduction of homopolymeric P4HB involves complex and costly processes with C4 feedstocks, particularly 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO), and enzyme&#8208;coenzyme systems in genetically engineered bacteria. An alternative extracellular chemical route utilizing aerial oxidation of BDO offers cost and energy benefits but struggle with conversion efficiency. Inspired by efficient intracellular oxidation of primary alcohols, we propose a ruthenium&#8208;phosphine synergistic catalytic system that mimics enzyme&#8208;coenzyme functionality. This system effectively catalyzed the air&#8208;mediated, solvent&#8208;free oxidation of BDO to produce &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#947;&#8208;BL) and oligomeric P4HB, with a space&#8208;time yield (10.37&#8197;g [&#947;&#8208;BL unit] g&#8722;1 catalyst h&#8722;1) surpassing the values (&lt;5.5) of previous approaches. The oligomer&#8208;containing products were reversibly converted to &#947;&#8208;BL and then to P4HB (28.9&#8197;kDa) via ring&#8208;opening polymerization, exceeding reported values (&lt;16&#8197;kDa). This study provides the potential for large&#8208;scale synthesis of high&#8208;value PHAs from diverse non&#8208;grain&#8208;based diols, offering economic and environmental advantages.

&lt;p&gt;We reported a strategy that utilizes a ruthenium-phosphorus synergistic catalytic system, mimicking enzyme-coenzyme functionality, to efficiently catalyze the air-mediated oxidation of the C4 diol, 1,4-butanediol, to produce the intermediate monomer &#947;-butyrolactone. This monomer is then used in ring-opening polymerization to synthesize high molecular weight polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) products extracellularly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) (P4HB) is a high-performance, well-recyclable, and biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). However, conventional bioproduction of homopolymeric P4HB involves complex and costly processes with C4 feedstocks, particularly 1,4-butanediol (BDO), and enzyme-coenzyme systems in genetically engineered bacteria. An alternative extracellular chemical route utilizing aerial oxidation of BDO offers cost and energy benefits but struggle with conversion efficiency. Inspired by efficient intracellular oxidation of primary alcohols, we propose a ruthenium-phosphine synergistic catalytic system that mimics enzyme-coenzyme functionality. This system effectively catalyzed the air-mediated, solvent-free oxidation of BDO to produce &#947;-butyrolactone (&#947;-BL) and oligomeric P4HB, with a space-time yield (10.37&#8197;g [&#947;-BL unit] g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) surpassing the values (&amp;lt;5.5) of previous approaches. The oligomer-containing products were reversibly converted to &#947;-BL and then to P4HB (28.9&#8197;kDa) via ring-opening polymerization, exceeding reported values (&amp;lt;16&#8197;kDa). This study provides the potential for large-scale synthesis of high-value PHAs from diverse non-grain-based diols, offering economic and environmental advantages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orthorhombic Covalent Organic Frameworks with fmj Topology as Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first construction of orthorhombic three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with fmj topology has been realized on the basis of rotatable monomers. Significant isomeric effects on protonation, optoelectronic properties, and photocatalytic activity have been revealed for 3D COFs and a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate has been achieved.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), a class of highly porous crystalline polymers, have exhibited great potentials in many applications. However, the reported topologies of 3D COFs have been limited to high&#8208;symmetry crystal systems, which significantly hindered the development of such functional materials. Herein, we demonstrate the first construction of four highly crystalline orthorhombic 3D COFs with an unprecedented fmj topology, based on judiciously choosing rotatable monomers. Notably, the square monomers in the unit cell of the fmj topological network adopt three different conformations, resulting in a highly complicated 3D network. Moreover, an isomeric pair (3DCOF&#8208;CN and 3DCOF&#8208;NC), differing only in the orientations of &#8722;C=N&#8208;bonds, exhibit distinct optoelectronic properties, protonation abilities, and photocatalytic activities, which is the first time to reveal such isomeric effects in 3D COFs. Particularly, a difference of 32&#8208;fold in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate was observed for the two isomers, with one achieving a superb rate up to ~31.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work achieves the first construction of complex orthorhombic 3D COFs, and offers new insights for the development of 3D COF&#8208;based high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Divergent Activity Shifts of Tin&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: pH&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Single&#8208;Atom Versus Polyatomic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal an exciting contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn displays opposite behaviors. This response results in a fascinating, opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Most importantly, we propose that distinct strategies are necessary for designing catalysts using single&#8208;atom versus polyatomic metal catalysts.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single&#8208;atom Sn (e.g., Sn&#8722;N&#8722;C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH&#8208;dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large&#8208;scale data mining (with &gt;2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH&#8208;field coupled modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Single Selenium Site for Selective Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural process of glutathione peroxidase in scavenging peroxides, we designed a single selenium site&#8208;modified carbon moiety, which shows a nearly&#8208;100&#8201;% 4&#8208;electron selectivity and significantly increased consecutive 2+2 electron selectivity in oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Learning from nature has garnered significant attention in the scientific community for its potential to inspire creative solutions in material or catalyst design. The study highlights the design of a biomimetic single selenium (Se) site&#8208;modified carbon (C) moiety that retains the unique reactivity of selenoenzyme with peroxides, which plays crucial roles in selectively catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The as&#8208;designed Se&#8722;C demonstrates nearly 100&#8201;% 4&#8208;electron selectivity, evidenced by 0.039&#8201;% of H2O2 yield at 0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming commercial platinum (Pt) by 65 times. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations attribute this exceptional selectivity to the enzyme&#8208;like behaviors of the Se site to steal an O atom from peroxide intermediates. The second achievement is the significantly increased consecutive 2+2 electron selectivity. Benefiting from the enzyme&#8208;like H2O2 reduction activity with a higher onset potential of 0.915&#8197;V compared to Pt at 0.875&#8197;V, the Se&#8722;C as a secondary catalytic site reduced the H2O2 yields of the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C, Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, and N&#8722;C catalysts by 96&#8201;%, 67&#8201;%, and 98&#8201;%, respectively, via a consecutive 2+2 electron pathway. This also leads to more stable catalysts via protecting the active sites from oxidative attacks. This work establishes new pathways for precise tuning of reaction selectivity in ORR and beyond.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Valent Copper Catalysis Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Difunctionalization of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, stable, and reusable Cu(0) catalyst for the difunctionalization of alkynes using different electrophiles and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as chemical feedstocks to afford di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinylboronate ester derivatives under mild reaction conditions with excellent regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity has been developed.







Abstract
The development of a metallic copper&#8208;based catalyst system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly stable, active, and reusable Cu0 catalyst for the carboboration of alkynes using carbon electrophiles and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as chemical feedstocks to afford di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinylboronate esters in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner with appreciable turnover number (TON) of up to 2535 under mild reaction conditions. This three&#8208;component coupling reaction works well with a variety of substituted electrophiles and alkynes with broad functional group tolerance. In addition, a wide range of terminal and challenging internal alkynes were efficiently converted into hydroborated products in up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield with excellent regioselectivity in the absence of carbon electrophiles. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis confirm that the oxidation state of the copper in the catalyst is zero. The broad range of organic transformations, effectiveness, and recyclability of this Cu0 catalyst are the major achievements that provide an environmentally friendly route for the efficient production of tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins, key intermediates in organic synthesis. The gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthetic transformations further highlights the usefulness of these methods.

&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient, stable, and reusable Cu(0) catalyst for the difunctionalization of alkynes using different electrophiles and &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(pinacolato)diboron (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as chemical feedstocks to afford di- and trisubstituted vinylboronate ester derivatives under mild reaction conditions with excellent regio-, chemo-, and stereo-selectivity has been developed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a metallic copper-based catalyst system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly stable, active, and reusable Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst for the carboboration of alkynes using carbon electrophiles and &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(pinacolato)diboron (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as chemical feedstocks to afford di- and trisubstituted vinylboronate esters in a regio- and stereoselective manner with appreciable turnover number (TON) of up to 2535 under mild reaction conditions. This three-component coupling reaction works well with a variety of substituted electrophiles and alkynes with broad functional group tolerance. In addition, a wide range of terminal and challenging internal alkynes were efficiently converted into hydroborated products in up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% yield with excellent regioselectivity in the absence of carbon electrophiles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis confirm that the oxidation state of the copper in the catalyst is zero. The broad range of organic transformations, effectiveness, and recyclability of this Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst are the major achievements that provide an environmentally friendly route for the efficient production of tri- and tetrasubstituted olefins, key intermediates in organic synthesis. The gram-scale reaction and synthetic transformations further highlights the usefulness of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Spiropyran Coacervates as Dual&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Switchable Reactive Oxygen Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

Photochemical reactions of the spiropyran coacervates in aqueous solution, in cells, and in animals enable dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;switchable ROS generation and cancer treatment.







Abstract
Low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds of certain structural features may form coacervates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates can enter mammalian cells and affect cellular physiology. Controlling the properties of the coacervates inside cells, however, is a challenge. Here, we report photochemical reactions of spiropyran (SP)&#8208;based coacervates with two wavelengths of light, in vitro, in the cell, and in animals, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photo&#8208;controlled cell killing. We identify an SP&#8208;containing compound, SP&#8208;PEG8&#8208;SP, that forms coacervates (SP&#8208;C) in the aqueous solution. Photo illumination by a UV light triggers the isomerization of SP to merocyanine (MC), switching SP&#8208;C to the fluorescent coacervates MC&#8208;C. A visible light converts MC&#8208;C back to SP&#8208;C and induces ROS generation. Notably, coacervate formation increases the compound's ROS generation efficiency. The SP&#8208;C/MC&#8208;C coacervate system (collectively called spiropyran coacervates) can spontaneously enter cells, and a dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;controlled reversible on/off switch and spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved ROS production is realized within the cytoplasm. Light&#8208;induced ROS generation leads to cytotoxicity to cancer cells, tumor organoids, and tumors in vivo, supporting spiropyran coacervates&#8217; potential use as coacervate photosensitizers in photodynamic therapies.

         <title>Defluorinative C&#8722;O Coupling between Trifluoromethylarenes and Alcohols via Copper Photoredox Catalysis</title>

CF2O&#8208;compounds are prepared via photoinduced, Cu&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative coupling between readily available trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. A molecule displaying liquid crystal property was synthesized through this convergent and step&#8208;economical method. Mechanistic studies suggested that a homoleptic Cu&#8208;bisphosphine complex serves as the photocatalyst, and the two salt additives are crucial in orchestrating this dual&#8208;cycle system.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds have shown unparalleled impacts in the realm of functional molecules, and the ability to prepare novel structures has been crucial in unlocking new properties for applications in pharmaceutical and materials science. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced defluorinative C&#8722;O coupling between trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. This method allows for direct access to a wide selection of difluorobenzylether (ArCF2OR) molecules, including a compound displaying liquid crystal behavior. Through slight modification of the protocol, we were able to generate difluorobenzyliodide (ArCF2I) products, another class of synthetically useful fluorine&#8208;bearing molecules. Mechanistic investigations first suggested that ArCF2I can serve as a reservoir to steadily supply the key ArCF2&#8901; radical species. Furthermore, experimental evidence supported a mechanism consisting of two collaborative cycles: C&#8722;F activation operated by a homoleptic Cu(I) coordinated by two bisphosphine ligands as the photocatalyst and C&#8722;O coupling promoted by a Cu(I) ligated by a single bisphosphine ligand. The critical roles of the two salt additives, lithium iodide and zinc acetate, in orchestrating the two cycles were also elucidated. This dual&#8208;role copper catalyst demonstrates the power of base metal photoredox catalysis in achieving both substrate activation and chemical bond formation via a single catalytic system.

         <title>Probing the Protein Kinases&#8242; Cysteinome by Covalent Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite extensive research on covalent kinase inhibitors, much of the protein kinases&#8217; &#8220;cysteinome&#8221; remains unexplored. Here, we outline a generalizable approach to sample ATP&#8208;site cysteines with fragment&#8208;like covalent inhibitors. Thereby, we significantly expand the repertoire of targetable cysteines in the kinome, provide insights into unique binding modes and present valuable hits for the development of covalent chemical probes and drugs.







Abstract
Protein kinases are important drug targets, yet specific inhibitors have been developed for only a fraction of the more than 500 human kinases. A major challenge in designing inhibitors for highly related kinases is selectivity. Unlike their non&#8208;covalent counterparts, covalent inhibitors offer the advantage of selectively targeting structurally similar kinases by modifying specific protein side chains, particularly non&#8208;conserved cysteines. Previously, covalent fragment screens yielded potent and selective inhibitors for individual kinases such as ERK1/2 but have not been applied to the broader kinome. Furthermore, many of the accessible cysteine positions have not been addressed so far. Here, we outline a generalizable approach to sample ATP&#8208;site cysteines with fragment&#8208;like covalent inhibitors. We present the development of a kinase&#8208;focused covalent fragment library and its systematic screening against a curated selection of 47 kinases, with 60 active site&#8208;proximal cysteines using LC/MS and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays, followed by hit validation through various complementary techniques. Our findings expand the repertoire of targetable cysteines within protein kinases, provide insight into unique binding modes identified from crystal structures and deliver isoform&#8208;specific hits with promising profiles as starting points for the development of highly potent and selective covalent inhibitors.

         <title>Deciphering pH Mismatching at the Electrified Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface towards Understanding Intrinsic Water Molecule Oxidation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating operando electrochemical methods with (micro)kinetic modelling, the dynamic local pH effect for the oxygen evolution reaction is clarified. An unconventional reversible hydrogen reference electrode is employed, enabling a clearer interpretation of intrinsic electrochemical kinetics. This approach offers deeper insights into the microscopic electrode processes in the electrified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with dynamic local pH.







Abstract
Unveiling the key influencing factors towards electrode/electrolyte interface control is a long&#8208;standing challenge for a better understanding of microscopic electrode kinetics, which is indispensable to building up guiding principles for designer electrocatalysts with desirable functionality. Herein, we exemplify the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water molecule oxidation with the iridium dioxide electrocatalyst and uncovered the significant mismatching effect of pH between local electrode surface and bulk electrolyte: the intrinsic OER activity under acidic or near&#8208;neutral condition was deciphered to be identical by adjusting this pH mismatching. This result indicates that the local pH effect at the electrified solid&#8211;liquid interface plays the main role in the &#8220;fake&#8221; OER performance. This local pH effect on the OER electrode process is further verified by integrating a wide spectrum of analytical approaches. This study will accelerate the understanding of the local proton&#8208;induced effect on electrode interface processes and the development of advanced electrochemical activity.

         <title>Generating Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Self&#8208;assembled Films of Chiral Selenium Nanoparticles and Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films have been successfully developed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity under laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm. By controlling the assembly sequence and layer number, the chiral film exhibited strong circular dichroism (CD) signals and CPL activity, with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.68.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has garnered significant research attention. Achieving a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) is a key challenge in this field. Herein, we reported, for the first time, the fabrication of a chiral assembled film consisting of chiral D&#8208;/L&#8208;Selenium nanoparticles (D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se NPs) and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;NH2 modified upconversion nanoparticles (DPNUCNPs) with remarkable CPL properties that were generated by the interfacial self&#8208;assembly technique. The chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films, consisting of three layers (3L) of D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se films and 3L DPNUCNPs films, exhibited the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and the strongest CPL signals. Under laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm, the 3L D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se/3L DPNUCNPs assembled films displayed symmetric CPL signals between 400 and 600&#8197;nm, with a maximum |glum| value of 0.68. The interaction between DPNUCNPs and Se NPs involves energy transfer and chirality transfer, along with the formation of spin&#8208;polarized excitons, thereby resulting in CPL activity. Furthermore, the chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films were patterned for anti&#8208;counterfeit and encryption applications. Our study provides a novel guide for fabricating chiral nanomaterials with strong CPL response.

         <title>Formally Zerovalent Bis(arene) Germylene Complexes of Zirconium and Hafnium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(arene) coordination compounds of zirconium and hafnium have been synthesized in high yield by 4e reduction of tetrachloride adducts with a germylene phosphine Lewis pair. A puckered coordination mode of an arene moiety is discussed based on structural and spectroscopic data. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized. Dimethylbutadiene reacts under formation of a cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand. This addition is reversible at room temperature in the zirconium case.







Abstract
Tetrachlorides of zirconium and hafnium form adducts&#8197;(2, 3) with an intramolecular germylene phosphine Lewis pair. Two electron reduction treating the adducts with [MesNacnacMg]2 gives the low&#8208;valent metal complexes&#8197;(4, 5) featuring &#951;6&#8208;Trip coordination at the Zr(II) and Hf(II) metal atom. Reduction of the M(II)&#8208;complexes gives the zerovalent metal complexes of zirconium&#8197;(6) and hafnium&#8197;(7), which have been structurally characterized. Two arene moieties and the germylene exhibit metal coordination. Puckered coordination of a P&#8208;phenyl unit was observed for both derivatives&#8197;6 and 7. Four electron reduction of a reaction mixture of metal tetrachloride with the germylene phosphine Lewis pair also gives the zerovalent complexes in good yield. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized treating the reduced metal complexes with carbon monoxide. Dimethylbutadiene shows a reaction with an arene moiety and the coordinated germylene ligand of the zerovalent complexes. A cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand are formed. For zirconium this reaction is reversible at room temperature.

         <title>2H NMR as a Practical Tool for Following MOF Formation: A Case Study of UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article investigates UiO&#8208;66 synthesis over time using deuterium NMR, focusing on three modulators: acetic acid, benzoic acid, and hydrochloric acid. It reveals that slow linker incorporation results in the fastest and most defect&#8208;free MOF formation due to an acid&#8208;assisted dissociative mechanism. Deuterium NMR was crucial, enabling separate probing of components without altering the synthetic protocol.







Abstract
Developing the mechanism for MOF formation is crucial for the rapid development of new materials. This work demonstrates that Deuterium&#8197;NMR spectroscopy is the optimal inter&#8208;laboratory methodology for understanding the in situ kinetics of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) formation. This method is facile, affordable, and allows for the isolation and monitoring of individual reagents by using one deuterated component while the remaining components are protonated. This study utilizes 2H&#8197;NMR, via the spectrometer's lock channel, to investigate the formation of UiO&#8208;66 as influenced by different modulators: acetic acid, benzoic acid, and hydrochloric acid. By monitoring the concentration of the deuterated linker and observing the chemical shift and peak width of deuterated water over time, key elements of the mechanism are unraveled. Paradoxically, conditions that cause the ligand to be consumed more slowly result in MOFs forming more quickly and with fewer defects. This phenomenon is attributed to the dissociative mechanism associated with the Zr(IV)&#8208;containing node.

         <title>Distinctive Photomechanical Shape Change of p&#8208;Phenylenediacrylic Acid Dimethyl Ester Single Crystals Induced by a Spatially Heterogeneous Photoreaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester in single crystals were examined, revealing a reaction front propagation from the edge to the center. As the photoreaction progresses, the crystal undergoes a distinctive shape transformation, changing from a parallelogram to a distorted &#8220;fluttering flag&#8221; shape and eventually becoming a rectangle. Density functional theory calculations predict the post&#8208;reaction crystal structure, explaining this unique shape change through the spatially heterogeneous nature of the photoreaction.







Abstract
Understanding photoreaction dynamics in crystals is important for predicting the dynamic property changes accompanying these photoreactions. In this work, we investigate the photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester (p&#8208;PDAMe) in single crystals that show reaction front propagation, in which the photoreaction proceeds heterogeneously from the edge to the center of the crystal. Moreover, we find that p&#8208;PDAMe single crystals exhibit a distinctive crystal shape change from a parallelogram to a distorted shape resembling a fluttering flag, then to a rectangle as the photoreaction proceeds. Density functional theory calculations predict the crystal structure after the photoreaction, providing a reasonable explanation of the distinctive crystal shape change that results from the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction. These results prove that the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction dynamics have the ability to induce novel crystal shape changes beyond what would be expected based on the equilibrium reactant and product crystal shapes.

         <title>Unexpected Magnetic Moments in Manganese&#8208;Doped (CdSe)13 Nanoclusters: Role of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped (CdSe)13 nanoclusters synthesized with Se&#8208;NaBH4 and Se&#8208;urea exhibit distinct magnetic and photoluminescent properties. Se&#8208;NaBH4&#8208;derived nanoclusters demonstrate superior Mn2+ doping efficiency (12.3&#8201;%) compared to Se&#8208;urea&#8208;derived clusters, leading to exceptional magnetic moments (40&#8197;&#956;B at 180&#8197;K) and pronounced spin fluctuations.

This study explores the enhancement&#160;in magnetic and photoluminescence properties of Mn2+&#8208;doped (CdSe)13 nanoclusters, significantly influenced by the introduction of paramagnetic centers through doping, facilitated by optimized precursor chemistry and precisely controlled surface ligand interactions. Using a cost&#8208;effective and scalable synthesis approach with elemental Se and NaBH4 (Se&#8208;NaBH4) in n&#8208;octylamine, we tailored bonding configurations (Cd&#8722;O, Cd&#8722;N, and Cd&#8722;Se) on the surface of nanoclusters, as confirmed by EXAFS analysis. These bonding configurations allowed for tunable Mn2+&#8208;doping with tetrahedral coordination, further stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetate ligands, as evidenced by 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy. Mulliken charge analysis indicates that the charge redistribution on Se2&#8722; suggests electron transfer between surface ligands and the nanocluster, contributing to spin fluctuations. These tailored configurations markedly increased the nanoclusters&#8242; magnetic susceptibility and photoluminescence efficiency. The resulting nanoclusters demonstrated a clear concentration&#8208;dependent response in emission lifetimes and intensities upon exposure to magnetic field effects (MFE) and spin&#8208;spin coupling, alongside a large magnetic moment exceeding 40 &#956;B at 180&#8197;K. These findings highlight the potential of these nanoclusters for magneto&#8208;optical devices and spintronic applications, showcasing their tunable magnetic properties and exciton dynamics.

Bridged Carbolong Modulating for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells: A bridged carbolong modulating strategy to regulate the perovskite/C60 to accelerate interfacial electron transfer, reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration. The photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stable devices reached 25.80% of efficiency and maintained 98% of its initial efficiency over 1400 h of illumination, and the efficiency of modules achieved 20.72% (25.25 cm2 active area) with robust operational stability.







Abstract
Efficient regulation of perovskite/C60 interface is crucial to improving the long&#8208;term stability of the inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, precise methods for controlling the perovskite/C60 interface have yet to be thoroughly explored. Herein, we develop a carbolong chemical manipulation strategy to improve the interface contact of perovskite/C60 due to versatile functional groups and excellent optoelectronic properties of carbolong metallaaromatics. And constructing an electron&#8208;transfer bridge enhances the interfacial interaction and accelerates interfacial electron transfer. The carbolong manipulation results in optimized energy level alignment, suppressed nonradiative recombination, and improved electronic contact. An impressive efficiency of 25.80% is demonstrated, with open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor of 1.19&#8201;V and 84.53&#8201;%, respectively. The unsealed devices retain more than 98&#8201;% of their original efficiency after 1400&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking under illumination and demonstrate remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 93&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2500&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. And the encapsulated carbolong&#8208;modified module achieved a high efficiency of 20.72&#8201;% (active area of 25.25 cm2) with robust operation stability.

         <title>Highly Efficient Chiral Separation Based on Alkali&#8208;proof Protein Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

Basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based chiral stationary phases that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. Upon incorporating CSPs into chiral separation columns, we enable high&#8208;precision chiral chromatographic separation with exceptional stability.







Abstract
Chiral separation plays a pivotal role in both practical applications and industrial productions. However, traditional chiral stationary phases (CSPs) exhibit inherent instability in alkaline environments, presenting a significant challenge despite their importance. Herein, basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based CSPs that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. An in&#8208;depth theoretical simulation is conducted to unveil the unique three&#8208;dimensional conformation of alcalase, showing selective affinity towards various enantiomers of chiral amino acids and drugs, especially acidic substrates. Subsequently, an in situ assembly strategy is used to immobilize alcalase within a hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platform. The generated protein&#8208;based CSPs enable successful baseline separation (Rs&#8805;1.50) for various value&#8208;added compounds (e.g., non&#8208;steroidal drug, RS&#8208;flurbiprofen; nucleotide analog, RS&#8208;tenofovir) via high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, surpassing the commercial chiral column. Furthermore, a systematic study reveals that increasing hydrophilicity and pore sizes of COFs can enhance the separation performance. Remarkably, the obtained CSPs demonstrated exceptional durability, maintaining performance for &gt;2,400 runs. This study provides a new member to the protein library for CSPs, and represents an innovative and effective platform for CSPs with immense potential for the enantioseparation of acidic drugs.

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalysis of Molecular&#8208;Like Au8M(PPh3)8n+ Clusters Cultivated in Mesoporous SBA&#8208;15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy for designing the heterogeneous catalyst denoted as TiOx/cluster@SBA, where the three functional units of clusters, SBA&#8208;15 and TiOx are combined into one heterogeneous catalyst, and thereby we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis.







Abstract
It is a dream of researchers to be able to tailor the catalytic performances by adjusting heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level. Atomically precise metal clusters provide us with the possibility to achieve this challenge. Here, we design a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy coupled with TiOx coating to prepare the heterogeneous catalysts denoted as TiOx/Au8M@SBA via cultivating atomically precise Au8M(PPh3)8n+ (M=Pd, Pt or Au; n=2 for Pd/Pt and 3 for Au) clusters in mesoporous molecular sieve. The catalysts are made up of the three functional units, which include Au8M(PPh3)8n+ clusters that can act as the active sites, the pore environment of the SBA&#8208;15 that can announce a catalysis show for the clusters with precise number of atoms maintained during the chemical reactions, and the TiOx coating that can further inhibit the migration of the clusters under reaction conditions. The selective hydrogenation of acetylene performed in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor taken, for example, we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis. This work sheds light on the fundamental insight into catalysis origin of heterogeneous catalysts and achieves a distinguished level of detail for cluster catalysis.

To unify the selectivity and activity of CO electroreduction for C2+ alcohols, a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst was developed to balance the competition between CO reduction and hydrogen evolution on Cu sites. Zn alloying increases CO coverage on Cu and facilitates hydrogen spillover from Zn to Cu, synergistically promoting alcohol formation, achieving a 50&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for alcohol synthesis at a current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, specifically ethanol and n&#8208;propanol through CO electroreduction (CORR) in H2O, presents a sustainable pathway for intermittent renewable energy storage and a low&#8208;carbon economy. However, achieving high selectivity for alcohol production at industrial current densities is kinetically hampered by side reactions such as ethylene generation and hydrogen evolution reaction, which result from competing adsorption of *CO and *H. In this study, we developed a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst to simultaneously enhance the activity and selectivity for alcohol production by increasing CO capture capacity and enriching active hydrogen on Cu sites. Our findings demonstrate that the Cu/5Zn alloy with a molar ratio of Cu to Zn of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 50&#8201;% for the selective electrosynthesis of C2+ alcohols during ampere&#8208;level CO electrolysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the Cu/Zn alloy promotes polarized Cu sites, enhancing CO adsorption while facilitating the spillover of hydrogen atoms from Zn to Cu sites, contributing to selective alcohol formation.

         <title>Polyoxotungstate Featuring Zinc&#8208;Ion&#8208;Triggered Structural Transformation as An Efficient Electrolyte Additive for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a rare instance of a soluble high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate exhibiting Zn2+&#8208;triggered structural transformation from 0D nanocluster to 2D layer in ZnSO4 solution. Further, we showcase that such a kind of polyoxometalate, possessing Zn2+&#8208;triggered structural transformation properties, represents a new&#8208;type and promising class of additives for aqueous zinc battery electrolytes with significant potential applications.







Abstract
It is promising but still challenging for the widespread application of aqueous zinc batteries due to the poor reversibility of the zinc anode caused by prevalent dendrite growth and pronounced interfacial side reactions. Herein, we report a rare soluble and water&#8208;stable high&#8208;nuclearity {Nd9Si4W39} polyoxotungstate. Interestingly, upon encountering Zn2+ ions, the discrete {Nd9Si4W39} nanocluster undergoes a structural transformation to form an infinitely extended cluster&#8208;based {[Zn(H2O)4]3[Nd9Si4W39]2} two&#8208;dimensional honeycomb layer, with which atomic&#8208;level Zn2+ ion effects in reconstructing the layer are determined. More interestingly, we demonstrate that the structural transformation property renders the {Nd9Si4W39} cluster an efficient electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc batteries, enabling the formation of the 2D layer as a protective layer on the zinc anode, significantly enhancing the reversibility of the zinc anode. Compared to the pristine Zn//Zn symmetric battery, the Zn//Zn symmetric battery with the {Nd9Si4W39} additive exhibits an extended lifespan of over 2000&#8197;hours at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of the protective layer effectively promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits zinc agglomeration, dendrite growth, and side reactions, thereby enabling the zinc anode to exhibit high reversibility and long&#8208;term service life.

         <title>General and Fast Gas&#8211;Solid Synthesis of Functional MXenes and Derivatives on the Scale of Tens of Grams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;solid reaction system with high selectivity, controllability and compatibility enables fast etching, doping and transformation of MAX phases and the large&#8208;scale production of MXenes and their derivatives. The as&#8208;obtained samples exhibit excellent capability in effectively reducing the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides via chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion as evidenced by both of theoretical and experimental results.







Abstract
The rising of MXenes not only enriches the two&#8208;dimensional material family but also brings more opportunities for diverse functional applications. However, the controllable synthesis of MXenes is still unsatisfied via the common liquid&#8208;solid etching route, considering the unsolved problems like safety risk, time cost and easy oxidation. Herein, a facile yet efficient gas&#8208;solid (G&#8208;S) reaction methodology is devised by using hydrogen fluoride gas derived from fluorinated organics as the MAX etchant toward high&#8208;efficiency fabrication of multiple MXenes and their derivatives. The innovative G&#8208;S reaction strategy exhibits superb versatility to achieve different gram&#8208;level MXenes (V2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, Ti2N, Ti3CN, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C) in a very short time, and even realizes in situ heteroatom doping or synchronous phase conversion of MXenes directly from MAX phases. The obtained MXenes and their derivatives exhibit excellent structure stability and high electron/ion conductivity, making them promising materials for electrochemical applications. In particular, the N&#8208;doped V2C MXene shows superior adsorption and catalytic activity toward lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Driven by Dichroic Competition of Achiral Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing a dynamically photoresponsive dichroic competition between two achiral dyes within a chiral cholesteric liquid crystal has led to an excitation&#8208;dependent material. Excitation at 365&#8197;nm generates a negative CPL signal (glum=&#8722;0.16) at 650&#8197;nm, while excitation at 430&#8197;nm results in inversion of the CPL signal and an increase in the glum value to +0.26, with the helical superstructure and handedness of the materials remaining unchanged.







Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) materials holds significant potential for achieving three&#8208;dimensional (3D) anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, constructing phototunable CLCs systems with easy fabrication and fast response remains a great challenge. Herein, we exploit an excitation&#8208;dependent CLCs (ExD&#8208;CLCs) material by establishing dynamically photoresponsive dichroic competition between two achiral dyes: a negative dichroic dye (SP&#8208;COOH) and a positive dichroic dye (Nile Red, NR) within a CLCs medium. The ExD&#8208;CLCs exhibits a negative circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal (glum=&#8722;0.16) at 625&#8197;nm when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Remarkably, under excitation at 430&#8197;nm, the CPL signal is inverted, and the glum value increases to +0.26. Notably, the helical superstructure and handedness of the ExD&#8208;CLCs remain unchanged during this reversal process. The CPL signal reversal is driven by the dichroic competition between the SP&#8208;COOH dimer, which displays strong negative dichroism in its open&#8208;ring isomer form and silent negative dichroism in its closed&#8208;ring isomer form, and the NR dye, which exhibits static positive dichroism. Leveraging these excitation&#8208;dependent CPL properties, the quadruplex numerical anti&#8208;counterfeiting using ExD&#8208;CLCs is achieved.

         <title>A Scenario for a Carbon&#8208;Neutral Ammonia&#8208;Fueled Engine Mediated by Catalytic NH3 Cracking and CO2 Hydrogenation</title>

The direct use of ammonia as engine fuel faces challenges like low flame velocity and high NOx emissions. We propose a novel scenario for converting a conventional &#8220;CH4&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 is used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust which then reacts with NH3 to generate N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle.







Abstract
Utilizing near zero&#8208;carbon NH3 as fuel in engines is promising for carbon&#8208;neutrality. However, the application of NH3 into the engine suffers from the intrinsic poor combustion characteristics of NH3 and the emission of harmful NOx exhausts. Herein, we proposed and successfully confirmed a novel scenario for converting a conventional &#8220;CH4&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 was used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust. Afterwards, we put forward two routes to convert the exhaust and NH3 into N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle. The first &#8220;spatially decoupled&#8221; route splits the exhaust treatment into NH3 cracking over Ru clusters on the calcined Mg&#8722;Al hydrotalcite (Ru/MAO) and CO2 methanation over a commercial Ni/Al2O3. Both NH3 and CO2 were almost completely converted into the target products under their respective optimal conditions. The second &#8220;spatially coupled&#8221; route refers to an one&#8208;pot reaction of NH3 and CO2 into N2, CH4, and H2O. Due to the mismatch of reaction conditions and the competitive adsorption of reactants, the conversions of NH3 and CO2 were lowered to 80.1&#8201;% and 49.3&#8201;%, respectively, over Ru/MAO under 1&#8197;bar (CO2:NH3=3&#8201;:&#8201;8) at 550&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Elaborate Designed Three&#8208;Dimensional Hierarchical Conductive MOF/LDH/CF Nanoarchitectures for Superior Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a facile method to fabricated hierarchical composite M&#8208;CAT/LDH/CF, the well&#8208;ordered NiCoCu&#8208;LDH acts as interior templates to create an interface by embedding c&#8208;MOFs and aligning two crystal lattice systems, facilitating the graft growth of c&#8208;MOFs/LDH heterostructures along the LDH. This improves ion accessibility, speeds up ion transfer, and enhances ion transport pathways for excellent desalination performance.







Abstract
Rational exploration of cost&#8208;effective, durable, and high&#8208;performance electrode materials is imperative for advancing the progress of capacitive deionization (CDI). The integration of multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with conjugated conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) to fabricate bifunctional heterostructure electrode materials is considered a complex but promising strategy. Herein, the fabrication of elaborately designed three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical conductive MOF/LDH/CF nanoarchitectures (M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF) as CDI anodes via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy is reported. In this assembly, carbon fiber (CF) provides exceptional electrical conductivity facilitating rapid ion transfer and acts as a sturdy foundation for even distribution of NiCoCu&#8208;LDH nanosheets. Moreover, the well&#8208;ordered NiCoCu&#8208;LDH further acts as interior templates to create an interface by embedding c&#8208;MOFs and aligning two crystal lattice systems, facilitating the graft growth of c&#8208;MOFs/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanosheet arrays on CF, leading to accelerated ion diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms the unique structure of M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF promotes interfacial charge transfer from NiCoCu&#8208;LDH to M&#8211;CAT. This enhancement accelerates ion transfer, decreases ion migration energy, and leads to better ion diffusion kinetics and a smoother Cl&#8722; shuttle. Accordingly, the asymmetrical M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF cell exhibited superior specific capacitance (315 F g&#8722;1), excellent salt adsorption capacity (147.8&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), rapid rate (21.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1), and impressive cyclic stability (91.4&#8201;% retention rate). This work offers valuable insights for designing heterostructure electrode materials based on three&#8208;dimensional interconnected networks, contributing to further advancements in CDI technology.

         <title>Enantiomorphic Site&#8208;Assisted Chain End Control Stereospecific Alternating Copolymerization of Chiral Cyclic Diesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfectly alternating sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization of cyclic esters with remarkably different reactivities be a challenge, in this work, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide, and a perfectly alternating copolymer with a high alternating level was achieved and exhibited a high break strain.







Abstract
Stereospecific alternating copolymerization of different chiral cyclic esters is one feasible approach to enrich the structural diversity of copolyesters and tailor their properties. However, dramatically different reactivities of different cyclic esters let a perfectly stereospecific alternating polymerization of these cyclic esters be a challenge, thus the catalyst is required to balance their reactivities. Herein, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was discovered and successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide (S, S&#8208;LA) and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide (R, R&#8208;EG)/R, R&#8208;propylglycolide (R, R&#8208;PG) during their heterospecific alternating copolymerization. The enantiomorphic site of R, R&#8208;SalenAl complex can increase the relative reactivity of R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG and suppress that of S, S&#8208;LA, then a perfectly alternating sequence of the copolymer of S, S&#8208;LA and R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG can be achieved (Palt=0.96/0.91); inversely, using S, S&#8208;SalenAl complex, the significant enantiomorphic site effect enlarges the reactivity difference of two monomers, the alternating level was just 0.70/0.68 even to 0.61. Poly(S, S&#8208;LA&#8208;alt&#8208;R, R&#8208;EG) with a high alternating regularity exhibits lower glass transition temperatures and a dramatically higher elongation at break (&#1013;B=449&#177;51&#8201;% (Palt=0.96) vs &#1013;B=6&#177;1% (Palt=0.70)).

         <title>Achieving Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation via an Enzymatic Pathway on a Distorted CoP4 Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated. The N2 adsorption pattern on the Co&#8208;SAC switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen (N2) fixation over semiconductors has always suffered from poor conversion efficiency owing to weak N2 adsorption and the difficulty of N&#8801;N triple bond dissociation. Herein, a Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) model with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated using a selective phosphidation strategy, wherein P&#8208;doping and C defects co&#8208;regulate the local electronic structure of Co sites. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the distorted CoP4 configuration caused a strong charge redistribution between the Co atoms and adjacent C atoms, minimizing their electronegativity difference. Consequently, the N2 adsorption pattern switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode with a high N2 adsorption energy of &#8722;1.40&#8197;eV and an elongated N&#8722;N bond length of 1.20&#8197;&#197;, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway. The NH3 yielding rate peaked at 1249.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.51&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Moreover, the selective phosphidation strategy has universality for synthesizing other SACs, such as those containing Ni and Fe. This study offers new insight into co&#8208;regulating the electronic structure of SACs for efficient photocatalytic overall N2 fixation.

&lt;p&gt;A Co single-atom catalyst (SAC) with a C-defect-evoked CoP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; distorted configuration was fabricated. The N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption pattern on the Co-SAC switched from an &#8220;end-on&#8221; to a &#8220;side-on&#8221; mode, notably decreasing the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fixation over semiconductors has always suffered from poor conversion efficiency owing to weak N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and the difficulty of N&#8801;N triple bond dissociation. Herein, a Co single-atom catalyst (SAC) model with a C-defect-evoked CoP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; distorted configuration was fabricated using a selective phosphidation strategy, wherein P-doping and C defects co-regulate the local electronic structure of Co sites. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the distorted CoP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration caused a strong charge redistribution between the Co atoms and adjacent C atoms, minimizing their electronegativity difference. Consequently, the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption pattern switched from an &#8220;end-on&#8221; to a &#8220;side-on&#8221; mode with a high N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption energy of &#8722;1.40&#8197;eV and an elongated N&#8722;N bond length of 1.20&#8197;&#197;, notably decreasing the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway. The NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yielding rate peaked at 1249.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an apparent quantum yield of 3.51&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Moreover, the selective phosphidation strategy has universality for synthesizing other SACs, such as those containing Ni and Fe.

         <title>Enhancing Low&#8208;Concentration Electroreduction of NO to NH3 via Potential&#8208;Controlled Active Site&#8208;Intermediate Interactions</title>

The electrode potential adjust the interaction between active sites and intermediates for enhancing NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion over VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x.







Abstract
Electronic defect states in catalysts are recognized as highly effective active sites for enhancing the low&#8208;concentration electroreduction of NO to NH3 (NORR). Their structures dynamically evolve with applied electrode potentials, allowing the active sites to adjust interactions with intermediates, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. However, the dynamic changes in these interactions under applied potentials remain poorly understood, hindering the design of more diverse electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we developed a strategy that unitizes electrode potential to control the interactions between active sites and intermediates over oxygen vacancy&#8208;modified TiO2 (VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x) to enhance NORR performance. By combining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art constant inner potential (CIP) DFT calculations with in situ (spectro)electrochemical measurements, we investigated how the electrode potential influences these interactions in NORR. The results clearly demonstrate that applying an external potential alters the spatial symmetry of degenerate orbitals of Ti3+ to facilitate the generation of key intermediates for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Therefore, the VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x catalyst exhibited superior NORR performance with a NH3 Faradaic efficiency up to 76.4&#8201;% and a high NH3 yield rate of 632.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;vol&#8201;% NO atmosphere, which is competitive with those of previously reported works under higher NO concentration (above 10&#8197;vol&#8201;%). Remarkably, the NORR process achieved a record&#8208;breaking NH3 yield of 2292.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under the same conditions. This study opens a new avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic activity by adjusting operating conditions, thereby transcending the limitations of material design.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Intramolecular Reaction of Alkynes with Sulfoximines Acting as N&#8208; and O&#8208;Transfer Reagents</title>

Sulfoximines are presented as selective N&#8208; and O&#8208;transfer reagents to alkynes in the gold&#8208;catalysed transformation of N&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl) sulfoximines to 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The nature of the reaction mechanism is discussed based on both experimental and theoretical studies. Due to external oxidants being avoided, the methodology exhibits an excellent functional group tolerance and can be combined with further transformations in one&#8208;pot procedures.







Abstract
Among the nucleophilic oxidants employed in the gold&#8208;catalysed oxidation of alkynes, sulphur&#8208;based reagents have played a substantial role since the beginning, granting access to the respective gold carbene intermediates. Herein, we describe the first example of the substance class of sulfoximines being used as atom transfer reagents to alkynes in gold catalysis. Based on the transformation of N&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl) sulfoximines to 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, it is demonstrated that the sulfoximine functionality is capable of selectively transferring first its nitrogen moiety to the alkyne, forming the &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene, which is then oxidised by the released sulfoxide moiety in a second step via a pseudo&#8208;intramolecular mechanism&#8212;a distinctive feature that differentiates this work mechanistically from earlier studies. A combination of extensive experimental and theoretical studies provides evidence for this mechanistic rationale. As no external reagents for the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalisation of the alkyne unit are required, a wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the transformation, affording the desired 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones in mostly good yields. It was further also showcased that it is possible to combine our methodology with additional transformations of the 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;one core in one&#8208;pot procedures, allowing facile access to C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one structures.

         <title>Insights Into the Role of &#960;&#8208;Electrons of Aromatic Aldehydes in Passivating Perovskite Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of &#960;&#8208;electrons in the carbonyl&#8208;containing aromatic materials on their passivation ability was thoroughly investigated. With the increase of aromatic conjugated system, the increased &#960;&#8208;electrons mainly enhance the defect passivation of the carbonyl group, although they do not directly present strong passivation with the defects in the perovskite films. Finally, perovskite solar cells incorporating pyrene&#8208;1&#8208;carbaldehyde achieved power conversion efficiencies of 25.67&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.76&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2) with excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing aromatic ketones or aldehydes have been demonstrated to be effective defect passivators for perovskite films to improve performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It has been claimed that both &#960;&#8208;electrons within aromatic units and carbonyl groups can, separately, interact with ionic defects, which, however, causes troubles in understanding the passivation mechanism of those aromatic ketone/aldehyde molecules. Herein, we clarify the effect of both moieties in one molecule on the defect passivation by investigating three aromatic aldehydes with varied conjugation planes, namely, biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carbaldehyde (BPCA), naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (NACA) and pyrene&#8208;1&#8208;carbaldehyde (PyCA). Our findings reveal that the &#960;&#8208;electrons located in the conjugated system do not directly present strong passivation for defects, but enhance the electron cloud density of the carbonyl group augmenting its interaction with defect sites; thereby, with the extended conjugation plane of the three molecules, their defect passivation ability is gradually improved. PSCs incorporating PyCA with the most extended &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalization achieve maximum power conversion efficiencies of 25.67&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.76&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2). Moreover, these devices exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after operation for 1000&#8197;hours at the maximum power point.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Dynamic Hydrogen Isotope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

As configurational entropy increases, bulky functionalities progressively block the apertures in sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, enabling programmable control over the pore structure. This controlled reduction in porosity enhances selective interactions with hydrogen isotopes. The gradual tightening of apertures directly impacts gas adsorption and separation performance, particularly in hydrogen isotope separation.







Abstract
Entropy&#8208;driven strategy enables the systematic design of complex systems by using entropy as a quantifiable design parameter for the degree of mixing. In this study, we present mixed&#8208;linker zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, that features two types of six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) with aperture sizes of 3.4&#8197;&#197; and 1.7&#8197;&#197;. By adjusting the configurational entropy, the ratio of these 6MRs can be systematically controlled, which significantly influences adsorptive properties, particularly improving the H2 affinity about 3&#8197;times throughout the series. This results in the significant enhancement of retention times in dynamic separation of hydrogen isotopes (D2/H2), even over LNG liquefaction temperature. This approach to entropy&#8208;driven pore engineering provides new opportunities for enhancing gas adsorption and separation processes.

         <title>&#8220;Double&#8208;Gene&#8221; Small Molecule as Guest Component Promotes the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Beyond 19.5&#8201;%</title>

A new &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule L&#8208;DBDD is synthesized based on the concept of &#8220;structural&#8208;gene&#8220; engineering by combination of the parent structures of donor and acceptor. It is employed as a guest component and a bridge to enhance the donor&#8208;acceptor interaction and accelerate exciton dissociation and transmission, enabling efficiency of solar cell reaching 19.51&#8201;%.







Abstract
Introduction of a guest component into the active layer is a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite various guest components successfully employed in the OSCs, efficient guest components require deliberate design and ingenious inspiration, which still remains a big challenge for developing high performance OSCs. In this work, we propose a concept of &#8220;structural gene&#8221; engineering to create a new &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule (L&#8208;DBDD) by simply combining the structures of both donor PM6 and acceptor L8&#8208;BO. L&#8208;DBDD inherit the features of both donor and acceptor, which naturally acts as a bridge between donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces to strengthen D/A interactions and compatibility. Incorporation of this &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule into the active layer can facilitate rapid charge dissociation and simultaneously optimize molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L&#8208;DBDD&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO blend achieves a top power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.51&#8201;%, significantly suppressing the binary control device (PCE=18.52&#8201;%). These results demonstrate that the design concept of &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule by combination of the &#8220;structural gene&#8221; of donor and acceptor provides a simple and meaningful guideline for guest component&#8208;assisted highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Unlocking CO2 Activation With a Novel Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of the divalent precursor (&#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P'&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3)NiBr has given the diamagnetic trinuclear complex [Ni2Hg] featuring two (formally) monovalent Ni centers bonded to a bridging mercury atom. The thermally stable but fairly labile Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni core in [Ni2Hg] facilitates a smooth disproportionation of CO2, according to the net equation &#8220;2&#8197;CO2+2&#8197;e&#8722;&#8594;CO32&#8722;+CO&#8221;. This process begins with an initial CO2 insertion that expels Hg to give the intermediate [Ni2CO2], whereas the latter can promote a second CO2 insertion followed by CO gas release to give [Ni2CO3]. This &#956;&#8208;carbonate species can be reduced with Na/Hg to regenerate the original complex [Ni2Hg].







Abstract
Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni core (POCOP=&#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P'&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate&#8208;bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its &#956;&#8208;CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32&#8722; and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter's decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a &#956;&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;carbonate rather than a &#956;&#8208;oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of [Ni2CO3] with excess Na/Hg regenerates [Ni2Hg], establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO2 in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.

A photosensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy was proposed based on POM@MOF molecular platform to construct the highly efficient catalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Impressively, the resulting Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 can efficiently drive water splitting into H2 with a TON of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composites.







Abstract
Photocatalytic efficiency is closely correlated to visible&#8208;light absorption ability, electron transfer efficiency and catalytic center activity of photocatalysts, nevertheless, the concurrent management of these factors to improve photocatalytic efficiency remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a sensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy on the polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Framework (POM@MOF) molecular platform to construct highly efficient photocatalysts. Impressively, Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6, obtained by coupling strong sensitizing [Ir(coumarin 6)2(bpy)]+ with Ni&#8722;Sb9 POM with extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3], can drive H2 evolution with a turnover number of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composite photocatalysts. This performance is over 34&#8197;times higher than that of the typical Ni4P2@UiO&#8722;Ir constructed from [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and Ni4P2 POM. Systematical investigations revealed that dual regulation of sensitizing and catalytic centers endowed Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 with strong visible&#8208;light absorption, efficient inter&#8208;component electron transfer and high catalytic activity to concurrently promote H2 evolution. This work opens up a new avenue to develop highly active POM@MOF photocatalysts by dual regulation of sensitizing/catalytic centers at the molecular level.

         <dc:description>
An orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (T&#8208;Nb2O5) based lithium&#8208;ion capacitor diode (CAPode) with thoroughly improved response frequency and rectification ratio has been successfully developed. It is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations.







Abstract
Ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operation is recognized as the most promising approach to achieving in&#8208;depth brain&#8208;inspired computing, but the lack of high&#8208;performance ion/electron&#8208;coupling devices with high operating frequencies much restricts the fast development of this field. Accordingly, we herein report an orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (T&#8208;Nb2O5) based lithium&#8208;ion capacitor diode (CAPode) that possesses thoroughly improved performances to achieve multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations. Specifically, benefiting from the unique crystal structure and fast ion&#8208;transport topology of T&#8208;Nb2O5, the constructed CAPode exhibits a high response frequency of up to 122&#8197;Hz, over three orders of magnitude higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CAPodes. Meanwhile, the T&#8208;Nb2O5 based CAPode delivers a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 108, a high specific capacity of 390&#8197;C&#8201;g&#8722;1, a wide voltage window of &#8722;1.5&#8211;1.5&#8197;V, and a superior cycling stability over 2000 cycles. Combining these performance advantages, the T&#8208;Nb2O5 based CAPode is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations.

         <title>Coulombic Condensation of Liquefied Gas Electrolytes for Li Metal Batteries at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethyl ether (Me2O) gas can be condensed through ion&#8208;dipole interactions with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide at sufficiently high concentrations, which elevates the boiling of point Me2O, imparting enhanced physical and electrochemical properties for battery applications. The approach of Coulombic condensation by facilitating ion&#8208;dipole interactions with weakly coordinating solvents offers a promising strategy for next&#8208;generation electrolyte design.







Abstract
The concept of employing highly concentrated electrolytes has been widely incorporated into electrolyte design, due to their enhanced Li&#8208;metal passivation and oxidative stability compared to their diluted counterparts. However, issues such as high viscosity and sub&#8208;optimal wettability, compromise their suitability for commercialization. In this study, we present a highly concentrated dimethyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte that appears as a liquid phase at ambient conditions via Li+ &#8208; solvents ion&#8208;dipole interactions (Coulombic condensation). Unlike conventional high salt concentration ether&#8208;based electrolytes, it demonstrates enhanced transport properties and fluidity. The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure also contributes to the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich salt&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase, facilitating stable Li metal cycling for over 1000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 condition. When combined with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode, the electrolyte effectively reduces the polysulfide shuttling effect and ensures stable performance across a range of charging currents, up to 6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research underscores a promising strategy for developing an anion&#8208;rich, high concentration ether electrolyte with decreased viscosity, which supports a Li metal anode with exceptional temperature durability and rapid charging capabilities.

         <title>Fluorination from Surface to Bulk Stabilizing High Nickel Cathode Materials with Outstanding Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through interfacial fluorination and introducing F ions to bulk phase as anchors, the high&#8208;voltage high&#8208;rate cycling performance of high nickel cathodes is boosted. The fluorinated surface induces the formation of a thin, dense CEI layer to facilitate Li+ migration and hinder electrolyte erosion. Additionally, the substitution of F for O in bulk phase forms strong TM&#8722;F bonds, thereby enhancing surface and internal structural stability, and hindering the formation of microcracks and gas evolution.







Abstract
High nickel layered oxides provide high energy densities as cathodes for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, critical issues such as capacity fading and voltage decay, which derive from labile surface reactivity and phase transition, especially under high&#8208;rate high&#8208;voltage conditions, prevent their commercialization. Here we propose a fluorination strategy to simultaneously introduce F atoms into oxygen layer and create a F aggregated interface. Substitution F for O stabilizes the layered ionic framework as the F ions can anchor the internal transition metal ions through strong TM&#8722;F bonding interaction, alleviating anisotropic lattice strain accumulation and release during the cycle, and promoting the Li+ dynamics diffusion. Meanwhile, the fluorinated interface induces the formation of a thin and stable CEI, ameliorating the detrimental issues like oxygen vacancy formation, the HF attacks and metal dissolution. The resultant fluorinated cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 192.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C within the voltage range of 2.7&#8211;4.5&#8197;V. This fluorination strategy approach provides design concepts for the advanced cathodes that can meet the demands of high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;voltage applications in next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design for Balanced Locally Excited and Charge&#8208; Transfer Nature for Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Phenomenon and Highly Efficient TADF&#8208;Based OLEDs</title>

Synergistic modulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugation and electron&#8208;donating strengths has been used to induce hybridized localized electronic and charge&#8208;transfer characters. This has led to donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (&#960;&#8208;DAD) structures showing a maintained elevated two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section value and highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
The pursuit of highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) character is hampered by the concurrent achievement of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL). Here, by introducing a terephthalonitrile unit into a sterically crowded donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structure, inducing a hybrid electronic excitation character, we designed unique TADF emitters possessing 2PA ability. This rational molecular design was achieved through a main &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor backbone in line with locally excited feature renders a large oscillator strength and transition dipole moment, maintaining a high 2PA cross&#8208;section value. The ancillary N&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor with charge transfer character highly balances the TADF phenomenon by minimizing &#916;EST. A near&#8208;unity &#934;PL value with a large radiative decay rate over an order of magnitude higher than the intersystem crossing rate and a high horizontal orientation ratio of 0.95 were simultaneously attained for TPCz2NP. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with this material exhibit a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% with an elevated 2PA cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) value up to 143&#8197;GM at 850&#8197;nm. These findings offer a venue for designing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional performance inclusive of 2PA properties, expanding for future functional material design.

         <title>Unveiling Chirality in MoS2 Nanosheets: A Breakthrough in Phase Engineering for Enhanced Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor 2H Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets with high chiroptical activity have been produced using a novel synthetic strategy based on phase engineering. Our approach is based on the conversion of chiral metastable metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase via a thermal annealing step specifically designed to preserve the chiral morphology during the metallic&#8208;to&#8208;semiconductor phase transition.







Abstract
The development of new synthetic strategies to introduce and control chirality in inorganic nanostructures has been highly stimulated by the broad spectrum of potential applications of these exiting nanomaterials. Molybdenum disulfide is among the most investigated transition metal dichalcogenides due to its promising properties for applications that spread from optoelectronic to spintronic. Herein, we report a new two&#8208;step approach for the production of chiroptically active semiconductor 2H MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology based on the manipulation of their crystallographic structure. In the first step, metastable metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology were produced via hydrothermal synthesis. Then, thermal annealing was used to progressively tune the conversion of the metallic 1T phase into the thermodynamically stable semiconductor 2H phase while preserving the nanocrystals&#8217; chiral morphology. Our detailed study covers the evolution of the chiroptical properties of the material during the crystallographic phase transition, revealing critical insights into the formation of chiroptically active excitonic transitions. This study represents a unique approach to the production of high&#8208;quality chiral nanomaterials by exploiting phase engineering, and paves the way for the development of new synthetic methods to further expand the range and properties of chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Driven Oxygen Vacancy Diffusion and Healing on TiO2(110) at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the initial CO2 activation processes on the reduced TiO2(110) surface by using in situ ambient&#8208;pressure techniques. The interactions between oxygen vacancy, Ti3+ interstitial, and CO2 molecules are revealed depending on CO2(g) pressure and observation time. The oxygen vacancy diffusion mechanism and dynamics of physisorbed CO2 modes are unraveled.







Abstract
Understanding how TiO2 interacts with CO2 at the molecular level is crucial in the CO2 reduction toward value&#8208;added energy sources. Here, we report in situ observations of the CO2 activation process on the reduced TiO2(110) surface at room temperature using ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that oxygen vacancies (Vo) diffuse dynamically along the bridging oxygen (Obr) rows of the TiO2(110) surface under ambient CO2(g) environments. This physical phenomenon exclusively occurs when the oxygen abstracted upon CO2 dissociation instantly occupies the Vo sites of Obr rows on the TiO2(110), whereas the TiO2(110) surface without the Vo only allows CO2 physisorption on five&#8208;fold&#8208;coordinated Ti4+ sites. Synchrotron&#8208;based ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy also identifies the changes in surface oxidation states of TiO2(110) by the healing of Vo sites or the CO2 physisorption under ambient CO2(g) conditions. Density functional theory calculations propose a mechanism of the CO2&#8208;driven Vo diffusion and the physisorbed CO2 configurations. Our combined results unravel the critical role of defect sites on TiO2 in determining the elementary step of CO2 activation during chemical reactions.

         <title>Construction of Linear Tetramer&#8208;Type Acceptors for High&#8208;Efficiency and High&#8208;Stability Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully constructed two linear tetramer&#8208;type acceptor materials, G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, terminating in the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing INCN&#8208;2F. Both tetramers have molecular weights in excess of 7,000. DFT calculations and experimental results show that the fully alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 has an almost completely planar molecular structure and relatively strong crystallinity. In addition, G&#8208;1&#8208;based OSC achieved high PCE (19.6&#8201;%) and high stability (T80 lifetime over 10000&#8197;hours).







Abstract
Thanks to the development of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has exceeded 20&#8201;%, which has met the requirements for commercialisation. In the current stage, the main focus is to balance the performance and stability. It has been shown that all&#8208;polymer formulation can improve device stability, however, PCE is not in satifsfaction, and the batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation leads to quality control issues. In this work, we constructed monodispersed tetramer NFA materials named G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, to best integrate the merits of small molecule and polymer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results showed that different connecting units at the centre could significantly affect the molecular planarity and thin film morphology. The alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 had a more regioregular structure, which leads to better molecular planarity, and more ordered packing in thin film. More importantly, the oligomeration induced a favourable face&#8208;on orientation, achieved a lower binding energy and exhibited a higher photoluminescence yield. As a result, the exciton and charge carrier kinetics was optimized with reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss. The OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;G&#8208;1 achieved a PCE of 19.6&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE reported so far for oligomer&#8208;based binary OSC. In addition, the device stability was largely improved, showing a lifetime over 10000&#8197;hours in the inverted OSC device.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Azidofunctionalization of Alkenes via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes using a hypervalent iodine reagent and various nucleophiles (Nu) under photoredox conditions is described. This method enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products from a wide range of alkenes and nucleophiles significantly improving the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates. The generality and limitations of the approach in the alkene and nucleophile dimensions were examined through a standardized, unbiased substrate selection.







Abstract
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes under mild conditions using commercially available starting materials and easily accessible reagents is reported based on a radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy. A broad range of alkenes, including vinyl arenes, enamides, enol ethers, vinyl sulfides, and dehydroamino esters, were regioselectively functionalized with an azide and nucleophiles such as azoles, carboxylic acids, alcohols, phosphoric acids, oximes, and phenols. The method led to a more efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azidofunctionalized pharmaceutical intermediates when compared to previous approaches, resulting in both reduction of step count and increase in overall yield. The scope and limitations of these transformations were further investigated through a standard unbiased selection of 15 substrate combinations out of 1,175,658 possible using a clustering technique.

         <title>Strong Heteroatomic Bond&#8208;Induced Confined Restructuring on Ir&#8722;Mn Intermetallics Enable Robust PEM Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the contribution of the atomic ordering strategy to the favorable reconstruction in acidic OER. The in&#8197;situ confined reconstruction layer with strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units induced by the rich strong heteroatomic bonds of Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallics (IMC) optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and suppresses the participation of lattice oxygen, thus achieving a double breakthrough in activity and stability.







Abstract
Low&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in&#8197;situ reconstruction of Ir&#8208;based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom&#8208;bonded structure triggers rational surface&#8208;confined reconstruction to form self&#8208;stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in&#8197;situ/ex&#8197;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6&#8197;times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir&#8722;Mn IMC as anode &#8220;pre&#8208;electrocatalyst&#8221; (0.24&#8197;mgIr&#8201;cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2@1.851&#8197;V@80&#8201;&#176;C) and runs stably at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 2,000&#8197;h with the cost of USD&#8197;0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface&#8208;confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering of Chalcogen&#8208;Bridged Chiral Molecules for Efficient OLEDs with Diverse Luminescence Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing isomeric molecular engineering to tune electronic and vibrational spin&#8208;orbital coupling effects, several chiral molecules have been developed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The TADF&#8208;based OLEDs achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;%, and by modulating the TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission has been realized.







Abstract
The exploration of circularly polarized luminescence is important for advancing display and lighting technologies. Herein, by utilizing isomeric molecular engineering, a novel series of chiral molecules are designed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The cooperation of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, moderate spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC), and large oscillator strength enables efficient TADF emission, with photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. By altering the symmetry of molecular structures, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic electronic SOC and vibrational SOC effects can be greatly enhanced to facilitate RTP emission. Notably, through modulating simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission is successfully achieved. Accordingly, the TADF&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 30&#8201;%, representing exceptional performance of non&#8208;aromatic amine&#8208;based emitters. Furthermore, the first single&#8208;molecule white OLED based on TADF and RTP dual&#8208;emissive chiral material is developed, establishing a benchmark for the development of advanced display and lighting technologies.

         <title>Breaking the Stability&#8208;Activity Trade&#8208;off of Oxygen Electrocatalyst by Gallium Bilateral&#8208;Regulation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy was developed to optimize the electronic environment of Mn&#8722;O and Ru&#8722;O in Ga/MnRuO2 by doping Ga to overcome the activity&#8208;stability restriction of bifunctional electrocatalysts and thus achieving the high bifunctional performance for ORR/OER and zinc&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
The rational design of metal oxide catalysts with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is crucial for the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs). Precisely regulating the electronic environment of metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) active species is critical yet challenging for improving their activity and stability toward OER and ORR. Herein, we propose an atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy by introducing atomically dispersed Ga for continuously tuning the electronic environment of Ru&#8722;O and Mn&#8722;O in the Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst. The Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst breaks the stability&#8208;activity restriction, showing remarkable bifunctional performance with a low potential gap (&#916;E) of 0.605&#8197;V and super durability with negligible performance degradation (300,000 ORR cycles or 30,000 OER cycles). The theoretical calculations revealed that the strong coupling electron interactions between Ga and Ru&#8722;O/Mn&#8722;O tuned the valence state distribution of the metal center, effectively modulating the adsorption behavior of *O/*OH, thus optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the reaction barriers. The a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs based on Ga/MnRuO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance with a wide working temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C and a long lifetime of 2308&#8197;hours (i.e., 13,848&#8197;cycles) under a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Anionic Doping in Layered Transition Metal Chalcogenides for Robust Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of vacancies and lattice distortion induced by ionic doping in layered transition metal chalcogenides is elucidated as a key factor in enhancing charge transfer during the Li&#8722;S reaction, providing valuable insights for designing advanced cathode materials for next&#8208;generation sulfur&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, a slow Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics at the LSB cathode limit their energy and power densities. To address these challenges, this study introduces an anionic&#8208;doped transition metal chalcogenide as an effective catalyst to accelerate the Li&#8722;S reaction. Specifically, a tellurium&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported bismuth selenide with Se vacancies (Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C) is prepared and tested as a sulfur host in LSB cathodes. X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that Te doping induces lattice distortions and modulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Bi atoms to promote the catalytic activity toward the conversion of polysulfides. Additionally, the generated Se vacancies alter the electronic structure around atomic defect sites, increase the carrier concentration, and activate unpaired cations to effectively trap polysulfides. As a result, LSBs based on Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C/S cathodes demonstrate outstanding specific capacities of 1508&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, excellent rate performance with 655&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, and near&#8208;integral cycle stability over 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a cathode capacity exceeding 8&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is sustained at 0.1&#8197;C current rate, with 6.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 retained after 300&#8197;cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydroxylation and Oxidative Coupling Reactions Mediated by Multinuclear Au(I) Supramolecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;nuclearity Au(I) cluster photocatalysts (Au4 and Au16) were precisely synthesized using a multicomponent collaborative self&#8208;assembly strategy. Both supramolecular clusters demonstrated photocatalytic capabilities for the oxidative hydrolysis of phenylboronic acid and the oxidative coupling of benzylamines under mild conditions, achieving catalytic efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;%. Notably, the photocatalytic efficiency for the oxidation of arylboric acid is currently the highest.







Abstract
Polynuclear Au(I) cluster photocatalysts, known for their high activity and stability, hold substantial potential in organic synthetic chemistry. This study synthesized two Au(I) supramolecular cluster catalysts with different nuclearities: a tetranuclear cluster, C1 ([(dppmAu2)2L1]&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;PF6&#8722;), and a hexadecanuclear cluster, C2 [(dppmAu2)6(Au4)(L1)4]&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;4PF6&#8722;, through a multicomponent stepwise self&#8208;assembly approach. Both cluster structures feature aurophilicity interaction motifs that endow them with exceptional photocatalytic performance, exhibiting optical band gaps of 2.27&#8197;eV and 2.41&#8197;eV, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, these clusters efficiently generate reactive oxygen species, significantly enhancing their photocatalytic efficacy for the oxidative hydroxylation of phenylboronic acids and oxidative coupling of benzylamines under mild conditions. Catalytic efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% were achieved. Turnover frequencies for C2 and C1 were measured at 52.045&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 6.030&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, representing the highest efficiencies reported for photocatalysts to date. Compared to C1, C2 exhibited superior photocatalytic activity, attributed to its higher photoelectric sensitivity and greater exposure of active metal sites. Using a combination of experimental data and density functional theory calculations, the plausible mechanisms were proposed for two photocatalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that the use of multicomponent cooperative self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize high&#8208;nuclearity Au(I) clusters offers innovative pathways for the development of efficient, green, light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for Precise Control of Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space conjugation in a series of tetraphenylalkanes&#8208;based nonconjugated clusteroluminogens is engineered via high&#8208;pressure structural regulation. Abnormal blue shift and remarkable emission enhancement are realized, exhibiting distinct structural factors. Intense white&#8208;light emission is realized after high&#8208;pressure treatment, disrupting the typical excited&#8208;state even&#8208;odd effects in ambient study.







Abstract
Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Different from the through&#8208;bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminophores, through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)&#8208;based CLgens at molecular level. High&#8208;pressure exploration enables accurate manipulation of clusteroluminescence and elucidates the intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationships involved. Upon initial compression, the predominant molecular distortions marked by increased interfacial angles between benzene rings diminish TSC, resulting in anomalous hypochromatic shift in emission. Subsequently, considerable structural contraction enhances TSC and suppresses molecular motion, resulting in a pronouncedly enhanced and bathochromic&#8208;shifted emission. Notably, a series of TPAs&#8208;based CLgens exhibit intense white&#8208;light emission upon pressure release, attributed to irreversible structural distortion and destruction. This study not only advances the understanding of CLgens, but also underscores the crucial structural factors for effective TSC control, paving the way for establishing new photophysical theories for aggregate science.

         <title>Cascade Selenization Regulated the Electronic Structure and Interface Effect of Transition Metal Sulfides for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, dual&#8208;effect based on electronic structure engineering and interface engineering, cascade Se substitution drives the formation of active species Se&#8722;CoS2 and CoS2/CoSe2 heterojunction. The optimized Se&#8722;CoS2/CoSe2 delivers a high sodium storage performance in half/full cells.







Abstract
The utilization of cobalt&#8208;based sulfides is constrained by their inherently low conductivity and slow sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Modifying the electronic configuration and constructing heterostructures are promising strategies to enhance intrinsic conductivity and expedite the sodium ion diffusion process. In this study, heterogeneous nanoparticles of Se&#8208;substituted CoS2/CoSe2, embedded within heteroatom&#8208;modified carbon nanosheet, were synthesized using metal molten salt&#8208;assisted dimensionality reduction alongside concurrent sulfurization and selenization techniques. The incorporation of Se into CoS2 markedly enhances its intrinsic conductivity, thereby significantly improving its rate performance. The elongated Co&#8722;S bonds and the formation of CoSe2 species contribute to the acceleration of dynamics and facilitate the construction of the CoS2/CoSe2 heterointerface. In situ Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, has elucidated the sodium storage mechanism of the Se&#8722;CoS2/CoSe2 and the underlying factors contributing to its enhanced performance. The synergistic effects of interface engineering and electronic structure engineering, have resulted in the optimized Se&#8722;CoS2/CoSe2 demonstrating exceptional rate performance, achieving 442&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a prolonged cycle lifespan, maintaining 409.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 2100&#8197;cycles and 262.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 7000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study presents a viable strategy for integrating electronic structure engineering with interface engineering.

The elongated Co&#8722;S bonds and the formation of CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species contribute to the acceleration of dynamics and facilitate the construction of the CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterointerface. In situ Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, has elucidated the sodium storage mechanism of the Se&#8722;CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the underlying factors contributing to its enhanced performance. The synergistic effects of interface engineering and electronic structure engineering, have resulted in the optimized Se&#8722;CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrating exceptional rate performance, achieving 442&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a prolonged cycle lifespan, maintaining 409.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 2100&#8197;cycles and 262.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 7000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study presents a viable strategy for integrating electronic structure engineering with interface engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Cage&#8208;Confined Cations Molecular Dynamics toward High&#8208;Tc Perovskite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the cage&#8208;confinement effect is established to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics, of which the Tc is dramatically promoted to 402&#8197;K (&gt;BaTiO3, 393&#8197;K). Further, Deep understanding of cage&#8208;confinement effect and high&#8208;Tc ferroelectricity is well elaborated by combining in situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations on potential energies. This paves a new pathway and makes a breakthrough in the field of molecular ferroelectrics.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;confinement effect that imposes great constriction on the dynamic behaviors of guest molecules is an established platform for tailoring physical properties. Herein, the strategy of enhancing cage&#8208;confinement effect to control molecular motion has been probed for the first time to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics of 2D hybrid perovskites. By fine&#8208;tailoring of the confined cations inside the perovskite cavities, we have successfully obtained new homologous ferroelectrics of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Cl10 (1; BA=n&#8208;butylamine, MA=methylamine) and (BA)2(EA)2Pb3Cl10 (2; EA=ethylamine). Intriguingly, this dynamics modulation of cage&#8208;confined cations leads to a remarkable promotion of Curie temperature (Tc), boosting from 340&#8197;K (for 1) to 402&#8197;K (for 2). In situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations on energy barrier confirm that the larger EA cation in 2 is subject to stronger confinement effect, of which potential energy barrier of molecular motion is ~3.5&#8197;times that of MA cation. This dynamic behavior greatly suppresses the dynamic motions of EA cation, while MA cation can easily accelerate motion and reach a fast motion limit, thus accounting for an enhancement of Tc (&#916;T~62&#8197;K) in 2. The finding sheds light on the understanding of cage&#8208;confined electric orders and the precise design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics.

         <title>Thiosulfate&#8208;Mediated Polysulfide Redox for Energetic Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides significantly impeded the performance of sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs). We proposed an effective redox regulation strategy via a thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction within the K2S2O3 electrolyte, which accelerates the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;) and provides an additional capacity contribution through the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;). The thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB exhibits an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 616&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs) are regarded as promising candidates for safe, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy storage. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides pose a significant challenge to the practical performance of SABs. Herein, we report a unique redox regulation strategy that leverages thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction to accelerate the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;). The S2O32&#8722; species in the electrolyte can induce the rapid reduction of polysulfide through a spontaneous chemical reaction with sulfur species, while facilitating the reversible oxidation of short&#8208;chain sulfides. Moreover, the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;) within the K2S2O3 electrolyte contributes additional capacity at higher potential (E0 &gt;0&#8197;V vs SHE). Consequently, the elaborate SAB delivers an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470&#8197;mAh&#8201;gs&#8722;1, coupled with a long cycling life exceeding 1000 cycles. Remarkably, thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB achieves an energy density of 616&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems. This work elucidates the mechanism underlying the thiosulfate&#8208;mediated polysulfide redox process, thereby opening a pathway for the development of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Tyrosinase&#8208;Catalyzed Peptide Stapling Using Para&#8208;Amino Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Anchoring Residues</title>

A tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain peptide stapling between p&#8208;amino phenylalanine (Z) and tyrosine (Y) amino acids has been developed.







Abstract
Peptide stapling techniques have historically relied on metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reactions, with no examples using enzymes. Here, inspired by tyrosinase&#8208;mediated oxidation, we describe the efficient side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain coupling of p&#8208;amino phenylalanine (Z) and tyrosine (Y) amino acids using a commercially available tyrosinase. Stapling reactions between the i, i+3 to i, i+7 positions were all performed, proceeding in good conversion and under mild conditions compatible with various side chains, functional motifs and ring sizes, with the Z&#8722;Y product found to be more stable and obtained in a higher yield than the Y&#8722;Z product. Z&#8722;Y stapled versions of ER, MC4 and GPR54 binding peptides exhibited higher serum stability, helical content and binding affinity than their linear counterparts, proving the utility of our method to synthesize biologically significant peptides. The tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8722;Y peptide stapling technique expands the scope of available stapling techniques, and is proposed to develop stapled peptide drug candidates.

         <title>P&#8208;Dopant with Spherical Anion for Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The spherical dopant (Na&#8208;TFPB) was developed to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells via adjusting various factors such as defect passivation ability and doping effect. The doping uniformity of spherical Na&#8208;TFPB is better than that of linear Li&#8208;TFSI. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49&#8201;% and 24.31&#8201;% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values recorded for organic dopants to date.







Abstract
Li&#8208;TFSI/t&#8208;BP is the most widely utilized p&#8208;dopant for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, its nonuniformity of doping, along with the hygroscopicity and migration of dopants, results in the devices exhibiting limited stability and performance. This study reports on the utilization of a spherical anion derived from the p&#8208;dopant, regulated by its radius and shape, as an alternative to the linear TFSI&#8722; anion. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the spherical anion significantly increases the doping effect of HTMs due to an enhanced electron transfer from larger dipole moments. The enhanced transfer leads to a shift in the Pb&#8208;6p defect orbitals, resulting in shallower trap states. Moreover, compared to the linear structure of the TFSI&#8722; anion, the anion of sodium tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoro methyl)phenyl]borate (Na&#8208;TFPB) with a larger van der Waals radius and spherical shape offers increased hydrophobicity and migration barriers, which can protect the perovskite crystal and facilitate stable p&#8208;doping of HTMs. The use of Na&#8208;TFPB results in enhanced thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49&#8201;% and 24.31&#8201;% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values for organic dopants to date. This study underscores the ingenious design of spherical anions of p&#8208;dopants in contrast to the conventional linear anions.

         <title>Fluoromethyl Triflate and Fluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate: Easily Accessible and Powerful Fluoromethylation Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile fluoromethylation reagents fluoromethyl triflate (superfluoromethyl, SFM, FH2COSO2CF3) and fluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (magic fluoromethyl, MFM, FH2COSO2F) have been made easily accessible. Both contain long O&#8722;CH2F bonds characteristic for electrophilic monofluoromethylation reactivity and are able to fluoromethylate various chalcogen&#8208;based nucleophiles in short reaction times, high yields and with easy work&#8208;up.







Abstract
Fluoromethyl triflate (superfluoromethyl, SFM, FH2COSO2CF3) and fluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (magic fluoromethyl, MFM, FH2COSO2F) are two easily synthesized, highly effective and non&#8208;ozone depleting fluoromethylation reagents. They are analogous to the well&#8208;known and widely used methylation reagents H3COSO2CF3 and H3COSO2F. Both SFM and MFM have been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 17O, 19F, 33S). Their structures have been determined in the solid state on in&#8197;situ grown crystals by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in the gas phase by electron diffraction. The fluoromethylation efficiency of SFM and MFM was shown by reactions with chalcogen nucleophiles of differing nucleophilicity. All fluoromethylated products were isolated as pure compounds and characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, as well as in some cases by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Cooperation of Multifunctional Redox Mediator and Separator Modification to Enhance Li&#8208;S Batteries Performance under Low Electrolyte/Sulfur Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique redox mediator (RM) molecule ethyl viologen (EtV2+), owning two well matched redox couples (EtV2+/EtV+, EtV+/EtV0) towards redox chemistry of sulfur species, is demonstrated to function as multifunctional catalysts for reducing S, modulating Li2S nucleation and oxidizing Li2S simultaneously. Its electropositive nature in oxidation state allows the synergetic inhibition of shuttle effect of EtV2+/ EtV+ when coupling with separator modification with electronegative &#8208;SO3Li groups and the electrically&#8208;charged EtV2+ and LiPSs.







Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur species fundamentally trigger the incomplete conversion of S8&#8596;Li2S and restricted lifespan of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, especially under high sulfur loading and/or low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios. Developing redox mediators (RMs) is an effective strategy to boost the battery reaction kinetics, yet their multifunctionality and shuttle inhibition are still not available. Here, a unique ethyl viologen (EtV2+) RM with two highly reversible redox couples (EtV2+/EtV+, EtV+/EtV0) is demonstrated to well match the redox chemistry of sulfur species, in terms of accelerating the electron transfer in S8 reduction, Li2S nucleation and the Li2S oxidation. When coupling with a functionalized separator with electronegative &#8208;SO3Li groups, a synergetic chemistry is established to ensure the substantial inhibition of the shuttle effect and the acceleration of charge transfer. As a result, the activation energies during sulfur species conversion (S8&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;Li2S/Li2S2&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;S8) are decreased, especially for Li2S nucleation step. The correspond lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries achieve a high specific capacity of 1006.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.1&#8197;C; sulfur loading of 5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2; E/S ratios of 6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1), and an outstanding cycling stability. This study provides a paradigm of solving complex problems via multifunctional molecule engineering and strategic cooperation towards Li&#8722;S batteries and other battery communities.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reinforced &#8220;Microglia Energy Modulator&#8221; for Synergistic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Clearance in Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mutually reinforcing microglia energy modulator is developed by repurposing lonidamine and hollow mesoporous Prussian blue for synergistic clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's disease. The modulator improves microglial phagocytic function, decreases amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits, mitigates neuroinflammation, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease mouse model.







Abstract
Microglial phagocytosis is a highly energy&#8208;consuming process that plays critical roles in clearing neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, microglial metabolism is defective overall in AD, thereby undermining microglial phagocytic functions. Herein, we repurpose the existing antineoplastic drug lonidamine (LND) conjugated with hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) as a &#8220;microglial energy modulator&#8221; (termed LND@HMPB&#8208;T7) for safe and synergistic A&#946; clearance. The modified blood&#8211;brain barrier penetrating heptapeptide (T7) enables efficient transport of LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 to the AD brain. LND in LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could fuel A&#946; phagocytosis by stimulating microglial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, whereas HMPB with catalase and superoxide dismutase&#8208;mimicking activities substantially alleviates the mitochondrial side effects commonly associated with LND and thus further enhances ATP production. The synergism of LND and nanozyme affords a high microglial A&#946; clearance efficacy without triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. In vivo experiments ascertain that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could synergistically promote phagocytic clearance of A&#946;, relieve neuroinflammation and ameliorate cognitive function in AD mice. These findings indicate that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 holds tremendous clinical potential as a repurposed drug for AD treatment.

LND in LND@HMPB-T7 could fuel A&#946; phagocytosis by stimulating microglial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, whereas HMPB with catalase and superoxide dismutase-mimicking activities substantially alleviates the mitochondrial side effects commonly associated with LND and thus further enhances ATP production. The synergism of LND and nanozyme affords a high microglial A&#946; clearance efficacy without triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. In vivo experiments ascertain that LND@HMPB-T7 could synergistically promote phagocytic clearance of A&#946;, relieve neuroinflammation and ameliorate cognitive function in AD mice. These findings indicate that LND@HMPB-T7 holds tremendous clinical potential as a repurposed drug for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mirror&#8208;Image Random Nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) Technology Yields Highly Stable and Selective Macrocyclic Peptide Inhibitors for Matrix Metallopeptidase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mirror&#8208;image RaPID (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology was developed for the discovery of innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides. Metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. Using MI&#8208;RaPID technology, we identified a highly selective and stable macrocyclic peptide, which consists of D&#8208;amino acids, one &#946;&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond, and inhibited MMP7 with an IC50 of 90&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Matrix metallopeptidase&#8197;7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer metastasis and progression, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. However, the development of selective MMP7 inhibitors is challenging due to the conservation of active sites across various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we have developed mirror&#8208;image random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology to discover innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides that specifically bind to and inhibit human MMP7. One identified macrocyclic peptide against D&#8208;MMP7, termed D20, was synthesized in its mirror&#8208;image form, D&#8217;20, consisting of 12 D&#8208;amino acids, one cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond. Notably, it potently inhibited MMP7 with an IC50 value of 90&#8197;nM, and showed excellent selectivity over other MMPs with similar substrate specificity. Moreover, D&#8217;20 inhibited the migration of pancreatic cell line CFPAC&#8208;1, but had no effect on the cell proliferation and viability. D&#8217;20 exhibited excellent stability in human serum, as well as in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. This study highlights that MI&#8208;RaPID technology can serve as a powerful tool to develop in vivo stable macrocyclic peptides for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Magnetocapacitance Spanning 97K Hysteresis in Molecular Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB=(2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) possess superior magnetocapacitance and a record thermal hysteresis width of 97&#8197;K. The magnetocapacitance comes from their intrinsic nature, rather than the composite results found in inorganic materials. Meanwhile, this is still the first time so far to study magnetocapacitance in molecule&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Magnetic capacitor, as a new type of device, has broad application prospects in fields such as magnetic field sensing, magnetic storage, magnetic field control, power electronics and so on. Traditional magnetic capacitors are mostly assembled by magnetic and capacitive materials. Magnetic capacitor made of a single material with intrinsic properties is very rare. This intrinsic property is magnetocapacitance (MC). The studies on MC effect have mainly focused on metal oxides so far. No study was reported in molecular materials. Herein, two complexes: (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB=(2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) are reported. There exist strong H&#8722;Br and Br&#8722;Br interactions and other weak interactions in complex 2, so the phase transition energy barrier is high, resulting in the widest thermal hysteresis loop on a molecular level to date. Furthermore, complexes 1 and 2 show large MC parameters of 0.247 and 1.614, respectively, which is the first time to observe MC effect in molecular material.

         <title>Subtle Modifications in Interface Configurations of Iron/Cobalt Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts Determine Molecular CO2 Reduction Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strain has an adverse or conducive effect on catalytic activity. Strained cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine improves *CO binding for subsequent hydrogenation, attaining methanol Faradaic efficiency up to 52&#8201;%. However, strained iron phthalocyanine exacerbates *CO poisoning, leading to inferior CO production. We proposed *CO binding strength as an indicator for activity prediction.







Abstract
Strain engineering has emerged as a powerful approach in steering material properties. However, the mechanism and potential limitations remain poorly understood. Here we report that subtle changes in molecular configurations can profoundly affect, conducively or adversely, the catalytic selectivity and product turnover frequencies (TOFs) of CO2 reduction reaction. Specifically, introducing molecular curvature in cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine improves the multielectron reduction activity by favorable *CO hydrogenation, attaining methanol Faradaic efficiency up to 52&#8201;%. In stark contrast, strained iron phthalocyanine exacerbates *CO poisoning, leading to decreased TOFCO by &gt;50&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;VRHE and a rapid current decay. The uniform dispersion is crucial for optimizing electron transfer, while activity is distinctly sensitive to the local atomic environment around the active sites. Specifically, local strain either enhances binding to intermediates or poisons the catalytic sites. Our comprehensive analysis elucidates the intricate relationship between molecular structure and activities, offering insights into designing efficient heterogeneous molecular interfaces.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;small Metallic Nickel Nanoparticles on Dealuminated Zeolite for Active and Durable Catalytic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step aging method for preparing ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles on dealuminated Beta zeolite has been developed. These nanoparticles show high performance in catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane into hydrogen and benzene.







Abstract
Each step in the catalyst synthesis process plays an important role in tuning the catalyst structures. For zeolite&#8208;supported nickel catalysts, we found the conventional calcination&#8208;reduction method typically leads to the formation of large nickel particles, but a pre&#8208;aging in hydrogen or nitrogen at a low temperature prior to final reduction can result in ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles in a metallic state. This pre&#8208;aging treatment facilitates the interaction between Ni2+ cations and silanol nests on zeolite before the decomposition of the metal salt, leading to the formation of nanoparticles with an average diameter of ~1.2&#8197;nm. In contrast, the pre&#8208;calcination in oxygen caused the Ni2+ aggregation before the decomposition of the metal salt precursor, yielding nickel nanoparticles larger than 5&#8197;nm. Given the structure sensitivity of nickel in cyclohexane dehydrogenation for hydrogen production, the ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles exhibited significantly enhanced activity and durability compared to previous nickel catalysts.

         <title>Inside Cover: Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols in water was achieved by Wolfgang Kroutil, Pawe&#322; Borowiecki, and co&#8208;workers (e202420133). The cover image illustrates the cooperative action of an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase (bottom left), which mediates racemization via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing mechanism (indicated by the swirl), and an acyltransferase (bottom right) that enables enantioselective acylation. This organic&#8208;solvent&#8208; and metal&#8208;free DKR offers a novel approach for the deracemization of sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous system using exclusively biocatalysts. The cover was designed by Verena Resch.

         <dc:description>
Electrodeposition of sodium metal in an anode&#8208;free battery can be dendritic. The tree at the center of the cover image represents a single crystalline dendrite, branched and complex in its morphology, originating at the support and growing towards the cathode. Its multicolor leaves are the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that cover the metal surface. The SEI is a complex mosaic containing crystalline sodium fluoride, sodium hydride and sodium hydroxide, as well as organic constituents. Details of this study are reported by David Mitlin, Yu&#8208;chen Karen Chen&#8208;Wiegart et al. in their Research Article (e202412550).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Room&#8208;temperature Magnetocapacitance Spanning 97K Hysteresis in Molecular Material (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetocapacitance has been studied for the first time in molecular complexes. The weak interaction between cations and anions in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials triggers their structural thermal phase transition. The distinguished Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions in high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases lead to different magnetoelectric coupling, as reported by Zhao&#8208;Bo Hu, Yan Peng, Jing Ma, You Song et al. in their Research Article (e202416380).

         <title>Back Cover: Air&#8208;Mediated Biomimetic Synthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoate with C4 Diol (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the biomimetic synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) using C4 diol and air, catalyzed by a synergistic catalyst, was presented by Qiuquan Cai and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202417660). The resulting PHA can reversibly convert back to a small&#8208;molecule monomer in the form of a five&#8208;membered ring, demonstrating excellent ecological sustainability. This study highlights the potential for large&#8208;scale synthesis of high&#8208;value PHAs from diverse non&#8208;grain&#8208;based diols.

In their Communication (e202418228), Hao Li and co&#8208;workers reveal an exciting contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn displays opposite behaviors. This response results in a fascinating, opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn. Most importantly, we propose that distinct strategies are necessary for designing catalysts using single&#8208;atom versus polyatomic metal catalysts.

         <dc:description>
An increasing need for the miniaturization of optoelectronic devices or machines has become evident as we are entering the post&#8208;Moore era. One bold conceit is that chemically synthesized nanoparticles (NP) can function as nanodevices or nanomachines. In their Research Article (e202420931), Zhikun Wu, Jun Yang, Nan Xia et al. demonstrate the feasibility by reporting a novel nanocluster with multileveled capacitor&#8208;like character, which is identified by a Cd(II) transport from the outershell to the innermost position after charged with NaBH4, as well as some other ways such as NPA charge distribution, voltammetry and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. An intra&#8208;NP anti&#8208;galvanic reduction was found after the migrating of charge carrier.

Synthetic biomolecular condensates are appealing candidates to replicate key features and functions of intracellular membrane&#8208;less organelles. Their dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provides crucial insights into the regulation of fundamental cell processes. Via integration with ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, synthetic biomolecular condensates offer innovative solutions for engineering active materials with sophisticated functions.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation towards the formation of synthetic coacervate droplets represents a rapidly advancing frontier in the fields of synthetic biology, material science, and biomedicine. These artificial constructures mimic the biophysical principles and dynamic features of natural biomolecular condensates that are pivotal for cellular regulation and organization. Via adapting biological concepts, synthetic condensates with dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provide crucial insights into the fundamental cell processes and regulation of complex biological pathways. They are increasingly designed with the ability to display more complex and ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, which offer innovative solutions for cytomimetic modeling and engineering active materials with sophisticated functions. In this minireview, we highlight recent advancements in the design and construction of synthetic coacervate droplets; including their biomimicry structure and organization to replicate life&#8208;like properties and behaviors, and the dynamic control towards engineering active coacervates. Moreover, we highlight the unique applications of synthetic coacervates as catalytic centers and promising delivery vehicles, so that these biomimicry assemblies can be translated into practical applications.

         <title>Leveraging Iron in the Electrolyte to Improve Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled introduction of iron ions into the electrolyte, coupled with a suitable host material to facilitate in situ iron deposition, opens new strategies for creating highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces to continuously catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction at a steady rate, thereby breaking the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and material stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal technology for storing intermittent electricity from renewable sources into hydrogen fuel. However, its overall energy efficiency is impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In the quest to design high&#8208;performance anode catalysts for driving the OER under non&#8208;acidic conditions, iron (Fe) has emerged as a crucial element. Although the profound impact of adventitious electrolyte Fen+ species on OER catalysis had been reported forty years ago, recent interest in tailoring the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface has spurred studies on the controlled introduction of Fe ions into the electrolyte to improve OER performance. During the catalytic process, scenarios where the rate of Fen+ deposition on a specific host material outruns that of dissolution pave the way for establishing highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces for long&#8208;term steady operation. This review systematically summarizes recent endeavors devoted to elucidating the behaviors of in situ Fe(aq.) incorporation, the role of incorporated Fe sites in the OER, and critical factors influencing the interplay between the electrode surface and Fe ions in the electrolyte environment. Finally, unexplored issues related to comprehensively understanding and leveraging the dynamic exchange of Fen+ at the interface for improved OER catalysis are summarized.

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Reticular Frameworks To Govern Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in the development of hybrid biocatalysts by integrating enzymes with reticular frameworks, with specific emphasis on how framework architecture and host&#8208;guest interactions influence bioreactivity. Three key regulatory mechanisms are highlighted: 1) guiding mass transfer through pore structures, 2) regulating enzyme conformation via interfacial interactions, and 3) enabling photoactivated biocatalysis by leveraging photoactive reticular frameworks.







Abstract
Integrating enzymes with reticular frameworks offers promising avenues for access to functionally tailorable biocatalysis. This Minireview explores recent advances in enzyme&#8208;reticular framework hybrid biocomposites, focusing on the utilization of porous reticular frameworks, including metal&#8208;organic frameworks, covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, to regulate the reactivity of an enzyme encapsulated inside mainly by pore infiltration and in situ encapsulation strategies. We highlight how pore engineering and host&#8208;guest interfacial interactions within reticular frameworks create tailored microenvironments that substantially impact the mass transfer and enzyme conformation, leading to biocatalytic rate enhancement, or imparting enzymes with non&#8208;native biocatalytic functions, including substrate selectivity and new activity. Additionally, the feasibility of leveraging the photothermal effect of a framework to optimize the local reaction temperature and photoelectric effect to elicit diverse photoenzyme&#8208;coupled reactions is also summarized in detail, which can expand the functional repertoire of biocatalytic transformations under light irradiation. This Minireview underscores the potential of reticular frameworks as tunable and reliable platforms to govern biocatalysis, offering pathways for engineering sustainable, efficient, and selective biocatalytic reactors in pharmaceutical, environmental, and energy&#8208;related applications.

Photocatalysis seeing red! A copper&#8208;based complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4 exhibits two&#8208;photon upconversion promoting energy transfer photocatalysis enabling oxidative dimerization of benzylic amines, sulfide oxidation, phosphine oxidation, boronic acid oxidation and atom&#8208;transfer radical addition.







Abstract
Photocatalysis mediated by low energy light wavelengths has potential to enable safer, sustainable synthetic methods. A phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligand bathocupSani, with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross section was used to construct a heteroleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)(DPEPhos)]BF4 and a homoleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4. The ligand and the respective homoleptic complex with copper exhibit two&#8208;photon upconversion with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.2&#8197;eV using red light. The complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4 promoted energy transfer photocatalysis enabling oxidative dimerization of benzylic amines, sulfide oxidation, phosphine oxidation, boronic acid oxidation and atom&#8208;transfer radical addition.

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Showing an Ion&#8208;Triggered Chiroptical Switching Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight phenyl groups were fused into carbazole to give a novel &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicene. Boron incorporation furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene showing an ion&#8208;triggered chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species with the change in the color and glum values.







Abstract
Intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)carbazole provided a bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole, while that of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;diphenylcarbazole afforded a bis(quaterphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole. Borylation of the latter furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene binding a fluoride anion via a structural change from the three&#8208;coordinate boron to the four&#8208;coordinate boron. The anionic charge derived from the fluoride anion is stabilized over the expanded &#960;&#8208;framework, which leads to the high binding constant (Ka) of 1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The four&#8208;coordinate boron species was converted back to the parent three&#8208;coordinate boron species with Ag+, and the chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species has been achieved via the ion recognition with the change in the color and glum values.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling of 3,6-bis(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl-2&#8217;-yl)carbazole provided a bis(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl)-fused carbazole, while that of 3,6-bis(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl-2&#8217;-yl)-1,8-diphenylcarbazole afforded a bis(quaterphenyl)-fused carbazole. Borylation of the latter furnished a B,N-embedded helical nanographene binding a fluoride anion via a structural change from the three-coordinate boron to the four-coordinate boron. The anionic charge derived from the fluoride anion is stabilized over the expanded &#960;-framework, which leads to the high binding constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The four-coordinate boron species was converted back to the parent three-coordinate boron species with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the chiroptical switch between the three-coordinate boron and four-coordinate boron species has been achieved via the ion recognition with the change in the color and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of the Smallest Three&#8208;Dimensional Neutral Boron Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoionization efficiency spectrum of B9 was measured by using VUV free electron laser. B9 was characterized to be the smallest 3D neutral boron cluster with a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of B9&#8208;. A single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond between the capping atoms is found to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9.







Abstract
Despite major progress in the investigation of boron cluster anions, direct experimental study of neutral boron clusters remains a significant challenge because of the difficulty in size selection. Here we report a size&#8208;specific study of the neutral B9 cluster using threshold photoionization with a tunable vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser. The ionization potential of B9 is measured to be 8.45&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and it is found to have a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of the B9&#8208; anionic cluster. Chemical bonding analyses reveal superior stability of the bipyramidal structure arising from delocalized &#963; and &#960; bonding interactions within the B7 ring and between the B7 ring and the capping atoms. Photoionization of B9 breaks the single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms, which undergo off&#8208;axis distortion to enhance interactions with the B7 ring in the singlet ground state of B9+. The single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms appears to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9. This work opens avenues for direct size&#8208;dependent experimental studies of a large variety of neutral boron clusters to explore the stepwise development of network structures.

         <title>Remote Hydrogen Bonding between Ligand and Substrate Accelerates C&#8211;H Bond Activation and Enables Switchable Site Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spirobipyridine ligand bearing a hydroxy group recognizes pyridine and quinoline substrates through hydrogen bonding, and in combination with an iridium catalyst enables C&#8722;H borylation with site selectivity that can be switched by changing the position of the hydroxy group on the ligand. The catalyst also accelerates the reaction, overrides steric bias, and selectively recognizes the pyridine substrate in a manner reminiscent of enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed selective and efficient activation of an inert C&#8722;H bond in an organic substrate is of importance for the development of streamlined synthetic methodologies. An attractive approach is the design of a metal catalyst capable of recognizing an organic substrate through noncovalent interactions to control reactivity and selectivity. We report here a spirobipyridine ligand that bears a hydroxy group which recognizes pyridine and quinoline substrates through hydrogen bonding, and in combination with an iridium catalyst enables site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation. The site selectivity can be switched by simply changing the position of the hydroxy group on the ligand. The catalyst also accelerates the reactions, overrides steric bias, and selectively recognizes a pyridine substrate in the presence of other hydrogen bond acceptors. These features are reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis and suggest that judicious design of the recognition group on the ligand can become a general strategy to selectively and efficiently functionalize organic substrates.

         <title>Accessing Azetidines through Magnesium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Group Transfer from Iminoiodinane to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a magnesium&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. This protocol operates under mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and showcases excellent chemoselectivity, along with broad functional group tolerance. We report for the first time that challenging alkyl donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes can undergo ring expansion leading to aliphatic azetidines without relying on external oxidants or precious transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium (Mg)&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.

         <title>Sprayed Aqueous Microdroplets for Spontaneous Synthesis of Functional Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile solution spray method is developed for spontaneous synthesis of microgels without confined emulsion, additional initiators/catalysts and deoxygenation. The strategy is applicable to a variety of monomers and enables the synthesis of microgels with tunable chemical structures and variable sizes. Moreover, this strategy allows the in&#8197;situ encapsulation of biologics into microgels, enabling enzyme catalysis and controlled drug release.







Abstract
The development of sustainable synthesis route to produce functional and bioactive polymer colloids has attracted much attention. Most strategies are based on the polymerization of monomers or crosslinking of prepolymers by enzyme&#8208; or cell&#8208;mediated reactions or specific catalysts in confined emulsions. Herein, a facile solution spray method was developed for spontaneous synthesis of microgels without use of confined emulsion, additional initiators/catalysts and deoxygenation, which addresses the challenges in traditional microgel synthesis. The polarization of air&#8208;water interface of the microdroplets can spontaneously split hydroxide ions in water to produce hydroxyl radicals, thereby initiating polymerization and crosslinking in air environment. This synthesis strategy is applicable to a variety of monomers and enables the fabrication of microgels with tunable chemical structures and variable sizes. Importantly, the synthesis route also allows for the preparation of enzyme&#8208; or drug&#8208;loaded microgels via the in&#8197;situ encapsulation, which also display high enzymatic activity and stimuli&#8208;triggered drug release. Therefore, this work not only is of great significance to macromolecular science and microdroplet chemistry, but also may bring new insights into cellular biochemistry and even prebiotic chemistry due to the prevalence of microdroplets in the environment.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of ~1&#8197;nm Multilevel Capacitor&#8208;like Particles with Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

The multilevel capacitor&#8208;like character of a novel Au44Cd20 nanoparticle (NP) is identified by NPA charge calculations, charge carrier transport, voltammetry and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Intra&#8208;NP anti&#8208;galvanic reduction leads to the unanticipated innermost Cd occupation in the cannula&#8208;like Au&#8722;Cd nanoclusters with Au&#8722;Cd segregation.







Abstract
Can the chemically synthesized nanoparticles act as nanodevices or nanomachines? Herein, we demonstrated this feasibility. A novel nanocluster (ultrasmall nanoparticle) [Au44Cd20(m&#8208;MBT)40][N(C8H17)4]2 (Au44Cd20 in short, m&#8208;MBTH: m&#8208;methylbenzenethiol) obtained via developing a synthesis method has a cannula&#8208;like structure of the outer shell and an internal sleeve, revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Natural population analysis (NPA) charge calculations, charge carrier transport of Au44Cd20 (during which an intra&#8208;nanocluster anti&#8208;galvanic reaction was observed) after unneutral charging using NaBH4 as well as voltammetry proved the capacitor&#8208;like character of Au44Cd20. The subsidiary capacitor&#8208;like character of the outer shell of Au44Cd20 was further probed via NPA charge calculations and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Thus, this study predicts a new era of engineering metal nanoparticles for realizing atomically precise ultrasmall nanodevices and nanomachines.

         <title>An sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fusing Lipid Droplets and Engineered Macrophage Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages, promoting their antitumor activation. The mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induces lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. The intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited CT26 tumor progression.







Abstract
Engineered immune cell therapy has proven to be a transformative cancer treatment despite the challenges of its prohibitive costs and manufacturing complexity. In this study, we propose a concise &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages. Because of the integration of hydrophobic alkyl chains and &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, the mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induced lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, thus promoting their antitumor classical activation. Intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited tumor progression. These results represent the first report of room&#8208;temperature synthesis of sp2C&#8208;conjugated COFs for engineered immune cell therapy, providing a new perspective for the development of therapeutic immune cells via organelle manipulation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Cascade Nanosystems for Spatiotemporally Controlled Gene&#8208;Silencing and Gas Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;triggered cascade effect system is developed to achieve precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This strategy harnesses the power of NIR&#8208;induced NO release to orchestrate the relocation of APE1, thereby achieving enhanced efficiency and spatiotemporal controllability of gene silencing.







Abstract
Despite the tremendous potential of DNAzymes in gene therapy, achieving gene regulation with spatiotemporal precision and satisfactory efficacy remains a key challenge. Herein, we developed a near&#8208;infrared light (NIR)&#8208;triggered cascade effect system that enables precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This nanoplatform was constructed using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme, a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The UCNPs act as light converters, facilitating the precursor to produce NO under NIR light irradiation, while the generated NO not only participates directly in gas therapy but also induces the upregulation of cytoplasmic APE1 level, resulting in enhanced DNAzyme activation and spatially controlled gene silencing. By leveraging this mechanism, cascade effects mediated gas&#8208;gene synergistic therapy is achieved through the combination of NIR light&#8208;controlled NO release and APE1&#8208;activatable gene therapy. We demonstrated that this nanoplatform enables enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy represents a critical step forward in the quest for highly targeted and efficient cancer treatments.

         <title>The Electrochemical Iodination of Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
YES WE CAN&#8212;the electrochemical iodination of electron&#8208;deficient arenes under Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions in a divided cell is realized when Bu4NI as pre&#8208;reagent is oxidised at the anode and catalytic amounts of Bu4NCl are present for the generation of [I2Cl]+ as active iodinating agent. The iodination is capable to convert a wide range of interesting halogenated arenes, aromatic aldehydes, benzoic acids, benzoates, aryl nitriles, aryl ketones and nitrobenzene derivatives into their corresponding iodinated products.







Abstract
The iodination of electron&#8208;deficient arenes and heteroarenes is a long&#8208;standing problem in organic synthesis. Herein we describe the electrochemical iodination in nitromethane with Bu4NI as iodine source and supporting electrolyte under Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions in the presence of small amounts of chloride anions. The electrochemically generated reagent could be applied for the iodination of halogenated arenes, aromatic aldehydes, acids, esters, ketones, as well as nitroarenes to afford the products in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Highly Selective Construction of Unique Cyclic [4]Catenanes Induced by Multiple Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented cyclic [4]catenanes, 1 and 2, were prepared based on the selection of naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based Cp*Rh/Ir building blocks E1/E2 (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) and diimidazole ligand L1. 1, exhibiting a broad&#8208;band absorption in UV/Vis to NIR regions and a remarkable photothermal conversion was used to build new 1 membrane. The solar power&#8208;induced water steam generation performance of 1 membrane could reach a value of 2.37&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The synthesis of high&#8208;ordered mechanically interlocked supramolecular structures is an extremely challenging topic. Only two linear [4]catenanes have been reported so far and there is no defined strategy to obtain cyclic [4]catenane. Herein, two unprecedented cyclic [4]catenanes, 1 and 2, were prepared in high yields. The syntheses rely on the strategic selection of naphthalenediimide (NDI) based Cp*Rh/Ir building blocks E1/E2 (Cp*=pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) and nonlinear diimidazole ligand precursor L1, exhibiting large conjugate plane, appropriate coordination angles, and freely rotating imidazole units, thereby enabling multiple &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions to maintain the supramolecular structures. The use of other Cp*Rh building blocks E3, E4 or E5 featuring slightly shorter metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal distances than E1/E2 and different chemical properties led to the formation of a complex 3 and two metallamacrocycles 4 or 5, respectively. The structures of these assemblies were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS and NMR spectroscopy. Complex 1, exhibiting a broad&#8208;band absorption in the UV/Vis to NIR regions and a remarkable photothermal conversion was thereafter used to build the new 1 membrane. The solar power&#8208;induced water steam generation performance of 1 membrane was investigated, reaching a value of 2.37&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, making it suitable for collection of fresh water via desalination and wastewater.

Behind bioorthogonal chemistry: micelles constructed with amphiphiles bearing bioorthogonal reactants allowed non&#8208;bioorthogonal chemistry in a confined environment. Application of this strategy was made with the synthesis of an FDA&#8208;approved anticancer drug inside living cells. Apart from this application, this strategy could represent a change of paradigm, allowing an extension of the concept of bioorthogonal chemistry.







Abstract
The development of innovative strategies enabling chemical reactions in living systems is of great interest for exploring and manipulating biological processes. Herein, we present a pioneering approach based on both bioorthogonal and confined chemistry for intracellular drug synthesis. Exploiting a click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction, we engineered nanoparticles capable of synthesizing drugs within cellular environments through bioorthogonal reactions with cyclooctynes. Proof of concept experiments showed that this new approach could be successfully applied to the synthesis of the FDA&#8208;approved Sorafenib within cancer cells. The integration of bioorthogonal and confined chemistry not only offers exciting prospects for advancing therapeutic strategies but also opens up new avenues for exploring non&#8208;natural reactions within living systems. This innovative approach represents a fundamental extension of the biorthogonal chemistry concept and holds great promise for pioneering developments in therapeutic applications.

         <title>Isoreticular Tolerance and Phase Selection in the Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation and Electrocatalytic OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than just pushing and squeezing the pore space, the core of ligands can communicate with each other and self&#8208;organize to determine the ultimate path of MOF crystallization.







Abstract
Although metal&#8211;organic frameworks are coordination&#8208;driven assemblies, the structural prediction and design using metal&#8208;ligand interactions can be unreliable due to other competing interactions. Leveraging non&#8208;coordination interactions to develop porous assemblies could enable new materials and applications. Here, we use a multi&#8208;module MOF system to explore important and pervasive impact of ligand&#8208;ligand interactions on metal&#8208;ligand as well as ligand&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly process. It is found that ligand&#8208;ligand interactions play critical roles on the scope or breakdown of isoreticular chemistry. With cooperative di&#8208; and tri&#8208;topic ligands, a family of Ni&#8208;MOFs has been synthesized in various structure types including partitioned MIL&#8208;88&#8208;acs (pacs), interrupted pacs (i&#8208;pacs), and UMCM&#8208;1&#8208;muo. A new type of isoreticular chemistry on the muo platform is established between two drastically different chemical systems. The gas sorption and electrocatalytic studies were performed that reveal excellent performance such as high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 21.8 and high C2H2 uptake capacity of 114.5&#8197;cm3/g at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar.

         <title>Artificial Metalloenzymes with Two Catalytic Cofactors for Tandem Abiotic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential incorporation of an organic photocatalytic cofactor and a metal cofactor into streptavidin leads to artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that catalyze tandem abiotic transformations such as enantioselective formal C&#8722;H hydroxylation and photooxidation&#8208;Michael addition. This work introduces a programmable approach for the construction of ArMs that can catalyze tandem abiotic reactions.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) enable the integration of abiotic cofactors within a native protein scaffold, allowing for non&#8208;natural catalytic activities. Previous ArMs, however, have primarily relied on single cofactor systems, limiting them to only one catalytic function. Here we present an approach to construct ArMs embedding two catalytic cofactors based on the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology. By incorporating multiple catalytic cofactors into the four binding sites of streptavidin, we engineered programmable ArMs for tandem abiotic transformations including an enantioselective formal C&#8722;H hydroxylation and a photooxidation&#8208;Michael addition. This work thus outlines a promising strategy for the development of ArMs embedding multiple cofactors.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Ammonia Synthesis via a Proton&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of photo&#8208;driven N2 reduction to NH3 via a proton&#8208;mediated photoelecrochemical device is proposed and achieved. This strategy with a two&#8208;electrode cell system uses a covalent organic framework (COF) anode with Au single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and &#8722;OH redox functions, which enables protons to be stored and transferred to catalytic sites. It achieved proton promoted N2 reduction reaction and the ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
N2 reduction reaction (NRR) by light is an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis technology. However, it faces significant challenges, including high energy barriers of N2 activation and unclear catalytic active sites. Herein, we propose a strategy of photo&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis via a proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device. We used redox&#8208;catalysis covalent organic framework (COF), with a redox site (&#8722;C=O) for H+ reversible storage and a catalytic site (porphyrin Au) for NRR. In the proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device, the COF can successfully store e&#8722; and H+ generated by hydrogen oxidation reaction, forming COF&#8722;H. Then, these stored e&#8722; and H+ can be used for photo&#8208;driven NRR (108.97&#8197;umol&#8201;g&#8722;1) under low proton concentration promoted by the H&#8208;bond network formed between &#8722;OH in COF&#8722;H and N2 on Au, which enabled N2 hydrogenation and NH3 production, establishing basis for advancing artificial photosynthesis and enhancing ammonia synthesis technology.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy of photo-driven N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; via a proton-mediated photoelecrochemical device is proposed and achieved. This strategy with a two-electrode cell system uses a covalent organic framework (COF) anode with Au single-atom catalytic sites and &#8722;OH redox functions, which enables protons to be stored and transferred to catalytic sites. It achieved proton promoted N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction and the ammonia synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (NRR) by light is an energy-saving and sustainable ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis technology. However, it faces significant challenges, including high energy barriers of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and unclear catalytic active sites. Herein, we propose a strategy of photo-driven ammonia synthesis via a proton-mediated photoelectrochemical device. We used redox-catalysis covalent organic framework (COF), with a redox site (&#8722;C=O) for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reversible storage and a catalytic site (porphyrin Au) for NRR. In the proton-mediated photoelectrochemical device, the COF can successfully store e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generated by hydrogen oxidation reaction, forming COF&#8722;H. Then, these stored e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can be used for photo-driven NRR (108.97&#8197;umol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) under low proton concentration promoted by the H-bond network formed between &#8722;OH in COF&#8722;H and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Au, which enabled N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production, establishing basis for advancing artificial photosynthesis and enhancing ammonia synthesis technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Amides by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Internal Alkenes Directed by an Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unactivated internal alkenes were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to control the regioselectivity to over 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and the enantioselectivity to up to 97&#8201;% ee. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position, delivering valuable enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.







Abstract
Catalytic regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroamination of less activated internal alkenes presents a challenge to synthetic chemists due to their low reactivity and the difficulty in simultaneously controlling regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Here, we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of internal alkenes directed by an amide. The amide group on the alkene effectively directs the catalyst to overcome the low reactivity and control the regioselectivity and the enantiotopic face selection. Phthalimide serves as the amination agent, which could be readily removed to afford a primary amine. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position with up to 97&#8201;% ee, delivering valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.

         <title>A Highly Biocompatible Polyoxotungstate with Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Activity for Potent Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyoxotungstate has been made and found to show excellent solubility, stability, and biocompatibility in aqueous solutions and physiological conditions. Remarkably, it can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, and thus exhibit high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells. Moreover, it exhibits excellent antitumor efficacy with good biosafety against melanoma growth in vivo. This makes it a promising candidate as a cancer chemodynamic therapy agent







Abstract
Integrating Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy has significantly promoted the development of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs), with their reversible redox properties, exhibit promising potential in developing outstanding CDT drugs by exploring their Fenton&#8208;like catalytic reactivity in tumor environments. However, such research is still in its infancy due to the challenges of acquiring POMs that are both easily prepared and possess ideal therapeutic effects, physiological solubility, biocompatibility and safety. In this work, we report the synthesis of a new crystalline antimonotungstate {Dy2Sb2W7O23(OH)(DMF)2(SbW9O33)2} (1, DMF=N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide) with gram&#8208;scale high yield via a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal reaction. 1 exhibits not only a soluble and water&#8208;stable POM nanocluster, but also excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyl radical&#8208;generating Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Further biomedical studies reveal that 1 can trigger cell apoptosis and promote lipid peroxidation, exhibiting high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells with an IC50 value of 4.75&#8197;&#956;M. Especially, 1 can inhibit melanoma growth in vivo with favorable biosafety, achieving a 5.2&#8208;fold reduction in tumor volume and a weight loss of 76.0&#8201;% at the dose of 70&#8197;&#956;g/kg. This research not only demonstrates the immense potential of antimonotungstates in CDT drug development for the first time but also provides new insights and directions for the development of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>DNA Mimic Foldamer Recognition of a Chromosomal Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomolecular mimics are intended to outperform their natural counterparts. However, B&#8208;DNA surface mimicry to target DNA&#8208;binding proteins has long remained underdeveloped. We have introduced helical aromatic foldamers mimicking the shape and charge distribution of B&#8208;DNA that bind to some DNA&#8208;binding proteins better than DNA itself. Taking the chromosomal protein Sac7d as a model, we now provide the first structural insights into DNA mimic foldamer&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers bearing anionic side chains that mimic the overall shape and charge surface distribution of DNA were synthesized. Their interactions with chromosomal protein Sac7d, a non&#8208;sequence&#8208;selective DNA&#8208;binder that kinks DNA, were investigated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), Circular Dichroism spectroscopy (CD), melting curve analysis, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), as well as by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The foldamers were shown to bind to Sac7d better than a DNA duplex of comparable length. The interaction is diastereoselective and takes place at the DNA binding site. Crystallography revealed that the DNA mimic foldamers have a binding mode of their own and that they can bind to Sac7d without being kinked.

         <title>Unprecedented Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Birefringence in Fluorides Constructed from Linear &#960;&#8208;Group Anisotropic Structure Building Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers the anisotropic structural building unit that encompasses diverse chemical bonds (ABUCB) concept with a novel linear &#960; group to construct the compound Na[BF2(CN)2], which exhibits the record&#8208;high birefringence among deep ultraviolet materials.







Abstract
Advancing laser technologies requires maximizing the anisotropy of crystalline media and overcoming current birefringence limitations. We introduce the strategy of linear &#960; group anisotropic structure building units (ABUCB), leading to an unprecedented large birefringence (&#916;n), a record&#8208;high &#916;nobv. of 0.152 in sodium bis(dicyanoborato)fluoride (Na[BF2(CN)2]), the highest reported among deep ultraviolet (DUV) materials. This value is 35&#8201;% greater than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;BBO and 1167&#8201;% greater than MgF2. Density functional theory analyses suggest that the linear &#960; group enhances bulk optical anisotropy and ensures a shorter DUV absorption edge. These results establish Na[BF2(CN)2] as a groundbreaking DUV birefringent material and open new avenues for research into extending &#960; groups and exploring additional possibilities.

This value is 35&#8201;% greater than state-of-the-art &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-BBO and 1167&#8201;% greater than MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Density functional theory analyses suggest that the linear &#960; group enhances bulk optical anisotropy and ensures a shorter DUV absorption edge. These results establish Na[BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] as a groundbreaking DUV birefringent material and open new avenues for research into extending &#960; groups and exploring additional possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing&#8208;Based Methods for the Construction of Quaternary Stereocentres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the hydrogen borrowing manifold to access &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketones through a tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation&#8208;cyclisation cascade is presented. This new application of the methodology results in the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered carbocycles with a high degree of diastereoselectivity. Interestingly, benzylic alcohol substrates behaved anomalously and eliminated sulfinate in&#8197;situ to give a set of rearranged &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketone products.







Abstract
Compounds containing quaternary stereocentres are a valuable motif in biologically active compounds. Herein we present our strategy to utilise the hydrogen borrowing manifold to access &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketones via a tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation&#8208;cyclisation cascade. This new application of the methodology results in the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered carbocycles with a high degree of diastereoselectivity. Interestingly, benzylic alcohol substrates behaved anomalously and eliminated sulfinate in&#8197;situ to give a set of rearranged &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketone products.

         <title>Building Three&#8208;Dimensional Complexity by Intramolecular 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cation&#8722;Diene (4+3) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [4&#960;+2&#960;] cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations with 1,3&#8208;dienes was achieved. This transformation utilized various 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates (1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;EMCCs) as substrates, providing rapid access to diverse seven&#8208;membered 3D frameworks. By employing this cycloaddition as a key step, the total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;aphanamol I and (&#177;)&#8208;mint ketone was demonstrated.







Abstract
Reliable methods for rapidly constructing C(sp3)&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional polycycles are in high demand for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although there are various mature systems for synthesizing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered polycycles, a catalytic platform for accessing diverse cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds is lacking. Herein, we describe a method for copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 2&#8208;aminoallyl cation&#8722;diene (4+3) cycloaddition reactions. By using 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates as substrates, we were able to construct various cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds, which are present in many bioactive molecules. The cycloaddition products were rich in functionality that could undergo various chemical transformations. The synthetic utility of the method was illustrated by total synthesis of the natural products (&#177;)&#8208;mint ketone and (&#177;)&#8208;aphanamol I. Mechanistic studies indicated that the cycloadditions proceed by a concerted [4&#960;+2&#960;] mechanism and that an endo&#8208;selective pathway is favored.

         <title>Reprocessable and Recyclable Materials for 3D Printing via Reversible Thia&#8208;Michael Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printing material platform based on polythioenones (PCTE) is introduced. The thioenone monomers are synthesized in a scalable two&#8208;step process and are readily amenable to diversification. PCTE&#8722;Ph exhibits excellent tensile strength, machinability, and recyclability, achieving 90&#8201;% depolymerization yield in a closed&#8208;loop polymerization/depolymerization cycle. Its performance in fused&#8208;filament fabrication (FFF) highlights its potential for advanced additive manufacturing.







Abstract
The development of chemically recyclable polymers for sustainable 3D printing is crucial to reducing plastic waste and advancing towards a circular polymer economy. Here, we introduce a new class of polythioenones (PCTE) synthesized via Michael addition&#8208;elimination ring&#8208;opening polymerization (MAEROP) of cyclic thioenone (CTE) monomers. The designed monomers are straightforward to synthesize, scalable and highly modular, and the resulting polymers display mechanical performance superior to commodity polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The material was successfully employed in 3D printing using fused&#8208;filament fabrication (FFF), showcasing excellent printability and mechanical recyclability. Notably, PCTE&#8722;Ph retains its tensile strength and thermal stability after multiple mechanical recycling cycles. Furthermore, PCTE&#8722;Ph can be depolymerized back to its original monomer with a 90&#8201;% yield, allowing for repolymerization and establishing a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle, making it a sustainable alternative for additive manufacturing applications.

         <title>Hybrid CIGS&#8208;Cobalt Quaterpyridine Photocathode with Backside Illumination: A New Paradigm for Solar Fuel Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and selective solar&#8208;driven conversion of CO2 to CO has been achieved using a Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite&#8208;based photocathode, coated with a cobalt molecular catalyst and operated under backside illumination. This innovative design addresses the challenges associated with the absorption properties of the catalyst and the protection layer, paving the way for high&#8208;performance and versatile photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices.







Abstract
Chalcogenide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solar cell optimized for rear illumination and used for CO2 reduction is presented. Central to this innovation is a thinner, Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite absorber coated with a robust metallic top layer, which potentially surpasses the performance of conventional front&#8208;illuminated designs. Using cobalt quaterpyridine molecular catalyst, photocurrent densities for CO2 reduction exceeding 10&#8197;mA/cm2 at 0.0&#8201;V vs. RHE under 1&#8197;Sun illumination, and ca. 16&#8197;mA/cm2 at &#8722;0.25&#8201;V vs. RHE were achieved in voltammetry experiments. Controlled potential electrolysis showed catalytic activity over 20&#8197;h with selectivity for CO ranging from &gt;92&#8201;% (first 4&#8197;hours) to 86&#8201;% at the end of the experiment. This approach opens limitless possibilities for employing various reduction catalysts, extending far beyond CO2 reduction. It imposes minimal constraints on absorption properties, immobilization methods, and catalyst nature, setting the stage for high&#8208;performance, adaptable PEC devices.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Uric Acid Oxidation via Interdistance&#8208;Dependent Switching Pathways in Correlated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Boosting Sensing Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overly simplistic geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a significant bottleneck in the field of single&#8208;atom sensing, impeding both the design of highly efficient electrochemical sensors and the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy to boost the sensing performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by precisely tuning the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs). A series of Ru&#8208;based c&#8208;SACs (Rud=6.2 &#197;, Rud=7.0 &#197;, and Rud=9.3 &#197;) are synthesized with predetermined SAD values, which are comprehensively characterized by various techniques. Electrochemical studies on uric acid (UA) oxidation reveal that Rud=6.2 &#197; demonstrates an extraordinary sensitivity of 9.83 &#956;A &#956;M&#8208;1cm&#8208;2, which is superior to most of electrochemistry biosensors reported previously. Kinetic analysis and product examination unveil that the 6.2 &#197; Ru SAD instigates a distinctive three&#8208;electron oxidation of UA, with an extra electron transfer compared to the conventional two&#8208;electron pathway, which fundamentally enhances its sensitivity. Density functional theory calculations confirm the optimal SAD facilitates dual&#8208;site UA adsorption and accelerated charge transfer dynamics. This investigation provides novel insights into the strategic engineering of high&#8208;performance SAC&#8208;based electrochemical sensors by precisely controlling the atomic&#8208;scale structure of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver Molybdate Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy through Pyroptosis Conversion and Ferroptosis Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroptosis hold great potential in tumor therapy due to its strong immunogenicity. Several strategies, including ion interference therapy (IIT), are developed to induce pyroptosis. However, the mechanism by which metal oxoanions induced pyroptosis remained unclear. It was reported that MoO42&#8722; ions could stimulate immune responses, but their pyroptosis&#8208;inducing mechanisms were not fully understood. Herein, we synthesized uniform and dispersed silver molybdate (Ag2MoO4) nanoparticles (AMO) via a solvothermal method. AMO responded to H2O2 and glutathione (GSH) stimuli, releasing Ag+ and MoO42&#8722; ions, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and depleting GSH, thereby inducing ferroptosis and pyroptosis. The MoO42&#8722; also inhibited cell migration and upregulated GSDME expression, converting apoptosis into caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Additionally, DNA damage and ROS activated the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, enhancing innate immunity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of AMO and the immune checkpoint inhibitor &#945;PD&#8208;1 significantly inhibited tumor growth. This combination promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation, increased effector T cell numbers, induced M1 macrophage polarization, and alleviated immunosuppression. This study contributed to a deeper understanding of metal oxoanion&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, supporting its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transmission and Amplification from Cellulose Derivative to Achiral Helical Polymer for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellulose derivatives represent a promising natural chiral platform for creating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials owing to their excellent processability and structural diversity. However, achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions based on cellulose derivatives remains challenging. The present work reports the first success in achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions leveraging chirality transmission and amplification from cellulose derivative to achiral helical polymer. Importantly, such chirality transfer displays a dependence on the hydrogen bond accepting ability of solvent, making it effortless to precisely regulate chiral intensity by single or combined solvents. Moreover, the induced chirality in helical polymer is further transferred to the introduced racemic fluorescent dyes, resulting in full&#8208;color and white&#8208;light CPL emissions with a maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and 62.9%, respectively. Further spatially separating the chiral and fluorescent components allows inversion of CPL handedness and precise modulation of CPL intensity. Notably, circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and chiral logic gate with multiple information outputs are successfully developed. This work gives an impetus to construct cellulosic chiroptical materials, offering more insights into chirality transfer between biomacromolecules and synthetic helical polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Residual Monomer&#8208;Induced Side Reactions in Gel Polymer Electrolytes: Unveiled High&#8208;Ni Cathode Failure in Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high&#8208;Ni cathodes (NCM) has emerged as a compelling approach for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, capable of circumventing NCM failure modes in liquid electrolytes. However, a detailed origin of capacity decay caused by residual monomers from an uncontrollable curing process has been largely ignored. Here, we report an in&#8208;depth investigation into the side reactions of unreacted monomers within typical GPEs at the NCM cathode interfaces by utilizing multiscale spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. We evaluate conversion rate&#8208;interphase structure correlation, revealing that interfacial evolution is highly dependent on residual monomer content. Specifically, the degradation chemistry in NCM cathodes with thermally cured gel polymer electrolytes (TC&#8208;GPEs) is governed by monomer&#8208;initiated interphase reconstruction, leading to an imbalanced interphase growth mode with organic&#8208;rich species and retarded diffusion kinetics through the electrode. We further reveal that organic ether/ester&#8208;based byproducts, caused by the oxidative decomposition of unreacted monomers during the initial charging step, are the key factor for the acceleration of NCM failure modes. This study elucidates the multiscale fading mechanism in the NCM||GPE system, providing improved insights into interphase issues in typical GPEs and facilitating the further development of long&#8208;life NCM||GPE prototypes for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway Engineering in Pd&#8208;Based Supramolecular Cage Synthesis via Inner&#8208;Outer Steric Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For artificial supramolecular architectures designed to mimic biological systems, achieving different pathway synthesis is challenging due to the requirement of multiple stable and interconvertible intermediates. Here, we propose a novel &#8220;inner&#8208;outer steric synergy&#8221; strategy and investigate controllable pathway engineering for the synthesis of specific structures. Firstly, three structures (Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3 or Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4) with interconversion properties were selectively formed by assembling externally modified ligand LA with Pd(II). Furthermore, Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2 can further assemble with the ligand LB with inner steric hindrance to generate heteroleptic trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 cage, while Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, as an intermediate, can assemble with LB to form Pd2LA3LB. It is noteworthy that Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, and Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4 can interconvert under specific conditions, enabling the synthesis of Pd2LA3LB and trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 through 10 and 16 pathways, respectively. This research not only introduces a novel strategy for constructing heteroleptic cages but also demonstrates the achievement of pathway engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Renewable Terephthalates and Aromatic Diisocyanates from Galactose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum&#8208;derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D&#8208;galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram&#8208;scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram&#8208;scale preparation of 1,4&#8208;phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5&#8208;toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes. Preparation of these renewable aromatic diisocyanates proceeds without the use of high&#8208;pressure gases or costly transition&#8208;metals and represents a novel route to fully renewable aromatic diisocyanates.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum-derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D-galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels-Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram-scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram-scale preparation of 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5-toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes. Preparation of these renewable aromatic diisocyanates proceeds without the use of high-pressure gases or costly transition-metals and represents a novel route to fully renewable aromatic diisocyanates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Polymer Interphase with Fast Kinetics for Ultrahigh&#8208;rate Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quinone polymer (PPPA) interphase with a planar and linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure can significantly boosts the performance of AZIBs. The expansion of &#960;&#8208;conjugated planes in PPPA molecules accelerates the transfer of intramolecular electrons during charge/discharge, which boosts the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+, redistributes Zn2+ flux and facilitates diffusion of Zn2+. This results in dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;rate Zn deposition.







Abstract
Polymer interphase on Zn anodes obviates dendrite growth and significant side reactions including corrosion and hydrogen evolution in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), however has drawbacks of slow kinetics and large overpotential for Zn plating/stripping that prevent practical application especially under high&#8208;rate conditions. Here, a multifunctional polymer interphase with fast kineticsis reported, using poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) as an electrolyte additive. PPPA, with linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and enriched polar pyridine (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to form a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in situ. The PPPA SEI is efficient to block direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode, and regulate the interfacial solvation structure and Zn depostion. Importantly, the expanding &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of PPPA is shown to provide abundant 2D open channels for rapid Zn2+ transport, and the delocalized &#960; electrons form a space electrostatic field to facilitate de&#8208;solvation and diffusion of Zn2+. As a result, the Zn metal anode with PPPA/ZnSO4 electrolyte exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3 % at current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201; cm&#8722;2, and excellent cycle lifespan for over 2000 cycles (400&#8197;h) at current density 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and plating/stripping capacity of 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||MnO2 full battery exhibited a discharge capacity of 74.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles at the current density of 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, demonstrating practical feasibility. It is concluded that judicious engineering of polymer additives and interphase will benefit the development of commercial AZIBs with fast kinetics for high&#8208;rate applications.

         <title>Triplet Exciplex Mediated Multi&#8208;Color Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow Mate&#8208;rials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bi&#8208;component room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that display a near&#8208;infrared afterglow have been prepared. The triplet state of the host has been shown to transfer energy to the dopant via a triplet exciplex, leading to a highly persistent emission.







Abstract
Organic long&#8208;lived phosphorescent materials demonstrating ultra&#8208;long photoluminescence have practical advantages owing to their flexible design and easy processability. However, the exact photophysical process underpinning the persistent&#8208;luminescent continues to elude full understanding, and the principles governing the compatibility of hosts and guests remain elusive. In this work, a new type of nonradiative energy transfer mechanism is proposed for the bi&#8208;component RTP system. Different from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter&#8208;type energy transfer, this energy transfer mechanism primarily relies on a triplet exciplex to exchange the electron. This facilitates the formation of triplet excitons that are otherwise difficult to excite directly. An evaluation methodology is devised to gauge the potential of a specific dopant&#8208;host combination toward generating pronounced afterglow. According to this framework, the enhancement of the afterglow is proportional to the decrease in the activation energy (&#916;G&#8800;) associated with the electron transfer reaction between the dopant and the host. Notably, when the &#916;G&#8800; too larger, no observable afterglow occurs, as higher &#916;G&#8800; values significantly impede the electron transfer reaction between the two components. Furthermore, the remarkable dependence of afterglow intensity on the dopant concentration renders the bi&#8208;component RTP system highly promising for applications requiring ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and broad&#8208;spectrum detection capabilities.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Confined Disordered Hydrogen Bonds Enable Efficient Lithium Transport in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State PEO&#8208;Based Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ASSEs) optimization approach with surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bonds is developed through the construction of rich donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. The crystallization inhibition of PEO, anchoring of TFSI&#8722;, and weak coordination of Li+ are realized while maintaining the stability of the Li+&#8208;conducting system, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are essential to advance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with high safety/energy density due to their inherent flexibility and scalability. However, the inefficient Li+ transport in PEO often leads to poor rate performance and diminished stability of the ASSLBs. The regulation of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds is regarded as one of the most effective approaches to enable efficient Li+ transport, while the practical performances are hindered by the electrochemical instability of free H&#8208;bond donors and the constrained mobility of highly ordered H&#8208;bonding structures. To overcome these challenges, we develop a surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bond system with stable donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to construct a loosened chain segments/ions arrangement in the bulk phase of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes, realizing the crystallization inhibition of PEO, weak coordination of Li+ and entrapment of anions, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport and stable Li+ deposition. The rationally designed LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLB demonstrates a long cycle&#8208;life of over 400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C and 65&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity retention rate of 87.5&#8201;%, surpassing most of the currently reported polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs. This work highlights the importance of confined disordered H&#8208;bonds on Li+ transport in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery system, paving the way for the future design of polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs.

         <title>In&#8208;tandem Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia on Ultrathin&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Assembled Iron&#8208;Nickel Alloy Nanoflowers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of an ultrathin&#8208;sheet&#8208;like nanoflower Fe&#8722;Ni (Fe80Ni20) alloy on a carbon cloth and electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 through an in&#8208;tandem mechanism.







Abstract
The development of alternative routes for ammonia (NH3) synthesis with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) is crucial for energy conservation and to achieve zero carbon emissions. Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to NH3 (e&#8208;NO3RRA) is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive, fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The implementation of this innovative NH3 synthesis technique requires an efficient electrocatalyst and in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of e&#8208;NO3RRA. In this study, we developed an ultrathin sheet (&#956;m) iron&#8211;nickel nanoflower alloy through electrodeposition and used it for e&#8208;NO3RRA under alkaline conditions. The prepared Fe&#8722;Ni alloy exhibited an FE of 97.28&#177;1.36&#8201;% at &#8722;238&#8197;mVRHE and an NH3 yield rate up to 3999.1&#177;242.59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experimental electrolysis, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations showed that the adsorption and reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; occurred on the Fe surface, whereas subsequent hydrogenation of NO2&#8722; to NH3 occurred preferentially on the Ni surface. The catalysts exhibited comparable FE for at least 10 cycles, with a long&#8208;term stability of 216&#8197;h. Electron paramagnetic resonance results confirmed that adsorbed hydrogen was consumed during e&#8208;NO3RRA. This work introduces a sustainable, robust, and efficient Fe&#8722;Ni alloy electrocatalyst, offering an environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing NH3 from NO3&#8722;&#8208;contaminated water.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through an in-tandem mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of alternative routes for ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) is crucial for energy conservation and to achieve zero carbon emissions. Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (e-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RRA) is a promising alternative to the energy-intensive, fossil-fuel-driven Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The implementation of this innovative NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis technique requires an efficient electrocatalyst and in-depth mechanistic understanding of e-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RRA. In this study, we developed an ultrathin sheet (&#956;m) iron&#8211;nickel nanoflower alloy through electrodeposition and used it for e-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RRA under alkaline conditions. The prepared Fe&#8722;Ni alloy exhibited an FE of 97.28&#177;1.36&#8201;% at &#8722;238&#8197;mV&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; and an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate up to 3999.1&#177;242.59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimental electrolysis, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations showed that the adsorption and reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; occurred on the Fe surface, whereas subsequent hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; occurred preferentially on the Ni surface. The catalysts exhibited comparable FE for at least 10 cycles, with a long-term stability of 216&#8197;h. Electron paramagnetic resonance results confirmed that adsorbed hydrogen was consumed during e-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RRA. This work introduces a sustainable, robust, and efficient Fe&#8722;Ni alloy electrocatalyst, offering an environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Prescribing DNA Origami Barrel&#8208;Directed Subtractive Patterning of Nanoparticles for Crystalline Superstructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using DNA origami barrels, we demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy to create tunable regiospecific patches on gold nanospheres. This enables the assembly of multidimensional superstructures, such as a graphane&#8208;like bilayered lattice, and provides a geometrical model for reverse engineering assembly symmetries. This approach advances nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties for photonic and electronic applications.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range ordered lattices formed by the directed arrangement of colloidal particles hold significant promise for applications such as photonic crystals, plasmonic metamaterials, and semiconductor electronics. Harnessing regioselective interactions through DNA&#8208;mediated assembly is a promising approach to advancing colloidal assembly. Despite efforts to engineer microscale patchy particles using sequence&#8208;specific binding properties of DNA, the control of patch formation on nanoscale isotropic spherical nanoparticles remains challenging. We demonstrate a subtractive patterning strategy using barrel&#8208;shaped DNA origami (DNA barrel) to selectively block surfaces of DNA&#8208;coated gold nanospheres and create regiospecific patches. By designing binding positions and geometric parameters of DNA barrels, we can achieve controlled accessibility to nanosphere surfaces, forming patchy nanoparticles with tunable patch numbers and sizes. This strategy enables the construction of multidimensional superstructures with well&#8208;defined stereo relationships, represented by an unprecedented graphane&#8208;like bilayered superlattice. Furthermore, we developed a geometrical model that accounts for anisotropic particle bonding and steric hindrance, elucidating the relationship between architectural outcomes and the structural parameters of DNA&#8208;barrel&#8208;directed patchy nanoparticles, and enabling reverse engineering designs of potential assembly symmetries. This approach opens new avenues for generating nanoparticle assemblies with distinct symmetries and properties.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroglycosylation of Alkynes for the Synthesis of Vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes was developed with bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction, which proceeds by the intermediacy of glycosyl radicals, affords E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity and can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring compounds.







Abstract
Herein we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes, employing bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl (oIB) substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction occurs with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity to afford E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, a class of compounds nontrivial to access by previous methods. The use of a bis(oxazoline) ligand with bulky side chains is critical for the high selectivities observed. Aryl iodides have not been used previously as surrogates for alkyl (glycosyl) electrophiles in Co&#8722;H catalyzed reactions. The transformation features mild reaction conditions, simple reagents, and broad substrate scope. This method can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring products. Mechanistic studies suggest this stereoconvergent process involves glycosyl radicals as key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Smart Targeting Layer on Silver Nanowire Electrodes Achieving Efficiency Breakthroughs in ITO&#8208;Free Conventional Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored functional targeted molecules to form self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) that precisely wrap around the surface of silver nanowire electrodes. This smart targeting layer enables simultaneous flexible work function tuning and hydrophilicity enhancement for silver nanowire electrodes, resulting in efficiency breakthroughs in conventional flexible organic solar cells with ITO&#8208;free electrodes and exceptional mechanical flexibility.







Abstract
Silver nanowire (AgNW) electrodes, known for their intrinsic flexibility and tunable optoelectronic properties, have garnered considerable attention for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in conventional OSCs, their low work function (WF) causes energy&#8208;level mismatches with classic aqueous hole transport layers (HTLs), while their poor hydrophilicity hinders the formation of optimized HTL morphology and crystallinity, posing challenges to their integration into high&#8208;performance OSCs. To address these issues, functionally targeted molecules with a thiol group at one end and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing, hydrophilic functional groups at the other are precisely engineered to wrap around the AgNW electrodes. The thiol group facilitates the formation of robust self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) on the AgNW electrodes through stable S&#8722;Ag chemical bonds at room temperature. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups generate notable molecular and interfacial dipoles that effectively raise the WF of AgNW electrodes. Notably, the hydrophilic groups not only improve electrode wettability but also promote strong hydrogen bonding interactions with HTL, leading to substantial improvements in the morphology and crystallinity of the HTL. This precision wrapping strategy enables the fabrication of high&#8208;efficient conventional flexible OSCs, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 18.84&#8201;% (certified at 18.56&#8201;%) for flexible OSCs based on ITO&#8208;free transparent electrodes.

         <title>Spatially Separated Redox Centers in Anthraquinone&#8208;grafted Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the process of synergistic multi&#8208;reactions for hydrogen peroxide production, the directional transport of charge carriers is crucial. We present an anthraquinone&#8208;grafted UiO&#8208;66 with piezo&#8208;photocatalytic capabilities, which enables spatially separated redox reaction sites. This strategy of separating redox sites enhances the separation and utilization efficiency of charge carriers, providing a reliable approach for green energy and environmental technologies.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air is promising but its large&#8208;scale application is still challenging as insufficient reaction active sites and low reaction efficiency. We have applied molecular engineering methods to design an anthraquinone molecularly (AQ) grafted metal&#8211;organic framework piezo&#8208;photocatalyst (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ) for H2O2 generation from water and air. The catalyst achieves a peak H2O2 yield of 7872.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 by facilitating two critical reactions: single&#8208;electron water oxidation (WOR) and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (ORR) on spatially separated redox sites. Experiments and computational simulations reveal efficient charge separation through a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;chain transfer mechanism. Electrons and holes are selectively transferred to AQ and UiO&#8208;66 promoting ORR and WOR under ultrasound and visible light. The high reaction rate of ORR (rapid generation of endoperoxide) compensates for the slow kinetics of WOR (generation of OH*) and greatly increases the rate of full&#8208;reaction of H2O2 production. Additionally, a continuous flow tubular reactor equipped with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ catalytic membranes affords 96&#8201;% removal of organic dyes by a in situFenton process under visible light and water flow, confirming the significant potential of the catalyst for practical applications. This work deepens the understanding of directional carrier migration at piezo&#8208;photocatalytic spatial separation sites, opening new pathways for environmentally friendly and efficient H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Cr Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr single&#8208;atom catalyst with excellent oxygen reduction activity and proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance has been discovered for the first time.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs) are promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Their ORR activity and selectivity are significantly affected by the heteroatoms that coordinate the central metal atoms. Previous reports found that oxygen&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs promoted a 2e&#8722; ORR rather than the 4e&#8722; ORR that is more desirable for fuel cells. Herein, we report for the first time that oxygen&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs are capable of promoting the 4e&#8722; ORR in acid media. We prepared a Cr(acac)&#8208;NC catalyst with the central Cr atom coordinated by two O atoms. The Cr(acac)&#8208;NC catalyst not only exhibits excellent ORR activity and stability in acid media, but also delivers high proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance comparable to N&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Cr&#8722;O2 moieties located on the zigzag edge of the carbon support are the ORR&#8208;active sites.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Allyl Ketones via BINAP&#8208;CuH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy allyl ketones: A highly enantioselective CuH&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of benzhydryloxyallene for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones is reported. This highly facile and sustainable method also provides access to syn&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones with&#945;&#8208;substituted carboxylic anhydrides through &#8216;matched&#8208;mismatched&#8217; reaction pathway.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrocupration of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds to generate organometallic nucleophiles has recently become an attractive alternative to conventional stoichiometric reagents in the stereoselective synthesis. Herein, we have developed an efficient and economical method to synthesize enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy allyl ketones via a copper hydride (CuH)&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of alkoxyallenes, a significant advancement given the scarcity of reports on such scaffolds in the literature. DFT calculations reveal that this reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic attack of a kinetically favourable Z&#8208;selective allyl&#8208;copper intermediate on acid anhydrides via a six&#8208;membered chair&#8208;like transition state, stabilized by strongly attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions that ultimately leads to high level of enantioselectivities using the simple BINAP ligand. This method successfully overcomes the challenges of over&#8208;reduction of carbonyl functionality in the presence of CuH&#8208;complex, olefin isomerization and the presence of a highly enolizable &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, which can lead to erosion in enantioselectivities, making our strategy highly desirable. The reaction exhibits a wide range of substrate scope including symmetrical as well as carbonic anhydrides with both aromatic, and aliphatic substitutions. In addition, &#945;&#8208;substituted acid anhydrides provide exclusive syn&#8208;selective &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted allyl ketones in excellent enantiomeric ratios, where the nucleophilic allylation occurs on one of the carbonyls containing the matched &#945;&#8208;stereocenter, confirmed with mechanistic studies.

         <title>Leveraging Carbon Quantum Dot Spacers as Dual Proton/Electron Boosters to Upgrade TiO2@Polydopamine Photocatalysts for pH&#8208;Resilient Conversion of O2 into H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CDs act as spacers to buffer the concentration of protons of the interspatial microenvironment between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, which sustain high and stable local acidity therein and, at the same time, boost the transfer of protons and photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 cores to their PDA shells with excellent kinetic matching with each other.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, which is generally jeopardized by the kinetic mismatch between photogenerated electron transfer and proton supply. To address the challenge, here we proposed a new core&#8211;shell design of nanocomposite catalysts comprising of carbon quantum dot (CD)&#8208;topped TiO2 nanoparticles encapsulated by polydopamine (PDA) shells, which delivered stable catalytic activity across a pH range of 1&#8211;9, exhibiting a photocatalytic generation rate of H2O2 that reached 18.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in methanol and 8.66&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in water. This extraordinary, pH&#8208;tolerant photocatalytic generation of H2O2 was benefited from the innovative use of CDs, interspaced between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, not only as a reservoir of protons to buffer the local acidic microenvironment but also as a proton/electron dual booster to sustain an excellent kinetic match between the proton and photogenerated electron transfer, thus enabling the O2 reduction to selectively proceed via two&#8208;electron reaction pathway over a wide pH span.

Composite membranes with nacre&#8208;like &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure were developed. Dominant &#8220;brick&#8221; microporous ZIF&#8208;8 allows fast H2 transport, while &#8220;mortar&#8221; Zn&#8208;polyethyleneimine coordination polymer interlayer combined with adhesive interface reduces intercrystalline transport and provides highly H2 selective transport pathway, resulting in a record&#8208;high H2 permeability along with an excellent H2/CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with high stability and porosity is a promising candidate for hydrogen separation membranes. However, most ZIF&#8208;8 polycrystalline membranes exhibit low H2/CO2 (kinetic diameters of 2.9/3.3&#8197;&#197;) mixed gas selectivity, due to the intercrystalline defects and the unprecise molecular sieving originated from framework flexibility of ZIF&#8208;8 structure with a theoretical aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197;. Here, inspired by nacre's &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure, we develop mixed matrix type composite membranes in which dominant crystalline ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (bricks) are interconnected by ultrathin zinc coordination polymer interlayers (mortar) via self&#8208;assembling. Driven by coordination bonds between Zn2+ from precursor colloid and branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a zinc coordination polymer network is formed to connect ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles through interactions between Zn2+ of coordination polymer and surface terminal groups on ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles, thus eliminating intercrystalline void defects and providing a highly selective H2 transport pathway. Meanwhile, the micropores and large cavities in ZIF&#8208;8 allow fast H2 transport. Benefitting from both highly selective pathway and fast H2 transport through porous ZIF&#8208;8, the optimized ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;PEI membrane exhibits a record&#8208;high H2 permeability of ~1.78&#215;105 Barrer with a high mixed gas H2/CO2 selectivity of 176, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. This bioinspired multifunctional membrane expands the scope of molecular sieving membrane.

Description: The capacity and energy density of manganese metal batteries are greatly enhanced by developing the first cathode based on dual storage mechanism in this work.







Abstract
As a promising post lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery candidate, manganese metal battery (MMB) is receiving growing research interests because of its high volumetric capacity, low cost, high safety and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the low energy density, mainly constrained by scarce choices and unsatisfying capacity of cathodes, strictly bottlenecks the development of MMBs. In this work, a new class of cathodes based on novel dual&#8208;storage mechanism (DSM) are reported. Working principles of DSM are revealed and deeply understood via ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DSM&#8208;based Cu1.8S cathode, which shows the highest specific capacity of 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 97.1&#8201;% higher energy density than previously reported cathodes in storing Mn2+ ions, is presented. The key determinants on DSM and design strategies for next&#8208;generation cathodes are revealed via theoretical calculations. This work provides a new class of high&#8208;capacity cathode materials for MMBs, which is expected to draw inspirations to further enhance the energy density of MMBs.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State and Steric Hindrances Engineering Enable Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Narrowband Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters with Enhanced Quenching Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple donors have been integrated into multi&#8208;resonance moieties to engineer excited states and steric hindrances to generate blue and green thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with enhanced quenching resistance and spin&#8208;flip processes. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show high external quantum efficiencies, reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability across a wide dopant concentration.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials have great potential for applications in ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays, that benefit from their narrowband emission characteristic. However, key challenges such as aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and slow triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip process, especially for blue MR&#8208;TADF materials, continue to impede their development due to planar skeletons and relatively large &#916;ESTs. Here, an effective strategy that incorporates multiple carbazole donors into the parent MR moieties is proposed, synergistically engineering their excited states and steric hindrances to enhance both the spin&#8208;flip process and quenching resistance. As expected, the designed materials namely 5Cz&#8208;BNO and 5Cz&#8208;BN exhibit bright blue and green emissions with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) around 23&#8197;nm, together with significantly improved reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. The OLEDs based on 5Cz&#8208;BNO and 5Cz&#8208;BN with doping concentrations from 5 to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values exceeding 30&#8201;% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;offs and improved operational stability. This work offers an effective approach for designing doping&#8208;insensitive blue and green MR&#8208;TADF materials with fast spin&#8208;flip processes by integrating the engineering of excited states and steric hindrances.

         <title>Capturing the Progressive Conformational Evolutions of Sterically&#8208;Congested Dihydrophenazines via Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progressive bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar conformational evolutions of sterically congested dihydrophenazines were successfully captured by freezing distinct conformations in various crystalline forms. This provided direct structural evidence for understanding the photoinduced structural planarization of the polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with a central cyclic 8&#960;&#8208;electron ring.







Abstract
To gain a deeper understanding of the sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolutions of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC) luminophores, we strategically freeze distinct conformations by crystallization, allowing to capture the progressive conformational transformations within a DPAC&#8208;based framework by utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Our focus lies in the innovative modification of DPAC via the synthesis of cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted derivatives DPAC&#8208;nCN (n=1&#8211;4, with n indicating the number of CN groups). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing CN groups modulates electron delocalization and lowers energy barriers, facilitating access to conformational polymorphism within the crystals. Unlike the limited diversity observed in the crystallization behaviour of DPAC, the DPAC&#8208;2CN to DPAC&#8208;4CN derivatives exhibit distinct crystalline forms, with conformational diversity increasing in tandem with the number of CN substituents. Notably, the single DPAC&#8208;4CN molecule features multi&#8208;colored crystals transitioning from blue to red, with the folding angle of the polycyclic dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine ring progressive varying from ~130&#176; to ~172&#176;. Additionally, DPAC&#8208;4CN&#8217;s red crystals with high&#8208;energy planar conformation (~172&#176;) can experience a sudden jumping when subjected to stimuli. This study not only advances the understanding of conformational dynamics in dihydrophenazines but also paves a new way for the development of dynamic crystal materials.

         <title>A ZnO&#8208;based Catalytic System for the Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system (ZnO(OVs)/Zn plate) has an internal electron source for the synthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen in ambient air. Water forms a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface, accelerating the oxygen transfer from the ambient air to the catalyst surface and facilitating the separation and collection of the reaction product.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has a wide range of applications as an eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable oxidant. However, the clean, efficient and convenient synthesis of this compound remains challenging. This work demonstrates a rationally designed electron&#8208;self&#8208;supplied catalytic system capable of generating H2O2 from water and atmospheric oxygen without extra energy input. This catalytic system is made of a ZnO coating containing oxygen vacancies and a Zn substrate. The ZnO catalyst layer obtains electrons from the Zn substrate to synthesize H2O2. The H2O2 concentration produced by this catalytic system is up to 17.9&#8197;mM without any secondary processing. This remarkably high concentration is attributed to the formation of a liquid film on the hydrophilic ZnO surface that promotes the oxygen reduction reaction by accelerating the transfer of oxygen from the ambient air to the catalyst surface. By integrating with atmospheric fog collection, this system can continuously collect H2O2 directly from the air.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Elucidation of Lattice&#8208;Hydrogens in Copper Catalysts for Selective CO2 Electrochemical Conversion toward C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper hydrides featuring cavities, AuCu24&#8208;dppp nanoclusters, reveal the catalytic active unit Cu3H3, elucidating the role of lattice&#8208;hydrogens mechanism in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products. The AuCu24&#8208;dppp clusters efficiently reduce CO2 into deeply reduced products, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 54.5&#8201;% &#8211; comprising 41.9&#8201;% for C2H4 and 12.6&#8201;% for EtOH &#8211; while demonstrating exceptional stability.







Abstract
Copper is the most efficient and practical electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ECR) to give multicarbon (C2+) products, but the mechanism by which such products are formed &#8211; though known to involve lattice&#8208;hydrogens &#8211; remains elusive, and the selectivity of the reaction is poor. Herein, we report the synthesis of [AuCu24(dppp)6H22]+, a copper hydride nanocluster bearing exposed Cu3H3 units in specific surface cavities, and our use of it to study the mechansim and selectivity of the reduction of CO2 to C2+ products. Results of in situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations showed that these Cu3H3 units can effectively lower the energy barrier to the formation of the *COCOH intermediate, which allowed the competition between the C1 and C2 pathways to be elucidated. Isotope labeling experiments and catalyst recrystallization studies corroborated the theoretical simulations, identifying the lattice&#8208;hydrogen (H&#8722;) in the Cu3H3 active unit as being indispensable for the formation of C2H4.

&lt;p&gt;Copper hydrides featuring cavities, AuCu&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;-dppp nanoclusters, reveal the catalytic active unit Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, elucidating the role of lattice-hydrogens mechanism in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to multi-carbon products. The AuCu&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;-dppp clusters efficiently reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into deeply reduced products, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 54.5&#8201;% &#8211; comprising 41.9&#8201;% for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 12.6&#8201;% for EtOH &#8211; while demonstrating exceptional stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper is the most efficient and practical electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ECR) to give multicarbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products, but the mechanism by which such products are formed &#8211; though known to involve lattice-hydrogens &#8211; remains elusive, and the selectivity of the reaction is poor. Herein, we report the synthesis of [AuCu&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(dppp)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a copper hydride nanocluster bearing exposed Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units in specific surface cavities, and our use of it to study the mechansim and selectivity of the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products. Results of in situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations showed that these Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units can effectively lower the energy barrier to the formation of the *COCOH intermediate, which allowed the competition between the C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pathways to be elucidated. Isotope labeling experiments and catalyst recrystallization studies corroborated the theoretical simulations, identifying the lattice-hydrogen (H&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in the Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; active unit as being indispensable for the formation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The molecular design guidelines which this work has facilitated constitute a new approach towards the of copper-based catalysts that convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products based on lattice-hydrogen engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Li&#8722;CO2 Battery Performance via High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts: Insights into Configurational Entropy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different mix configurational entropy (&#9653;Smix) values supported on carbon nanofibers were designed to serve as the cathode catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, demonstrating a positive correlation between &#9653;Smix and catalytic activity.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries have attracted considerable attention for their ability to combine CO2 fixation and conversion with high&#8208;density energy storage. However, sluggish kinetics of CO2 reduction and evolution reactions at cathodes lead to large overpotentials and poor cyclic stability. To address this issue, it is critical to develop advanced cathode catalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), a new class of catalysts, have exhibited exceptional catalytic activities in various electrochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the intrinsic relationship between mix configurational entropy (&#9653;Smix) and catalytic properties of HEAs remains unclear. Herein, we prepared a series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different &#9653;Smix values supported on carbon nanofibers as cathode catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. Experimental and computational results reveal a positive correlation between &#9653;Smix and catalytic activity, attributed to charge redistribution among elements with different electronegativities. The Li&#8722;CO2 battery using the alloy catalyst with the maximum &#9653;Smix value delivers the largest capacity of 6160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, the lowest charge potential plateau below 4.0&#8197;V, and remarkable cycling stability (550&#8197;cycles/5500&#8197;h), surpassing most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, fabrication of pouch cells with low noble metal loading demonstrates the practical potential of HEAs for Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. This work provides insights into high&#8208;entropy engineering for advanced electrocatalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy to Transform Cationic Polymers for Efficient and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy was used to transform low&#8208;cost and ineffective cationic polymers into phospholipidated and alkylated polymers (PAPs), which robustly delivered mRNA to the spleen in vivo. PAPs loaded with mRNA encoding model antigen could induce robust anti&#8208;tumor response, suggesting their great potential for vaccine application. Additionally, by incorporating different helper lipids, PAP&#8208;based four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) specifically delivered mRNA to the lung and liver, respectively. This strategy advances both the polymer&#8208; and lipid&#8208;based mRNA delivery systems.







Abstract
The progress of mRNA therapeutics underscores the imperative demand for the development of targeted delivery systems. While cationic polymers hold promise as genetic vectors, their poor in vivo efficacy and numerous variants highlight the urgent need for a universal functionalization strategy to bolster their delivery capabilities. Here, we present a versatile strategy to transform low&#8208;cost commercial cationic polymers into phospholipidated and alkylated polymers (PAPs), enabling efficient and organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery in vivo. This straightforward post&#8208;functionalization method can be readily broadened to a diverse array of existing cationic polymers, enhancing their cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and mRNA release functionalities. Consequently, PAPs facilitate up to 30,500&#8208;fold higher mRNA expression compared to their unmodified counterparts in vivo. Notably, the one&#8208;component PAPs enable spleen&#8208;specific mRNA delivery, with their vaccine application validated in a mouse melanoma model following intravenous administration. Better still, PAPs can synergize with different helper lipids to formulate four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), achieving respective lung&#8208; and liver&#8208;specific mRNA delivery. Noteworthy is that these organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery systems significantly outperform previous polymer and LNP benchmarks. This transformation strategy for cationic polymers represents a generalized methodology to give highly effective mRNA carriers, highlighting substantial potential for clinical translation of mRNA therapies with organ&#8208;targeting requirements.

         <title>Redirecting On&#8208;surface Cycloaddition Reactions in a Self&#8208;assembled Ordered Molecular Array on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis on chemically inert substrates via thermal activation is extremely challenging in ultra&#8208;high vacuum, suffering from a severe &#8220;desorption problem&#8221;. Here, we report an extraordinary [2+2]+[2+2] cycloaddition via dehydrohalogenations in a highly ordered self&#8208;assembled molecular array on graphite, where the cycloaddition products are embedded as defective individuals or chains (grain boundaries) even with productivities over 30&#8201;%.







Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise carbon nanostructures in ultra&#8208;high vacuum has seen extensive progress on metal surfaces. However, this remains challenging on chemically inert surfaces. It is because the thermally activated C&#8722;C coupling encounters a severe &#8220;desorption problem&#8221; on weakly interacting substrates. In this study, we report an extraordinary [2+2]+[2+2] cycloaddition triggered by mild annealing (~210&#176;C) in a highly ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular array on graphite using scanning tunneling microscopy. In contrast to irregular dendritic fragments typically obtained on metal substrates, large supramolecular islands are observed here with cycloaddition products and other polymers over 30&#8201;%, which are embedded as defective individuals or chains (grain boundaries). First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the energy barriers of the multiple dehydrohalogenation and cycloaddition reactions are reduced by catalytic Fe atoms but remain energetically unfavorable. A distinct driving mechanism is proposed for redirecting the reactions on graphite surface, where additional intermolecular coupling, steric hindrance, and interfacial interactions play significant roles. This study introduces a new paradigm for understanding on&#8208;surface synthesis on non&#8208;metal substrates.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electric Field of an S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction by an Ultrasonication&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Effect for Sonocatalytic Therapy of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with traditional antibiotic therapy, photo&#8208; and sonodynamic therapies generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for effectively combating drug resistance. This study address challenges in the low ROS generation efficiency of piezoelectric materials and sonosensitizers through molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy indicates advantages in combating antibiotics&#8208;resistant bacteria and deep tissue infections, but challenges remain in the less efficient charge transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of sonosensitizers. Herein, an effective bactericidal strategy is developed through enhancing the interfacial electric field (IEF) of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions by an ultrasonication&#8208;triggered piezoelectric effect. Hollow barium titanate (hBT) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared through template etching, followed by in situ assembly of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with Zn2+ to obtain hBT@ZnTCPP. Both experimental and theoretical evidences support the notion that an IEF is generared from ZnTCPP to hBT. Compared to metalloporphyrins with Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+, the stronger reduction of ZnTCPP induced by elevation of the orbital energy level of porphyrins after Zn2+ coordination leads to formation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The ultrasonication&#8208;activated polarization field enhances IEF and boosts energy band bending of hBT@ZnTCPP to promote electron&#8208;hole separations and ROS generations. Planktonic methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and their derived biofilms are completely destroyed within 5&#160;min under ultrasonication through up&#8208;regulating genes of glucose catabolism and ion transportation and down&#8208;regulating genes of ribosomal synthesis and transmembrane transporter. Thus, this study demonstrates molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic therapy of bacterial infections.

Compared to metalloporphyrins with Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the stronger reduction of ZnTCPP induced by elevation of the orbital energy level of porphyrins after Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination leads to formation of S-scheme heterojunctions. The ultrasonication-activated polarization field enhances IEF and boosts energy band bending of hBT@ZnTCPP to promote electron-hole separations and ROS generations. Planktonic methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and their derived biofilms are completely destroyed within 5&#160;min under ultrasonication through up-regulating genes of glucose catabolism and ion transportation and down-regulating genes of ribosomal synthesis and transmembrane transporter. Thus, this study demonstrates molecular-level modulation of energy levels for S-scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic therapy of bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Aggregation State to Achieve Low&#8208;Temperature Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing the solvent chemistry, the aggregation states have been disrupted, leading to the formation of contact ion pairs within weakly solvating electrolytes. This approach effectively isolates the solvation structure, reducing interactions between structures. Consequently, it maintains a favorable low desolvation energy barrier and anions&#8208;driven SEI. Simultaneously, it enhances ion migration kinetics, enabling fast charging at low temperatures.







Abstract
Insufficient ionic conductivity and elevated desolvation energy barrier of electrolytes limit the low&#8208;temperature applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Weakly solvating electrolytes (WSEs), with limited lithium salt dissociation capability, are prone to desolvate and drive anion&#8208;rich aggregates (AGGs). However, significant AGGs result in increased viscosity and low ionic mobility, contributing to battery failure at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). Here, we propose and achieve a transformation of WSEs&#8217; solvation structures from AGGs to contact ion pairs (CIPs) through modulating the overall solvation capability, thereby achieving the balance between weak Li+&#8208; solvent interactions and desired ion migration kinetics. Remarkably, CIPs&#8208;dominated electrolyte shows a ten&#8208;fold increase in ionic conductivity compared to conventional WSEs. The Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) battery achieves more than 1400 cycles with 86.9&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C. The practical 1.2&#8197;Ah LFP pouch cell delivered 69&#8201;% of the capacity at 25&#8201;&#176;C when cycled at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy for solvation structure transformation in WSEs provides a novel approach for the development of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Prediction and Validation of Mechanical Flexibility in Molecular Crystals: Dispersion Interactions Dictate Bending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically flexible crystals are a rapidly growing class of functional molecular materials. Typically, such flexible crystals are discovered by serendipity. Herein, we have predicted mechanical flexibility in a series of molecular crystals based on a structure screening approach that combines interaction topology and the presence of nitrile&#215;&#215;&#215;nitrile interactions &#8211; a supramolecular motif hitherto not associated with bending property. Further, we have experimentally validated plastic/elastic bending properties in a series of crystal structures thus predicted. However, four out of five of these crystals showed the bending direction along &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; stacking despite the fact that the direction of strongest interaction anisotropy was rendered by the nitrile&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;nitrile interaction motifs. This is contrary to the commonly perceived anisotropy model and underscores the dominant role of dispersion forces over the electrostatically stabilized motifs in dictating the bending phenomena in molecular crystals. The interaction energies of these motifs have been evaluated using accurate structures from X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography.&#160;Analyses combining elastic tensors, interaction anisotropy indices, thermal expansion studies, and high&#8208;pressure simulations quantify the relative roles of the nitrile&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;nitrile motif and &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; stacking in mechanical flexibility.&#160;Our results point to the possibility of expanding the realm of flexible molecular materials by predictive computational models.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Chemistry Manipulated Iodine Redox Thermodynamics For Durable Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diverse valences of iodine enable it with multi&#8208;electron transfer capability for energy dense batteries. However, previous studies indicate that the primary I&#8722;/I2 redox couple exhibits distinct behaviors depending on electrolyte choice, with the mechanistic basis of aqueous versus nonaqueous systems remaining unclear. Here, we elucidated the solvent effect on iodine redox, particularly focusing on polyiodide formation and their molecular interaction correlations. We validate that a thermodynamically one&#8208;step conversion reaction (I2 &#8596; I&#8722;) occurs in the protic solvents, while it is a two&#8208;step transformation (I2 &#8596; I3&#8722; &#8596; I&#8722;) in aprotic solvents. This distinction arises from strong electron&#8208;donating properties in aprotic solvents that facilitate charge transfer with iodine, promoting complexation with iodide as solvent&#183;I3&#8722; species. Conversely, protic solvents form additional hydrogen bonds with iodine, alleviating polarization and reducing interaction with iodide. Furthermore, to address the limitations of single protic electrolytes&#8212;characterized by sluggish dissolution&#8208;precipitation and slow ion migration rates&#8212;we propose a hybrid electrolyte combining water and ethylene glycol. These hybrids enhance iodine redox kinetics, inhibits I3&#8722; generation, and modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to mitigate zinc anode corrosion and dendrite. The Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability in a wide temperature range, highlighting its potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article we report that the air&#8208;stable &#8220;naked nickel&#8221; [Ni(4&#8208;CF3stb)3] is a competent catalyst in the catalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction (SMC) between heteroaryl bromides and heteroaromatic boron&#8208;based nucleophiles. The catalytic system is characterized by its ability to avoid decomposition or deactivation in the presence of multiple Lewis&#8208;basic sites. The protocol permits the formation of C&#8210;C bonds between two heteroaryl moieties in the absence of complex exogenous ligands, thus minimizing screening procedures and simplifying reaction setups. This method accommodates combinations of distinct 6&#8208;membered heteroaryl bromides and 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered heterocyclic B&#8208;based nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing demand for energy and the excessive use of fossil fuels represents one of the main challenges for humanity. Storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds to generate solar fuels or value&#8208;added chemicals without creating additional environmental burdens is a key requirement for a sustainable future. Here we use biomimetic artificial photosynthesis and present a dPCN&#8208;224(H) MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic system, which uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate and convert CO2 to ethanol under atmospheric conditions, at room temperature and in 2&#8208;5 h reaction time. The system provides a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion efficiency (CTE) of 92%. Furthermore, this method also allows the conversion of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC), making it a rapid and versatile method for both dissolved and gaseous CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks via Photoinduced Fluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise and effective patterning strategies are essential for integrating metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into microelectronics, photonics, sensors, and other solid&#8208;state devices. Direct lithography of MOFs with light and other irradiation sources has emerged as a promising patterning strategy. However, existing direct lithography methods often rely on the irradiation&#8208;induced amorphization of the MOFs structures and the breaking of strong covalent bonds in their organic linkers. High&#8208;energy sources (such as X&#8208;rays or electron beams) and large irradiation doses&#8212;conditions unfavorable for scalable patterning&#8212;are thus required. Here, we report a photoinduced fluorination chemistry for patterning various zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) under mild UV irradiation. Using UV doses as low as 10 mJ cm&#8211;2, light&#8208;sensitive fluorine&#8208;containing molecules covalently bond to ZIFs and enhance their stability in water. This creates a water&#8208;stability contrast between ZIFs in exposed and unexposed regions, enabling scalable direct photolithography of ZIFs with high resolution (2 &#956;m) on 4&#8208;inch wafers and flexible substrates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Precise and effective patterning strategies are essential for integrating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into microelectronics, photonics, sensors, and other solid-state devices. Direct lithography of MOFs with light and other irradiation sources has emerged as a promising patterning strategy. However, existing direct lithography methods often rely on the irradiation-induced amorphization of the MOFs structures and the breaking of strong covalent bonds in their organic linkers. High-energy sources (such as X-rays or electron beams) and large irradiation doses&#8212;conditions unfavorable for scalable patterning&#8212;are thus required. Here, we report a photoinduced fluorination chemistry for patterning various zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) under mild UV irradiation. Using UV doses as low as 10 mJ cm&#8211;2, light-sensitive fluorine-containing molecules covalently bond to ZIFs and enhance their stability in water. This creates a water-stability contrast between ZIFs in exposed and unexposed regions, enabling scalable direct photolithography of ZIFs with high resolution (2 &#956;m) on 4-inch wafers and flexible substrates. The patterned ZIFs preserve their original crystallinity and porous properties while gaining increased hydrophobicity. This allows for the demonstration of a water-responsive fluorescent MOFs array with implications in sensing and multicolor information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>GOAT: A Global Optimization Algorithm for Molecules and Atomic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we propose a new Global Optimization Algorithm (GOAT) for molecules and clusters of atoms and show how it can find the global energy minima for both systems without resorting to molecular dynamics (MD). This avoids the potential millions of time&#8208;consuming gradient calculations required by a long MD run. Because of that, it can be used with any regular quantum chemical method, even with the costlier hybrid DFT.
&#160;&#160; &#160;
We showcase its accuracy by running it on various systems, from organic molecules to water clusters, metal complexes, and metal nanoparticles, comparing it with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods such as the Conformer&#8208;Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). We also discuss its underlying theory and mechanisms for succeeding in challenging cases. GOAT is, in general, more efficient and accurate than previous algorithms in finding global minima and succeeds in cases where others cannot due to the free choice for the Potential Energy Surface (PES).</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity in Aerobic Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol over TiO2 Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol using molecular O2 is a promising alternative to the traditional cumene process. However, the selectivity toward phenol is often poor due to the ring&#8208;opening reaction induced by the superoxide radical (&#183;O2&#8208;), which is predominantly produced from the single&#8208;electron reduction of O2. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of TiO2 facilitates the activation of O2 through a two&#8208;electron reduction process instead of a single&#8208;electron reduction. This effectively suppresses the generation of&#183;O2&#8208;, thereby reducing phenol decomposition and significantly enhancing the selectivity. In addition, these OVs can trap the electrons to promote chare separation and serve as the adsorption sites for O2 activation. As a result, the introduction of abundant OVs on the surface of TiO2 not only enhances phenol yield but also importantly improves selectivity toward phenol. This finding enriches our understanding of how OVs influence reaction pathways and product selectivity, providing valuable insights for the design and tailoring of OV&#8208;rich photocatalysts for selective organic oxygenations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I) Halide Complex Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Aggregate Induced Emission for Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing solution&#8208;processable and stable scintillators with high light yields, low detection limits and high imaging resolutions holds great significance for flexible X&#8209;ray imaging. However, attaining an optimal equilibrium among X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, exciton utilization efficiency, and decay lifetime of scintillators remains a substantial challenge. Here,  a new Cu(I) halide complex was   synthesized  in a mild condition. It exhibits intense blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristic, as well as good water&#8208;oxygen stability and photochemical stability. Notably, the complex shows excellent radiation resistance and efficient radioluminescence (RL) with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 42.5 nGyairs&#8208;1. This superior scintillation performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption by the&#160;heavy Cu2I2 core, the high radiation&#8208;induced exciton utilization rate in TADF process, and the remarkable suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions by the restriction of intramolecular motions in solid state. Furthermore, the favourable solution processability of the complex facilitates the successful fabrication of a flexible film, achieving high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with a resolution of 17.3 lp mm&#8208;1. This work highlights the potential of hybrid Cu(I) halides with AIE&#8208;TADF effects for high&#8208;energy radiation detection and imaging, opening up new avenues for the exploration of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Mechanical Tunnelling Probes with Redox Cycling for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Detection of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum mechanical tunnelling sensors (QMTs) have emerged as a promising technology for next&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule detection.&#160;When QMT sensors are combined with redox species, repeated oxidation and reduction (redox cycling) can also be observed. We developed robust QMT probes with electrode gap distances below 2 nm. Using the generator&#8208;collector (GC) mode, we verified that redox cycling of the ferrocyanide/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63&#8208;/4&#8208;) couple occurs both in the tunnelling regime and on the electrode surface.&#160;Our findings indicated that the current enhancement is affected by both the gap distance and surface modifications of the probes. These QMT probes exhibited remarkable sensitivity, capable of detecting Fe(CN)63&#8208;/4&#8208; concentrations as low as sub&#8208;picomolar levels. Utilising this ability to modulate redox reactions, we adapted the QMT probes to serve as electrochemical sensors for detecting viral proteins. By modifying the electrode surfaces, our functionalised QMT probes achieved sub&#8208;pM detection limits with high selectivity in biofluids such as nasopharyngeal secretions.&#160;These findings highlight the potential of QMT probes to develop into a new class of electrochemical tunnelling sensors, offering significant advancements in biomedical diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Gold Recycling from Electronic Waste Using a Highly Stable Porous Aromatic Framework/Polymer and Its Application for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recycling gold from electronic waste represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy for both resource recovery and waste reduction. In this study, we designed an innovative and highly stable porous aromatic framework&#160;(PAF)/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), as an efficient adsorbent for selective gold recovery for the first time. The maximum gold adsorption capacity of PAF&#8208;147/PDA reached 1700 mg&#183;g&#8315;&#185;. Furthermore, it could rapidly extract over 95% of gold from solutions in a pH range of 0&#8208;10 within just 2 minutes. Importantly, as a real application demonstration, the PAF&#8208;147/PDA composite selectively recovered 99% of gold from the leachate of discarded central processing units. When the recovered Au&#8208;containing composite was applied to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the Faradaic efficiency for CO production exceeded 95% across acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, outperforming most reported gold&#8208;based catalysts due to the cooperation effect of the composite and Au. This work opens a new way for the combination of selective gold recovery from electronic waste with highly efficient CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We quantify the effects of intensely applied electric fields on the Fe oxidation mechanism. The specimen are pristine Fe single crystals exposing a variety of surface structures identified by field ion microscopy. These crystals are simultaneously exposed to low pressures of pure oxygen gas, on the order of 10&#8208;7 mbar, while applying intense electric fields on their surface of several tens of volts per nanometer. The local composition of the different surface structures is probed directly and in real time using an Environmental Atom Probe and successfully compared with first principles&#8208;based models. We found that rough Fe{244} and Fe{112} facets are more reactive toward oxygen than compact Fe{024} and Fe{011} facets. Results demonstrate that the influence of an electric field on the oxidation kinetics depends on the timescales that are involved as the system evolves toward equilibrium. The initial oxidation kinetics show that strong increases in electric fields facilitate the formation of an oxide. However, as one approaches equilibrium, high field values mitigate this formation. Ultimately, this study elucidates how high externally applied electric fields can be utilized to dynamically exploit reaction dynamics at the nanoscale towards desired products in a catalytic reaction at mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Target agnostic photoaffinity labelling by sulfonylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoaffinity labeling is a widely used methodology for interrogating small molecule&#8208;protein interactions. However, these applications are limited by the few photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers that typically modify the affinity and the binding mode of the original ligand. Here, we report the development of new target agnostic photoaffinity warheads, sulfohydrazones that form a reactive carbene upon UV irradiation. Careful optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to effectively label five different amino acid residues in proteins. Our approach turned biologically relevant hydrazones and sulfohydrazones to intrinsically irreversible covalent binders without structural modifications by photoactivation as demonstrated on monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A) enzyme and STAT5b (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b) transcription factor. Sulfohydrazones are readily accessible by transforming the corresponding carbonyl group of a ligand or a suitable tag that extends the application domain of the method for any ligands exemplified by conditional labelling of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme and the oncogenic mutant of GTP&#8208;ase KRasG12D.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Following our report of the first coordination complex between a noble&#8208;gas compound and a crown ether, (CH2CH2O)5XeO3, the reactions and structures of XeO3 complexes with 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 were investigated. The reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with XeO3 in dilute aqueous HF solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8729;2H2O&#8729;HF, whereas reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in acetone solutions with moist solid XeO3 yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8729;H2O. The (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8729;H2O complexes are air&#8208;stable and shock&#8208;insensitive, whereas [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8729;2H2O&#8729;HF is a treacherous, shock&#8208;sensitive detonator. Low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that XeO3 is coordinated to the crown ether and H2O through short Xe&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O contacts. Mappings of the XeO3 Hirshfeld surfaces onto 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8729;H2O reveal regions of negative electrostatic potential (EP) on the oxygen atoms of the crown ethers and regions of high positive EP on the Xe(VI) atom of XeO3 that are consistent with &#963;&#8208;hole bonds. The calculated gas&#8208;phase geometries, Wiberg bond valences and indices, and empirical bond valences corroborate the descriptions of the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Ocrown/H2O contacts as &#963;&#8208;hole bonds. The 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4, 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5, and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 complexes of XeO3 are also compared with the X&#8208;ray crystal structures and calculated gas&#8208;phase structures of their SbF3 and SbCl3 analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>The Substituent&#8208;Effect in NHCP&#8208;Plumbylenes with a Phosphaplumbene Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the use of plumbylene&#8208;phosphinidenes to address the challenge of isolating P=Pb bonds. Herein, we report the synthesis of three N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene phosphinidene (NHCP) substituted chlorotetrylene dimers [(IDipp)PECl]2 (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; IDipp = C([N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)CH]2)). Substituent attachment via salt metathesis (E = Sn, Pb) enables the isolation of NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene (IDipp)PSn(SiTms2SiTol3) as well as NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208; and NHCP&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted plumbylenes (IDipp)PPb(SiTms2SiTol3) and (IDipp)PPb(mTer) (mTer = 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3, Tms = Trimethylsilyl). Access to these structures not only expands this chemistry to the heaviest of group 14 elements but also provides a deeper understanding of the substituent effect on NHCP&#8208;tetrylene bonding. Computational studies demonstrate that both silyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted species exhibit partial multiple bond character, with the silyl&#8208;substituted species showing higher bond orders and reduced polarization. This is further supported by the short P&#8208;E bond lengths observed in their solid&#8208;state structures. Finally, the formal [2+2] cycloaddition of diphenylketene to (IDipp)PPb(mTer) provides experimental evidence for the ability of NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes to serve as synthetic equivalents of P=Pb double bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of Electron Donation onto the Reactants and a Transient Poisoning Mechanism During CO2 Electroreduction on Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SACs&#160;are an important class of materials that mediate chemical reduction reactions, a key subset of which is Ni within a carbon support for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However,&#160;how the metal atom/clusters and&#160;carbon&#8208;based support act in concert to catalyze CO2RR is not well understood, with most reports attributing activity solely to the Ni&#8208;Nx/C moieties. To address this gap, we have undertaken a mechanistic investigation, employing in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with electrochemical studies and DFT calculations to further understand how Ni single atoms work in conjunction with the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix to promote CO2RR to CO, and how the presence of impurities such as those present in CO2&#8208;containing waste flue gases (including NOx, and CN&#8208;) changes the catalyst upon reduction. In contrast to previous works, we do not find strong evidence for a purely metal&#8208;based reduction upon application of negative reductive potentials. Instead, we present evidence for an increase in the equatorial vs. axial splitting of Ni, consistent with electrons moving onto the reactants via the Ni single atom 3dz2 orbital. In addition, we demonstrate a transient poisoning mechanism of the Ni SAC by nitrite and thiocyanate, explaining the recovery of activity during CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a photocatalytic platform to access transient nitrenoids by designing photo&#8208;responsive neutral rhodium&#8208;hydroxamate complexes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and mass spectrometric analysis, suggest that electrophilic Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid intermediates could be generated via photoactivation of corresponding Rh&#8208;hydroxamates via N&#8208;O bond homolysis and redox event.

         <title>Sustainable Pathways for the Synthesis of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium sulfate, and especially its hemihydrate form (bassanite), is crucial in the construction industry, primarily used as a hydraulic binder in cements, mortars, and wallboards. Because of the rapid transformation of bassanite into thermodynamically stable gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) upon contact with water, natural deposits of the hemihydrate are scarce, rendering it one of the most extensively produced inorganic materials worldwide. Currently, bassanite is derived from mined or waste gypsum through a thermal dehydration process, which is energy&#8208;intensive and costly. As sustainability has become a key target for industrial processes and products, a series of studies aiming to increase the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of bassanite production was published recently. Two primary approaches are pursued: conversion of gypsum and direct precipitation of bassanite from solution. In both cases, organic solvents, (specific) additives and/or elevated temperatures have been used to control the activity/availability of water in the reaction medium and thus direct phase selection towards the hemihydrate. This review offers a comprehensive overview of alternative bassanite production methods, critically examining their benefits, potential downsides, and overall impact on the sustainability of industrial&#8208;scale calcium sulfate hemihydrate use.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calcium sulfate, and especially its hemihydrate form (bassanite), is crucial in the construction industry, primarily used as a hydraulic binder in cements, mortars, and wallboards. Because of the rapid transformation of bassanite into thermodynamically stable gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) upon contact with water, natural deposits of the hemihydrate are scarce, rendering it one of the most extensively produced inorganic materials worldwide. Currently, bassanite is derived from mined or waste gypsum through a thermal dehydration process, which is energy-intensive and costly. As sustainability has become a key target for industrial processes and products, a series of studies aiming to increase the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of bassanite production was published recently.

         <title>Large&#8208;area, Ultra&#8208;thin Organic Films with Both Photochromic&#160;and Phosphorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the most commonly used polymers in plastic products. Therefore, endowing these polymers with unique optical properties would significantly enhance their overall technological value. Herein, we synthesized a phosphorescent molecule, 2,2'&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,3'&#8208;bibenzofuran (DBF), with notable reversible photochromic properties (switching between colorless and deep red) as the guest and constructed a doped system with the above polymers as the hosts. All doped materials exhibited both room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and reversible photochromic properties. The guest molecule exhibited strong reversible cyclization activity and small conformational changes during the reaction process, as well as moderate rigidity of the host matrix, which enabled the uncommon coexistence of these two properties in the doped system. Finally, DBF/PET was successfully formed into a transparent and uniform film with a length of 200 m, a width of 20 cm, a thickness of only 60&#8208;70 &#956;m. This film exhibited excellent thermal&#8208;stability, sensitivity, and resistance to photo&#8208;fatigue, indicating its applicability in industrial production.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Fucosylation Enables the Interrogation of the Lea&#8208;LecB Interaction by BioNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis antigen Lea is a selective ligand for Lectin B in P. aeruginosa. Interrogating a key hydrogen bond in this complex has important ramifications for antibiotic research. Through the development of stereoselective fluoro&#8208;fucosylation, it has been possible to design F&#8208;Lea as a structural biology tool. BioNMR analyses with both the native (Lea) and fluorinated (F&#8208;Lea) glycans have unequivocally established the importance of this interaction in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.







Abstract
Fucosylation patterns in cell&#8208;surface glycans are essential mediators of recognition and signalling. Aberrations in these signatures serve as vital diagnostic markers of disease progression, and so understanding fucose&#8208;protein interactions at the molecular level is crucial. Molecular editing of l&#8208;fucose (Fuc) at C2 with fluorine provides a platform to reconcile the ubiquity of fucosylation with the paucity of strategies to interrogate site&#8208;specific interactions. Through judicious introduction of a pseudo&#8208;equatorial fluorine [C(sp3)&#8208;F] adjacent to the anomeric position, &#946;&#8208;selective fucosylation can be achieved with a range of diverse acceptors (&gt;50&#8201;:&#8201;1): the selectivity of this process can be inverted through changes in the donor scaffold. Reaction development was driven by the desire to construct a fluorinated analogue of Lewis antigen a (F&#8208;Lea), in which fluorine replaces a key OH group at C2. Lea is a ligand for Lectin B (LecB) in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and thus delineating the importance of key interactions in this complex has ramifications for drug discovery. Independent syntheses of Lea and F&#8208;Lea, and systematic bioNMR analyses with both glycans has unequivocally established the essential role of O2 of fucose in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Organic Molecules via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free, safe mechanochemical method for hydrogenation and dehalogenation is presented. Using catalyst&#8208;plated vessels and H2 gas, various functional groups are efficiently reduced at ambient conditions. Alkenes and alkynes are fully hydrogenated in 20&#8197;min (&gt;99&#8201;% yield). Carbonyls are converted to alcohols (95&#8211;99&#8201;% yield), while nitro groups are reduced to amines (&gt;95&#8201;% yield). Dehalogenation of chloro&#8208;, bromo&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;compounds proceeds efficiently. Choice of catalyst and reaction conditions enable chemoselective transformations. This versatile approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, recyclable system for hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Mechanochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O, as well as N&#8722;O and C&#8722;X bonds is successfully achieved without the use of solvents, ligands, or catalyst powders via ball milling. A variety of catalysts are electroplated onto the walls of the milling vessel, allowing for simple recycling and reuse of the catalytic material. Hydrogen gas is directly introduced into the milling vessel, eliminating the need for hydrogen donor compounds which contribute to waste production and suboptimal atom economy. This approach enables the quantitative hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, achieving near&#8208;complete conversion within just 20 minutes at ambient temperature and pressures as low as 1.5&#8197;bar. Carbonyls, nitro groups, and organohalides were converted within reaction times of up to 12&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations suggest the reaction to be following established mechanisms for hydrogenation. Finally, chemoselective hydrogenation of various reducible functional groups was explored, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical approach with simple catalyst recycling for hydrogenation reactions.
