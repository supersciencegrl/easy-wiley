         <title>Exploring the Interplay of Lattice Dynamics and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Progress Towards Rational Phonon Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential in flexible, lightweight, and cost&#8208;effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure &#8208;&#8208; termed dynamic disorder &#8208;&#8208; that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low&#8208;frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad phonon spectrum drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance.&#160;In this review, we explore progress towards uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally&#8208;activated phonons. We describe the powerful insight that mode&#8208;resolved analyses of electron&#8208;phonon interactions lends towards the rational design of new materials. We highlight recent efforts to achieve this, showcasing proposed strategies to mitigate dynamic disorder through molecular and crystal design. This work offers an overview of the insight gained towards understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing charge transport in OSCs,&#160;outlining pathways for enhancing performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Mediators for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Element&#160;&#8211;&#160;Carbon Bond Homolysis in Main Group Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinitiated homolysis of element&#8208;carbon bonds is an important method for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals in catalysis and organometallic or polymer chemistry. In this respect, the use of earth&#8208;abundant main group elements such as aluminum or silicon is attractive. Generally, subvalent species derived from these typically redox&#8208;inactive elements are unstable and within their high&#8208;valent configuration +III (Al) or +IV (Si) comparatively strong E&#8211;C bonds are formed. Therefore, E&#8211;C homolysis usually requires short&#8208;wave UV irradiation, which hampers their use as radical sources. Some reports in the literature show that visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#8211;C homolysis is possible when a redox non&#8208;innocent ligand (NIL) is coordinated to the organometallic fragment. In a simplified view, the non&#8208;innocent ligands provide chromophoric moieties, which can absorb energy in form of light and subsequently convert it to break the element&#8208;carbon bonds. The resulting main group element radicals are in turn stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron, effectively lowering the dissociation energy of the E&#8211;C bond. In this article, the effects of non&#8208;innocent ligands as mediators for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#8211;C bond homolysis in main group chemistry are discussed on the basis of selected literature reports, and future opportunities and challenges are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Photometallobiocatalysis: Nonheme Fe&#8208;Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent RadicalDecarboxylative Azidation, Thiocyanation and Isocyanation of Redox&#8208;Active Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative catalysis with an enzyme and a smallmolecule photocatalyst has very recently emerged as a potentially general activation mode to advance novel biocatalytic reactions with synthetic utility. Herein, we report cooperative photobiocatalysis involving an engineered nonheme Fe enzyme and a tailored photoredox catalyst as a unifying strategy for the catalytic enantioconvergent decarboxylative azidation, thiocyanation and isocyanation of redox&#8208;active esters via a radical mechanism. Through the survey and directed evolution of nonheme Fe enzymes, we repurposed and further evolved metapyrocatechase (MPC), a nonheme Fe extradiol dioxygenase not previously studied in new&#8208;tonature biocatalysis, for the enantioselective C&#8211;N3, C&#8211;SCN and C&#8211; NCO bond formation through a radical rebound mechanism with an enzymatic Fe&#8211;X intermediate (X = N3, NCS, and NCO). A range of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radical precursors were effectively converted by our engineered MPC, allowing the syntheses of organic azides, thiocyanates and isocyanates with good to excellent enantiocontrol. Further chemical derivatization of these products furnished valuable compounds. Computational studies via DFT and MD simulations shed light on the mechanism as well as the binding poses of the alkyl radical intermediate in the enzyme active site and the &#960;&#8208;facial selectivity in the enantiodetermining radical rebound.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of First Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer of Water Oxidation at the BiVO4&#8208;Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the BiVO4&#8208;water interface is considered to be the bottleneck of the overall water splitting at this aqueous interface. To provide&#160; insight into the mechanism of this reaction, we focus on the first proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). We obtain the free&#8208;energy surface of this first step by combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly probability enhanced sampling and machine learning potentials at the hybrid functional level of accuracy. Our study reveals that proton transfer precedes electron transfer and determines the reaction barrier, consistent
with kinetic&#8208;isotope&#8208;effect experiments. The calculated reaction barrier amounts to 0.66&#177;0.09&#160;eV. The proton moves from the adsorbed water molecule to a surface O atom through a direct transfer mechanism. The hole hopping to the resulting hydroxide occurs via the mediation of a surface Bi atom. The presented framework can be generally applied to other PCET steps and other oxides, thus opening the door to a comprehensive investigation of the OER mechanism at oxide&#8208;water interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Engineering for Achieving Full&#8208;Color Tunable Emission from Blue to Red and Multi&#8208;Level Information Security in Isomeric Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of novel hybrid metal halides polymorphs with full&#8208;color tunable emission are critical for the advancement of solid&#8208;state lighting and displays technologies. However, it remains challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we successfully synthesized three new zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid isomeric copper (I) halides, namely &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 (where BuPh3P+ = butyltriphenylphosphonium, C22H24P+), featuring the same edge&#8208;sharing [Cu2I4]2&#8722; units. Notably, the monoclinic &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4, both belonging to the P21/n space group, exhibit bright blue and orange emission, respectively. The orthorhombic&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 with space group Pbca and larger lattice volume shows vivid red emission, thus achieving tunable full&#8208;color emission wavelength spanning from blue (445 nm) to red (667 nm), representing the first instance of such broad tunability through adjusting the spatial arrangement of the organic and inorganic parts. Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 undergoes a reversible photo&#8208;induced fluorochromism, transitioning from blue to green. Furthermore, a reversible phase transformation between &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 can be triggered by dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. As such, a photo&#8208;responsive switchable system and multistage information encryption/decryption system are successfully devised through leveraging unique multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitramine Formation via a Cryptic Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetase&#8208;Dependent Strategy in N&#8208;Nitroglycine Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N

nitroglycine (NNG), a rare nitramine natural compound, is the only known example produced by streptomyces strains. In this study, we clarified that NNG biosynthesis originates from glycine and l&#8208;lysine and elucidated its biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) nng. This cluster shares high homology with the recently reported BGCs of diazo compound azaserine. In vivo and in vitro results have indicated NNG biosynthetic pathway involves hydrazine and hydrazone generation, with a non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenase and a cytochrome P450 responsible for forming the nitramine structure. Furthermore, although NNG lacks a serine unit in the structure, its biosynthesis still requires the incorporation of a serine attached to the hydrazone intermediate by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), similar to the azaserine pathway, and two hydrolases are putatively involved in thioester hydrolysis and serine removal, respectively. This study, along with comparisons to azaserine biosynthesis, not only paves the way for the discovery of new nitramine and diazo compounds by genome mining but also highlights the potential for uncovering novel enzymes and chemistry involved in hydrazone oxidation.</dc:description>

nitroglycine (NNG), a rare nitramine natural compound, is the only known example produced by streptomyces strains. In this study, we clarified that NNG biosynthesis originates from glycine and l-lysine and elucidated its biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) nng. This cluster shares high homology with the recently reported BGCs of diazo compound azaserine. In vivo and in vitro results have indicated NNG biosynthetic pathway involves hydrazine and hydrazone generation, with a non-heme diiron N-oxygenase and a cytochrome P450 responsible for forming the nitramine structure. Furthermore, although NNG lacks a serine unit in the structure, its biosynthesis still requires the incorporation of a serine attached to the hydrazone intermediate by non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), similar to the azaserine pathway, and two hydrolases are putatively involved in thioester hydrolysis and serine removal, respectively. This study, along with comparisons to azaserine biosynthesis, not only paves the way for the discovery of new nitramine and diazo compounds by genome mining but also highlights the potential for uncovering novel enzymes and chemistry involved in hydrazone oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Alcohols Enabled by Photocatalytic Radical Brook Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While radical Brook rearrangement has emerged as a powerful strategy in modern organic synthesis, enantioselective cross coupling involving radical Brook rearrangement&#160;remains unexplored. Herein, we report a photocatalytic radical Brook rearrangement followed by cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides, enabling the enantioconvergent construction of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. Key to this transformation is a radical relay process involving sequential generation of aryl cation radicals, alkoxy radicals, and carbon&#8208;centered radicals through Brook rearrangement. The reaction exhibits exceptional scope (&gt;40 examples), outstanding enantiocontrol (up to 99% ee), and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated through formal syntheses of bioactive Odanacatib and LX&#8208;1031, along with diverse downstream derivatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Nanopipette Sensor for Electrochemical Interferent Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;based sensors have been widely utilized for their superior selectivity. However, they cannot distinguish the same kind of redox mediators from different sources. Typically, both the H&#8322;O&#8322; produced in glucose (analyte) oxidation by glucose oxidase (GOD) and the endogenous H&#8322;O&#8322; (interferent) existing in the detection system can be simultaneously measured, causing inaccurate results in glucose detection. To address this long&#8208;standing and inevitable obstacle, we proposed a new sensor design strategy, a dual&#8208;interface nanopipette sensor (DINS), to shield against the interferent electrochemically. The DINS comprised an anti&#8208;interference interface at the orifice of the nanopipette, and a sensing interface located at the inner wall with a certain distance from the orifice. Anti&#8208;interference interface, functioning as an &#8220;electrochemical Faraday cage&#8221;, electrochemically eliminated the interferents with high efficiency while allowed the target species to pass through and be detected at the sensing interface. With the synergy of these two independent interfaces, the GOD&#8208;modified DINS (GOD&#8208;DINS) allowed the accurate detection of intracellular glucose with effectively eliminating endogenous H&#8322;O&#8322;, facilitating the quantitative study on the glucose metabolism inside single cells. Furthermore, this DINS configuration is expected to accurately quantify more substances, and reveal complex crosstalk interactions between multiple species in the physiological, pathological and pharmacological research.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Multipath Proton Transmembrane Transport System with Redox&#8208;Switchable Characteristics for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural channel proteins (NCPs) enable efficient and selective transport of specific species across cellular membranes and exhibit stimulus&#8208;responsive behaviors; however, replicating these features in their artificial counterparts poses significant challenges. Here we report a hyperbranched polymer (HBP)&#8208;derived biomimetic multipath proton transport system, H3, by a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; cationic polymerization of 3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;oxetane. H3 efficiently transports protons while rejecting other ions and water molecules by forming multiple hydrogen bonding chains like natural proton channels. Patch clamp experiments revealed that H3 facilitates rapid proton transport (&#947;H+ = 181 &#177; 4 pS) comparable to that of natural gramicidin A (&#947;H+ = &#160;213 &#177; 4 pS) and demonstrates high H+&#8208;selectivity, with PH+/PK+, PH+/PNa+, and PH+/PCl&#8208; values reaching 78.4, 233.2, and 167.8, respectively. H3&#8208;induced proton transport causes elevated lysosomal pH and mitochondrial damage, ultimately resulting in severe cancer cell apoptosis (IC50: 0.23 &#956;M for U87MG; 1.04 &#956;M for B16F10). Interestingly, selenide moieties&#8208;containing H3&#8208;Se exhibits an unprecedented in situ redox&#8208;switchable &#8220;ON&#8208;OFF&#8221; of proton transport by regulating its hydrophilicity. This work will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of NCPs and treatments for cancer and other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Lattice&#8208;Coherent Surface Enabling Superior Mechanical Integrity for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode is pushing LiCoO2 towards 4.6 V operation. However, the structural and interfacial instability of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 is exacerbated when the charging cut&#8208;off voltage exceeds 4.55 V, resulting in severe mechanical failure and subsequent dramatic capacity decay. Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co&#8208;containing Li&#8208;rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO2 surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2. Through establishing the lattice&#8208;coherent Li&#8208;rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li&#8208;rich phase endows LiCoO2 with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6 V and even at 4.7 V. This work taps into a new avenue of surface engineering on high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric B&#8592;N Functionalized Benzothiadiazoles for High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B&#8592;N containing polymers have emerged in organic electronics due to their fascinating optical and electronic properties. Despite these advantages, the development of B&#8592;N&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers for high&#8208;performance organic transistors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective B&#8592;N containing acceptor units. In this work, we address this challenge through the rational design and synthesis of two asymmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives, BTBN and FBTBN. These compounds leverage the unique electronic properties of the B&#8592;N motif, enabling the development of two new n&#8208;type polymers, PBTBN and PFBTBN. Notably, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBTBN and PFBTBN are significantly lowered by 0.2~0.3 eV compared to their counterparts without B&#8592;N functionalization, with PFBTBN achieving a LUMO of ~ &#8211;4.0 eV. Importantly, PFBTBN exhibits exceptional unipolar n&#8208;type transistor performance with a high electron mobility (&#956;e) of 3.85 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The asymmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N molecular backbone not only stabilizes the electronic structure but also induces a near&#8208;amorphous morphology, thereby enabling PFBTBN&#8208;based flexible transistors to retain a high &#956;e of 3.16 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 even after 1000 bending cycles. This work demonstrates the transformative potential of incorporating asymmetric B&#8592;N functionalized acceptors for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is a key issue limiting the practical application of potassium metal batteries. Herein, a novel high&#8208;entropy SEI layer rich in inorganic components is designed and constructed via in situ electrochemical conversion of the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 interfacial layer on a porous scaffold. Theoretical studies and experimental techniques reveal that the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 heterostructure, with its low work function and weak Sn&#8722;O/S bond, significantly enhances reactivity with the electrolyte, thereby facilitating the in situ formation of the high&#8208;entropy SEI layer. The in situ generated high&#8208;entropy SEI exhibits low surface roughness, low surface potential, fast potassium ion transport characteristics, and excellent mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 20.08 GPa). Leveraging these advantageous properties of the high&#8208;entropy SEI, the resulting potassium metal anode achieves an excellent rate performance up to 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells and demonstrates outstanding cycling stability for 2500 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. When paired with a perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode, the potassium metal full battery retains 81.6% of its capacity over 1650 cycles at 10 C. This work underscores a straightforward and effective approach for the establishment of a stable interphase on metallic potassium anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroenergy Inspiring Large&#8208;Scale Piezoelectric Catalysis for Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The piezoelectric&#160;effect presents a promising avenue for harvesting and utilizing low&#8208;grade&#160;mechanical energy. However, challenges from lacking&#160;matched industrial&#160;equipment&#160;and maintaining catalytic performance during&#160;scaling up impede&#160;the engineering of&#160;piezo&#8208;catalysis. Here, utilizing mechanical energy of&#160;water to inspire&#160;piezoelectricity,&#160;a&#160;successful&#160;attempt to&#160;large&#8208;scale piezo&#8208;catalysis&#160;seawater H2&#160;evolution&#160;was reported&#160;for the first time, exhibiting an efficiency of 36.82% for converting mechanical energy&#160;to hydrogen energy. A&#160;scaling up test&#160;with 20 L seawater was conducted, yielding a H2&#160;production rate of 0.73 L/h&#160;which just occupying 0.7 m2. This performance (1.04 L/h/m2) exceeding the large&#8208;scale&#160;photocatalytic pure water H2&#160;production by&#160;panel reactor&#160;array&#160;(0.18~0.25 L/h/m2) reported in 2021[1]. Additionally, the H2&#160;evolution&#160;activity of the 20 L system showed no obvious decline compared with&#160;the 50 mL system&#160;before scaled&#8208;up, owing to the utilization&#160;of ternary piezo&#8208;catalysts&#160;system, which&#160;capitalized on the synergistic coupling effect of kinetics&#160;and thermodynamics. This attempt provides a prototype for pursuing&#160;large&#8208;scale piezo&#8208;catalysis and practical&#160;engineering application.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyl Spillover Activated from the Strongly Coupled Ru@Mn3O4 Heterostructure to Promote Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH* desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH* desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn3O4, in which Ru clusters&#160;are decorated on Mn3O4 via Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn3O4 facilitates the water dissociation, while the formed hetero&#8208;interface can efficiently desorb OH* via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn3O4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8211;1, surpassing recently reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn3O4 increase about 11 and 8&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect, and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Completing the Biosynthesis of the Clinically Important Diterpenoid Andrographolide in Andrographis paniculata</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Andrographolide is a prominent labdane diterpenoid extracted from Andrographis paniculata, celebrated for its exceptional anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Commercial production of andrographolide relies exclusively on extraction from plant resources. Although the scaffold of andrographolide referring to ent&#8208;copalol has previously been biosynthesized, further oxidative modifications remain elusive. In this study, by taking an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes approach, we were able to identify four cytochrome P450 enzymes constituting the minimal set of andrographolide biosynthetic genes. Specifically, ApCYP71D587 catalyzes the conversion of ent&#8208;copalol to 19&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ent&#8208;copalol. Subsequently, ApCYP71BE50 mediates the formation of the lactone ring, ultimately yielding andrograpanin. Then ApCYP706U5 accomplishes the third step by mediating the C&#8208;3 hydroxylation reaction, thereby allowing the formation of 14&#8208;deoxyandrographolide. Ultimately, ApCYP72F1 completes the biosynthetic generation of andrographolide with C&#8208;14 hydroxylation of the lactone and rearrangement of the olefin bond. In addition, co&#8208;expression of the minimal gene set in N. benthamiana engineered to produce ent&#8208;copalol feasibly produces andrographolide, thus establishing an innovative metabolic engineering strategy to produce this medicine of historical importance, circumventing the need for plant extraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Aziridination of Allylic Carbamates using Ion&#8208;Paired Rhodium Complexes and Extrapolation to C&#8208;H Amination of Phenethyl Carbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aziridination of alkenes is an important route to chiral nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks. Here we report that carbamate&#8208;functionalized allylic alcohols undergo highly enantioselective aziridination using achiral dimeric Rh(II,II) complexes that are ion&#8208;paired with cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived chiral cations. The aziridine&#8208;containing products are amenable to a variety of further reactions to generate useful groupings of functionality. Furthermore, we show that the carbamate group is effective for directing highly enantioselective benzylic C&#8208;H amination when it is appended to phenethyl alcohols. Intermolecular C&#8208;H amination of phenethyl alcohol derivatives has proven highly challenging to achieve asymmetrically yet gives rise to valuable &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Both processes result in rapid access to versatile, highly enantioenriched small molecule building blocks for synthesis and highlight the effectiveness and generality of this chiral cation&#8208;based strategy for asymmetric catalysis. We report studies that probe important structural features of the chiral cation and demonstrate that the ion&#8208;paired complexes can be formed from their individual components without a separate isolation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization of L&#8208;Cysteine in Heavy Water Induces Intrinsic Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing non&#8208;invasive techniques that can probe how solvents modulate the nucleation pathways of bioorganic molecules in solution remains an active and open area of research. Herein, we investigate the crystallization of the amino acid L&#8208;Cysteine and show that both the structure of the crystal and its intrinsic fluorescence can be drastically altered by solvent isotope effects. Crystals formed in heavy water exhibit markedly different intermolecular packing as well as strikingly different monomer conformations compared to those in light water. Remarkably, these differences in the supramolecular packing result in significantly elevated intrinsic fluorescence in the crystal that is formed in heavy water. Using a combination of experimental techniques and advanced electronic structure approaches, we elucidate the molecular interactions within the crystals that govern both the electronic origins and the intensity of their emission. These findings demonstrate how tuning the solvent by changing its isotope leads to the emergence of design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores that could serve as novel sensing probes for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Core&#8208;Shell Structured Argyrodite&#8208;Type Electrolyte Enabling Elevated Chemical/Electrochemical Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate architecture integrating argyrodite core with LiCl shell was constructed by means of the specific surface engineering strategy, aiming to elevate all&#8208;round performances of sulfide solid electrolyte. Combined with the compatible electrolyte/electrode interface, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cell retains remarkable electrochemical performances. This surface engineering strategy paves the way towards an advanced and practical level in the field of sulfide&#8208;based solid electrolytes.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes hold great promise in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries owing to high ionic conductivity and good formability. However, their poor chemical/electrochemical stability imposes limitations on further large&#8208;scale application. In this study, a versatile solid electrolyte (SE) is finely crafted with the core of Cl&#8208;gradient argyrodite structure and the shell of LiCl layer. Leveraging LiCl shell as a &#8220;reservoir&#8221;, this argyrodite SE preserves the structure integrity and good Li+ conduction upon air exposure, exhibiting remarkable chemical stability. Moreover, Li+ transport from argyrodite bulk and grain boundary is synergistically enhanced through the specific surface engineering strategy, resulting in an exceptionally high ionic conductivity of 10.62&#160;mS cm&#8722;1. The LiCl shell, characterized by favorable electron shielding and lithiophobicity, enables the core&#8208;shell argyrodite with impressive electrochemical stability over a wide voltage range (0&#8211;5&#160;V versus Li/Li+) and good match for Li metal. As the electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility is optimized by engineering LiCl layer on SE, LiCoO2 cathode paired with the modified SE retains a remarkable capacity retention of 95.6% over 500 cycles at 1&#160;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Efficiency Through Precision Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8208;acceptor 3D COFs synthesized via Schiff base reactions were integrated into perovskite solar cells&#8217; SAMs. Their architecture enabled efficient charge separation, stable interfacial anchoring, and optimized energy alignment, enhancing hole transport and perovskite quality and reduced defect density. This achieving PCEs up to 25.20%, demonstrating COFs' potential in advancing PSC efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of porous polymers with tunable 2D or 3D structures, have drawn significant attention for their exceptional versatility across various applications. Recently, the integration of COFs into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address critical challenges, such as instability, interfacial recombination losses, and lead&#8208;associated environmental risks. Enhanced charge transport channels, passivation of defects, and customizable molecule architectures are some of the special benefits that COFs offer. In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self&#8208;assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect&#8208;assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP&#8208;BE) and 24.21% (DP&#8208;DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.

         <title>Machine Learning Reveals In&#8208;Cavity Versus Surface Activity for Selective C&#9472;H Borylation by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of 45 general descriptors was developed to capture the diverse structural features of a wide range of MOFs, enabling the study of MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for C&#9472;H borylation. This analysis revealed key factors that govern sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, allowing for the rational design of Ni catalysts with up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an expansive and tunable platform for heterogeneous catalysis, yet distinguishing between catalytic reactions occurring within their pores and those on their external surfaces remains a challenge. This study employs interpretable machine learning to elucidate structure&#8208;activity relationships in MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for selective sp3 and sp2 C&#9472;H borylation. By analyzing over 470&#160;000 MOF structures, we developed a set of 45 concise and chemically meaningful descriptors that capture key structural variations across MOFs. These descriptors enabled us to identify the critical factors governing sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, revealing distinct activation mechanisms: sp3 C&#9472;H borylation preferentially occurs within MOF cavities via a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, whereas sp2 C&#9472;H borylation is associated with surface or defect sites, favoring a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) pathway. Guided by these insights, we designed Ni catalysts that achieve up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity. This work provides a systematic framework for rational catalyst design and establishes generalizable principles for controlling activity preference in MOF&#8208;supported catalysis.

         <title>Water Serving as Cocatalyst for the Highly Efficient Homogeneously Catalyzed Conversion of N2O/H2 Mixtures with Optimized Rhodium NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Feeling thirsty? A highly active rhodium olefin&#8211;amine carbene catalyst enables water&#8208;assisted, autocatalytic N&#8322;O hydrogenation. The increased &#960;&#8208;acidity of the NHC enhances the acidity of the cooperative ligand, improving catalytic efficiency. A unique dimeric [Rh]&#8322;[H&#8323;O&#8322;]&#8315; complex was identified, with structural analysis and DFT calculations revealing the efficient release of N&#8322; and water.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a valuable oxygen/nitrogen transfer reagent but reactions with N2O are challenging due to its inertness. Consequently, it accumulates in the atmosphere, and because it is both an ozone&#8208;depleting reagent and potent green&#8208;house gas, effective mitigation methods become important. This study presents rhodium(I) amido bis(olefin) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes [Rh(trop2N)(NHC)] as robust homogeneous catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of N2O. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations show that increasing &#960;&#8208;acidity of the NHC and the presence of water significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency. The rhodium&#8208;amido bond facilitates cooperative H2&#8208;cleavage and oxygen atom transfer from N2O. The catalyst is regenerated with the loss of water from the hydroxide intermediate [Rh(OH)(trop2NH)(NHC)], which forms a dimeric complex with a central bridging hydrated hydroxide ligand [H3O2]&#8722;. Water facilitates dinitrogen (N2) loss from an intermediate containing an oxy&#8208;diazene ligand [H&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;O]&#8722;. The optimized catalyst achieves a TON&#160;&gt;&#160;230&#160;000 and TOF&#160;&gt;&#160;1300 h&#8722;1.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Direct Observation of Cyclo&#8208;Pentazolate Anion Decomposition in a Tailored Molecular Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular cage was designed to trap cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;, a highly unstable anion, through collective weak interactions, as reported by Ming Liu et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202501187). By intentionally avoiding strong interactions, the cage effectively preserved the aromaticity of cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;, while its decomposition was directly monitored via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

   href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202501187"&gt;e202501187&lt;/a&gt;). By intentionally avoiding strong interactions, the cage effectively preserved the aromaticity of cyclo-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#713;, while its decomposition was directly monitored via single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Dysprosium cyclopentadienide is a single&#8208;molecule magnet. Like other organometallic compounds, it is highly sensitive to moisture and oxygen. Encapsulating it in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes protects it from decomposition by environmental water or oxygen and maintains its magnetic character, as reported by Haitao Zhang, Yoji Horii, Masahiro Yamashita et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503979).

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Modulated High&#8208;Spin Localized Cobalt Sites Enhance Catalytic Ozonation for Efficient Odor Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic ozonation technology is crucial for environmental remediation due to its exceptional efficiency and capability for complete mineralization of organic pollutants. However, hindered by  spin&#8208;forbidden transitions, effective catalytic ozonation remains contingent upon the electronic properties and interfacial interactions of the catalyst. Recent studies identify interfacial atomic metal&#8208;oxygen species (M&#8208;*O) as a key descriptor in catalytic ozonation, determining the derivation of reactive species and subsequent reactivity. Herein, we modulated the high&#8208;spin localized Co active sites in HE&#8208;Co3O4 via a high&#8208;entropy strategy, which selectively stabilizes Co&#8208;*O surface species, thereby enhancing catalytic ozonation efficiency. HE&#8208;Co3O4 exhibits a 5&#8208;fold higher degradation rate than Co3O4 for 50 ppm CH3SH elimination (63&#8208;fold the mass activity compared to commercial MnO2) while maintaining exceptional stability over 24 h at 298 K. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetization hysteresis (M&#8208;H) measurements confirm the transition of Co3+ to high&#8208;spin states in HE&#8208;Co3O4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that unpaired electrons enhance the hybridization of Co 3d with O 2p orbitals, thereby establishing a Co&#8208;*O mediated interfacial pathway. This mechanism is directly observed through in situ Raman spectroscopy. These findings provide insights into the targeted modulation of catalyst electronic structures for ozone&#8208;catalyzed environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Control of Active Site Configurations in High&#8208;entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), composed of five or more elements in similar proportions, exhibit unique physicochemical properties, but their disordered atomic structures pose challenges in the precise control of active sites. In contrast, high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds (HEIs), with an ordered atomic arrangement and well&#8208;defined atomic positions, provide clear active site configurations, making them particularly advantageous for complex electrocatalytic reactions like the nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR). Herein, we present the FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI with precisely controlled elemental distributions, leading to the formation of distinct active sites. The FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI catalyst exhibits high activity for NITRR, achieving a high NH3 yield rate of 7.5 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.4 V and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.6% at &#8208;0.30 V, along with excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that Co sites act as key active sites, while Fe and Ni atoms contribute a synergistic effect. Additionally, the FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI catalyst functions in a bifunctional system coupling NH3 production with the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), achieving an NH3 yield of 9.8 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at 1.8 V, maintaining stable performance for 100 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Nano to Micron: Architectural Engineering of Supramolecular Bottlebrushes for Extensively Tunable Structures and Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer greater architectural adaptability than covalent BBCPs. However, the dynamic nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions hinders precise control over their chain architecture, resulting in poorly controlled self&#8208;assembly, unpredictable morphologies, and limited utility. Herein, we introduce a novel molecular design for amphiphilic supramolecular BBCPs that overcomes key challenges in the field. The resulting materials exhibit superior thermodynamic stability in weakly polar solvents. This enables the first demonstration of well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular surfactants within a complex emulsion system, leading to the formation of photonic supraballs with homogenous porous structures. Critically, precise chain architectural engineering enables pore diameter tuning over an unprecedented nanometer&#8208;to&#8208;micrometer range (67 nm&#8208;1.92 &#181;m), significantly surpassing the maximum domain sizes achievable with self&#8208;assembled covalent BBCPs. This extends the photonic bandgap into the mid&#8208;wave infrared range, paving the way for next&#8208;generation materials with potential applications in thermal management.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Uniform Phase Structure for Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Processed Binary Organic Solar Cells with 20.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition has become a facile and promising method to fabricate highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). However, characterization and optimization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) morphology remain a grand challenge for LBL&#8208;processed active layer, and their correlation with photovoltaic properties of OSC devices is not clear to date. Here, to address this issue, the morphology and its formation mechanisms of LBL processed active layer based on the classical D18/L8&#8208;BO blend were investigated systematically. Intriguingly, a unique 3D nanomorphology is achieved and uncovered within the LBL processed active layer, which highlights a highly uniform and &#8220;zigzag&#8221;&#8208;shaped phase structure formed by the intersecting of donor and acceptor aggregates along horizontal direction in the middle&#8208;depth layer, rarely found in BHJ films processed by blend casting. Our results revealed that solid additive DBM with a twisted conformation plays a crucial role in achieving the uniform phase structure of LBL&#8208;deposited active layer. Consequently, the characteristic 3D morphology of LBL processed device significantly improves short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, enabling an impressive PCE of 20.2% in such binary device. Therefore, this work unambiguously demonstrates a unique 3D nanomorphology within LBL active layer, unveils the morphology manipulation mechanism and their correlation with optoelectronic properties of OSCs</dc:description>

         <title>2D/2D MOF/MXene Schottky Junction: Prolonged Carrier Lifetime and Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing sunlight for photocatalytic overall water splitting offers a sustainable approach to renewable hydrogen production, addressing global energy and environmental challenges. However, the development of efficient and durable photocatalysts remains a significant obstacle. This study introduces the design and performance of a 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction composed of Cu2[CuTCPP] MOF of nanometric size and exfoliated Ti3C2 MXene for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting. By leveraging the extensive interfacial contact between the two components, an interfacial electric field is generated, promoting efficient charge migration and prolonging carrier lifetimes, as confirmed through systematic density functional theory simulations, in situ irradiation X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Ti3C2 MXene, acting as a cocatalyst for photohole transport and accumulation, reduces oxidative degradation and slows catalyst deactivation. The synergistically enhanced light absorption properties of the Cu2[CuTCPP]/Ti3C2 heterojunction result in an impressive H2 evolution rate exceeding 5000 &#956;mol gcat&#8722;1, underscoring its potential for next&#8208;generation photocatalytic systems in renewable energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Regiodivergent Reductive Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Coupling by Nickel Catalysis: Sorting Different Alkyl&#8208;Nickel Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective and divergent functionalizations on saturated alkyl chain at specific unfunctionalized positions is a key challenge in organic chemistry and other related areas and offers unprecedented synthetic opportunities. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective and divergent alkyl&#8208;alkyl reductive coupling between two different alkyl halides has been developed. Notably, the reaction finely tunes and recognizes thermodynamic favored &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals over &#946;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, and distal ipso&#8208;alkyl radicals to deliver chemo&#8208; and position&#8208;selective alkylation of unactivated &#945;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;H of amines under reductive conditions. Moreover, the reaction selectively functionalizes one alkyl chain over two migratable alkyl chains. By just switching the catalytic parameters, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of saturated C&#8208;H bonds, and ipso&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling allow for rapid access to three types of branched aliphatic amine architectures from identical starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking as Electron&#8208;Transfer Channels in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis provides a promising approach to produce green energy, by which the intermittent solar energy can be converted into storable chemical energy. Well&#8208;known that the electron transfer rate has great influence on the photocatalytic efficiency. Revealing the influence of electron transfer rate on the photocatalytic efficiency from a molecular level is of great significance but challenge. Herein, we give solid evidence to show that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking can serve as an electron transfer channel to boost photocatalysis. Specifically, two hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with similar structures but slightly different intermolecular interactions have been weaved. Interestingly, the HOF with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions shows much higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution than the one without. Further structural and spectroscopic analyses revealed that the much&#8208;enhanced photocatalytic activity of the former can be attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which can really serve as an electron transfer channel, thus accelerating the electron transfer and achieving a remarkably enhanced activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The work, from a molecular level, reveals the role of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in photocatalysis and gives new insights into the electron transfer in photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Lipid Metabolism Dynamics in Physiological/Pathological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dysregulated lipid metabolism plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. However, due to the lack of effective solutions, the dynamic monitoring and deep understanding of lipid metabolism in the progression of diseases has remained challenging. Herein, a polarity&#8208;sensitive, lipid droplets (LDs)&#8208;targeted probe was developed via molecular surgery for spatiotemporal super&#8208;resolution imaging of lipid metabolism dynamics. Based on the stimulated emission depletion (STED) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) platform, we achieved the super&#8208;resolution visualization and dynamic tracking of the nonlinear fusion and expansion mechanisms of LDs in orthotopic pathology models&#8212;an unprecedented achievement in the field. We also analyzed lipid distribution in zebrafish models using the STED&#8208;FLIM platform to capture lipid metabolism at the organismal level. Crucially, based on the integrated STED&#8208;FLIM platform, this probe accurately monitors lipid metabolism in cellular and pathological tissue contexts of atherosclerosis and fatty liver. This breakthrough provides novel insights for diagnosing lipid metabolism&#8208;related diseases and advancing therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Self&#8208;healing Protective Layer Enabling Stable Zinc Ion Batteries Through Strong Zn&#8208;S Affinity and Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely regarded as the ideal candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, Zn metal anode has long faced challenges, such as: hydrogen evolution reaction, dendrite growth, surface corrosion. Herein, we report the development of a self&#8208;healable and strongly adhesive polymer protective layer for AZIBs, which is achieved by polymerizing a natural small molecule, thioctic acid (TA) on Zn surface. Thanks to the strong and spontaneous affinity between Zn metal surface and S atoms on polymer chains, this polymer protective layer can firmly and dynamically adhere to the Zn surface. Thus, even at a thickness of only &lt;1 &#956;m, the protective layer can exhibit a strong adhesion force of up to 10.5 N with Zn surface, while the abundant carboxyl groups in protective layer can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, endowing its high self&#8208;healing property and enhancing its strength. Such a protective layer&#160;effectively inhibits the dendrite growth physically,&#160;regulates the Zn2+ migration and deposition behavior chemically. Therefore, the symmetric cells can be cycled for ~1000 h at the current density of 1.0 mA cm&#8208;2 and 5.0 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. The full cells with NH4V4O10 can also run stably for 1000 cycles with a high capacity retention.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polyanions as Effective Interphase Layers for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) driven by host&#8208;guest interactions have seen considerable advancements over the past decade, but the guest species involved are predominantly neutral molecules or cations. Strong and dependable macrocycle&#8208;anion interactions for supramolecular polymerization are highly sought after, yet the functionalities of this class of SPs featuring negatively charged backbones remain largely unexplored. Here we report a novel host&#8208;guest interaction between one tetraurea macrocycle and two organophosphate anions with high affinity (association constant Ka = 1.06 &#215; 109 M&#8722;2). It can serve as noncovalent joints to efficiently link low&#8208;molecular&#8208;mass polyethylene oxide (PEO) diorganophosphates into long linear SPs. Being used as an interphase layer in anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries, the polymer material promotes Li+ absorption and desolvation through electrostatic attractions, and enables fast Li+ transport by the alternatingly arranged anionic linkages and PEO units in the polymer main chain. As a result, the SP layer homogenizes Li+ flux to achieve uniform Li deposition, and significantly improves the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 full batteries by a factor of 285% with cycling stability over 200 cycles. These findings pave the way for a new family of anion&#8208;based SPs with tunable architectures and compositions, and suggest their promising applications in future batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright and Fast&#8208;response Hybrid X&#8208;ray Scintillators by Molecular and Dielectric Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators featuring bright and fast&#8208;response properties are essential for high&#8208;speed and dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging. Nevertheless, simultaneously possessing high light yields and fast response remains a significant challenge for most scintillators. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve the bright and fast&#8208;response characteristics of scintillators by leveraging the combined effects of dielectric and molecular confinement in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators (TPA)2MnBr4. Thereinto, large tetrapropylammonium cations (TPA+) surround [MnBr4]2&#8722; units, forming a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) molecular confinement structure that promotes electron localization and achieves a notable light yield of 56800 photons MeV&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the low dielectric constant of TPA+ can enhance dielectric confinement of [MnBr4]2&#8722; units, mitigating exciton capture by deep defects. These synergistic effects in the scintillators lead to a large exciton binding energy of 1028.8 meV and an ultrafast response time of 500 fs. Notably, under the irradiation of X&#8208;rays, (TPA)2MnBr4 exhibits an extremely low detection limit of 18.7 nGyair s&#8722;1 and an exceptional spatial resolution of 21.0 lp mm&#8722;1. Given the bright and fast&#8208;response features of scintillators, we demonstrate the potential applications in 3D dynamic and real&#8208;time X&#8208;ray imaging. These findings lay the groundwork for designing high&#8208;performance scintillators and open avenues for innovative applications in high&#8208;resolution and dynamic imaging</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) of bismuth oxychloride with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield after photocatalytic N2 reduction under solar light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to overcome confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect, leading to &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing their transfer path from (001) to (101) crystal plane. As a result, a new nitrogen reduction pathway with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation is found, as reported by Wen Liu et&#160;al. (e202503097).

         <title>Crystallization/Precipitation Driven Non&#8208;equilibrium Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Thiovalerolactone toward Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable Polythioester with Excellent Barrier Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers with comparable performances with commodity plastics remains as a challenge to establish a circular plastic economy. In this contribution, we propose a&#160;precipitation/crystallization driven non&#8208;equilibrium ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;thiovalerolactone (&#948;TVL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PTVL in the presence of a strong base/urea binary catalyst. The obtained PTVL exhibits good thermal and mechanical performances as well as superior barrier properties comparable with some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained PTVL can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a high yield and purity by distillation from a commodity plastic waste mixture without tedious separation, highlighting its great potential as a closed&#8208;loop recyclable packaging material.</dc:description>

Efficient near infrared (NIR) luminescence is highly important for modern optoelectronic fields. In their Research Article (e202505322), Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers fabricated new types of NIR optical waveguides based on transparent rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses using a facile self&#8208;assembly process. This work provides a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence sensitized lanthanide strategy to synthesize molecular glasses with color&#8208;tunable NIR luminescence and extends the function of NIR optical waveguiding into advanced photonic communications.

         <title>Xanthopinacol Boronate: A Robust, Photochemically Assembled and Cleavable Boronic Ester for Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xanthopinacol (xpin) boronates are a conceptually new class of masked boronic acids designed to alleviate many of the disadvantages of pinacol esters and other popular adducts. They can be formed directly from xanthone and UV light, undergo orthogonal transformations, and are cleavable under photoredox catalysis or oxidative conditions that recycle xanthone to prevent the re&#8208;esterification and facilitate the isolation of the boronic acid.








Abstract
Organoboronic acids impact numerous fields of application from organic synthesis to drug discovery and materials science. However, their highly polar nature makes them challenging to handle, purify, and characterize. Boronic esters help overcome these issues, and pinacol esters (Bpin) have become the dominant boronic acid surrogate in organic synthesis. Despite its popularity, Bpin is not without drawbacks. Its formation from pinacol is intrinsically reversible in the presence of water or alcohols, which may cause premature release leading to losses during reactions and purification. This reversibility complicates the hydrolytic regeneration of free boronic acids, which often requires additional steps to destroy the pinacol by&#8208;product. Although other boronyl protecting groups exist, their removal requires harsh pH conditions. To address these issues, we developed xanthopinacol boronates (Bxpin), a robust protecting group for boronic acids with excellent orthogonality in various chemical reactions and mild irreversible removal under catalyzed photoredox conditions. Xpin boronates can be obtained directly by irradiation of a mixture of free boronic acid and xanthone with UV light, causing an in situ dimerization of xanthone to the required xanthopinacol. The unique attributes of xpin boronates were further studied by UV&#8211;vis spectrophotometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and various stability tests.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides Catalyze Rate&#8208;Determining Redox in Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals how entropy regulates sulfur utilization and cycling stability in aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries. High&#8208;entropy (HES) catalysts enable optimized Zn&#8211;S redox pathways and structural integrity, achieving high sulfur utilization and stable cycling. In contrast, low&#8208; (LES) and medium&#8208;entropy (MES) catalysts show inefficient reactions with by&#8208;product formation and Mn/Co leaching, degrading performance. Practical validation demonstrates HES&#8208;based pouch cells maintain exceptional stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with merely 0.06% capacity decay per cycle, establishing entropy engineering as a practical design strategy. 








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8211;solid Zn&#8211;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional low&#8208;entropy catalysts suffer from poor stability, leading to leaching effects and water splitting during cycling. To overcome these limitations, we present a three&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8211;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS2 to wurtzite ZnS. Furthermore, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. In contrast, utilizing medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy catalysts results in the formation of by&#8208;products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Consequently, the pouch cell with the HES catalysts delivers a high cathode energy density of 313&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high cycling stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. This entropy&#8208;driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Functional Polyacetals via Controlled Cascade Enyne Metathesis Polymerization: Tunable Degradability, Postpolymerization Modification, and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a versatile platform to access functional polyacetals from stereochemically defined monomers. The polymerization exhibited living character and broad functional group tolerance. Rational monomer design enabled tunable hydrolysis rate and photodegradability. Polymer structures were elaborated by postpolymerization modification, preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers and amphiphilic copolymers capable of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We present a versatile platform for the synthesis of functional polyacetals from sugar and furfuryl alcohol derivatives using controlled cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. A range of monomers with defined stereochemistry were explored that featured broad functional group tolerance. The polymerization showed living character and permitted preparation of functionalized polyacetals with targetable molecular weights and more complex architectures. In addition, by harnessing the chiral nature of starting materials, the method granted facile access to chiral polyacetals. Modulation of regiochemical and substituent factors around the acetal motif conferred tunable hydrolysis rate, as well as photodegradability when installed with an ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl group. The polymer structure was further elaborated by postpolymerization modification via leveraging the reactivity of suitable pendent groups and preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers via graft&#8208;through polymerization. Further utilities of the method were showcased by the preparation of amphiphilic copolymers with complete degradability that exhibited self&#8208;assembly behaviors through copolymerization.

         <title>6H&#8208;Intermediate Phase Enabled Slow Crystal Growth of Tin Halide Perovskites for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

We controlled the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. High&#8208;quality FASnI2Br perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects, which resulted in an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000&#8197;lux.







Abstract
The rapid expansion of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) has driven significant advancements in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which provide power to wireless IoT devices. Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have garnered significant attention for IPVs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties without the environmental risks of lead exposure. However, THPs face challenges in controlling their fast crystallization process. Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H&#8208;intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br&#8208;4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase formation. Thus, high&#8208;quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs.

         <title>Diacylation of Peptides Enables the Construction of Functional Vesicles for Drug&#8208;Carrying Liposomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here we show that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized functional vesicles. The use of integrin&#8208;binding peptide motifs as head groups enables the construction of drug&#8208;carrying liposomes that are specifically taken up by cells.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells by enzymatic diacylation of non&#8208;amphiphilic polar head groups. Analogous non&#8208;enzymatic processes may have been relevant at the origin of life and could have practical utility in membrane synthesis. However, aqueous head group diacylation is challenging in the absence of enzymes. The use of charged peptides instead of canonical phospholipid head groups offers advantages with respect to ease of acylation and chemical diversity. Here we demonstrate that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables in situ synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized vesicles resembling cellular membranes. Diacylation occurs between non&#8208;amphiphilic peptides possessing an N&#8208;terminal cysteine, and acyl thioesters. Peptide head groups endow unique membrane functions, which is demonstrated by incorporation of an arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) motif, resulting in vesicle targeting to &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. The biocompatibility and functional group programmability of D&#8208;ALPs supports their broad utility as membrane mimetics.

         <title>Formation of the Diketopiperazine Moiety by a Distinct Condensation&#8208;Like Domain in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of structural biology, genetics, biochemistry, and computational chemistry revealed a specific mechanism by which a CT domain with the &#8220;PW&#215;&#215;&#215;DG&#8221; motif stabilizes an amidate intermediate through a protonated arginine residue R2776 outside the motif to mediate nucleophilic attack. The findings expand knowledge of C domain functions in non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are key enzymes in pharmaceutical synthesis, with condensation (C) domains catalyzing amide bond formation between aminoacyl substrates. However, recent research has elucidated that the catalytic capabilities of C domains extend beyond the traditional formation of peptide bonds. In this study, we elucidate the cyclization mechanism of the NRPS&#8208;derived natural products hangtaimycin (HTM), characterized by the formation of a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) moiety which involves an intramolecular vinylamide&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attack instead of an N&#8208;terminal amino group. This cyclization is catalyzed by a terminal condensation&#8208;like (CT) domain within the NRPS enzyme HtmB2. We investigated the evolutionary specificity of the HtmB2&#8208;CT within Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417. Employing a multidisciplinary analytical approach, we have delineated the molecular underpinnings of DKP formation within the HTM biosynthesis. This process is facilitated by residue R2776, which modulates the formation of reactive species and stabilizes the amidate through electrostatic interactions. Besides, we found a positive correlation between the alkaline strength of the residue at position 2776 and the activity of HtmB2&#8208;CT. Our study elucidates the formation mechanism of DKPs in NRPS&#8208;derived natural products, thereby bridging a critical gap in the structural and mechanistic understanding of this field.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Behavior by Single&#8208;site Pt on RuO2 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Glycolic Acid from Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Pt&#8208;doped RuO2 was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for synthesis of GA and H2 fuels from PET wastes. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA and H2 yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1 and 2.38&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, using a membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes into valuable glycolic acid (GA) is an ideal solution for resource utilization. However, simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the over&#8208;oxidation and C&#8722;C cleavage during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate. Herein, we develop an atomically isolated Pt on RuO2 (Pt1/RuO2) catalyst composed of high&#8208;density Pt&#8722;Ru interfaces that ensure single&#8208;site adsorption of EG, enrich surface *OH coverage and weaken *CO&#8722;CH2OH intermediate adsorption, thereby synergistically promoting GA generation. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 delivers a remarkable mass activity of 8.09&#8197;A/mgPt, as well as a high GA Faradaic efficiency (95.3&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.9&#8201;%). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1. In&#8208;depth theoretical and in situ spectroscopic investigations reveal the synergy between isolated Pt and oxophilic RuO2 plays a crucial role in high&#8208;efficiency EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. This study offers valuable insights for the rational design of advanced catalysts for GA synthesis from PET wastes via a single&#8208;site doped bimetallic strategy.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Acetaldehyde Production from CO2 and H2O via Synergistic Vacancies and Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of high bonding energy in photocatalytic CO2 conversion and the complexity and false positives in product detection associated with sacrificial agents, sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu are synergistically combined to enhance CO2 activation and lower the activation energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling on Cd0.6Zn0.4S, thereby achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents for CH3CHO production.







Abstract
Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is of great industrial importance and serves as a key intermediate in various organic transformations. Photocatalytic production of acetaldehyde from CO2 represents a sustainable route compared to conventional oxidation processes. However, current photocatalytic systems often face challenges, including limited product selectivity and dependence on sacrificial reagents. Here, we present a Cd0.6Zn0.4S (CZS) photocatalyst co&#8208;modified with sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu (Cu/CZS&#8722;Vs) for the efficient conversion of CO2 to acetaldehyde. Charge density analysis reveals that sulfur vacancies induce charge accumulation around the adjacent metal atoms, creating active sites that strongly anchor CO2 and H+, thereby promoting CO2 conversion while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The atomically dispersed Cu sites facilitate the conversion of key intermediates (i.e., *CHO and *CO) to the crucial C2 intermediate *OCCHO, which can subsequently be converted to acetaldehyde. As a result, this catalyst achieves an acetaldehyde yield of 121.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of ca. 80&#8201;% via photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents, along with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.53&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, underscoring its potential for practical CO2 conversion applications. These results are expected to pave the way for future developments in green chemical processes.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Reactivity in Dense Methane&#8208;Nitrogen Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

CH4 and N2 are abundant molecules in our solar system and are the primary constituents of Titan's atmosphere. Under extreme pressures and temperatures within a diamond anvil cell, CH4 and N2 are demonstrated to react to form a range of compounds, dependent on the conditions and initial concentrations. This provides valuable insight into the complexity of the C&#8722;N&#8722;H ternary system under planetary conditions.







Abstract
Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are among the most abundant elements in the solar system, and our understanding of their interactions is fundamental to prebiotic chemistry. CH4 and N2 are the simplest archetypical molecules formed by these elements and are both markedly stable under extremes of pressure. Through a series of diamond anvil cell experiments supported by density functional theory calculations, we observe diverse compound formation and reactivity in the CH4&#8208;N2 binary system at high pressure. Above 7&#8197;GPa two concentration&#8208;dependent molecular compounds emerge, (CH4)5N2 and (CH4)7(N2)8, held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Strikingly, further compression at room temperature irreversibly breaks the N2 triple bond, inducing the dissociation of CH4 above 140&#8197;GPa, with the near&#8208;quenched samples revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of strong covalently bonded C&#8722;N&#8722;H networks. High temperatures vastly reduce the required pressure to promote the reactivity between CH4 and N2, with NH3 forming together with longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons at 14&#8197;GPa and 670&#8197;K, further decomposing into powdered diamond when temperatures exceed 1200&#8197;K. These results exemplify how pressure&#8208;driven chemistry can cause unexpected complexity in the most simple molecular precursors.

         <title>Multisite Cross&#8208;Linked Ligand Suppressing Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dot&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

A multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid molecules have been proposed to simultaneously passivate non&#8208;radiative defects and stabilize the surface of perovskite QDs, enabling efficient and stable green perovskite QLEDs with a peak EQE of over 25&#8201;% and an operating lifetime of more than 1300&#8197;h, among the highest for perovskite QLEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs), as promisingly solution&#8208;processed emitters, have produced impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the operational stability of perovskite QD&#8208;based LEDs (QLEDs) is still limited by severe ion migration. Here, we propose a multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) molecules to simultaneously reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration in QLEDs. Meanwhile, the introduction of cross&#8208;linked LA ligands can reduce the roughness and contact potential difference variation of QD films, which facilitates the injection and recombination of carriers in devices. As a result, the colour&#8208;saturated green CsPbBr3&#8208;based QLED deliver a maximum EQE of 25.6&#8201;% together with an operational lifetime of 1340&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the most efficient and stable perovskite LEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs. The improvement in device stability is attributed to the reduced ion migration, which is confirmed by analyzing the current behavior of QLEDs and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. This study provides a facile strategy for mitigating halide ion migration in perovskite fields toward more efficient and stable perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>A Multifunctional Molecular Modulated Strategy Featuring Novel Li+ Transport Centers and Li2O&#8208;Rich SEI Layer for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin is introduced to simultaneously boost the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Advanced characterization techniques have revealed that coumarin preserves the mechanical properties of the PEO framework, provides new Li+ hopping centers and constructs a Li2O&#8208;rich SEI layer with excellent Li+ transport dynamics, which are crucial for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
The poor ionic conductivity and interfacial instability severely limit the application of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. In this work, we introduce a multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin, which simultaneously boosts the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;coumarin (PLC) membrane. Unlike conventional additives that diminish PEO's crystallinity, coumarin, with its higher Li+ adsorption energy and stronger dipole moments, acts as a novel &#8216;carrier&#8217; for Li+ without compromising the mechanical properties of the PEO matrix. Its synergistic effect with PEO creates a more efficient Li+ transport pathway to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Simultaneously, coumarin as a sacrificial agent by utilizing its carbonyl group, preferentially reacts with lithium metal to prevent the decomposition of PEO and lithium salts. Furthermore, coumarin acts as an in situ Li2O&#8208;inducer, facilitating the formation of a dense Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with faster ion diffusion kinetics at the interface. The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000&#8197;h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO4 battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention ratio of 93&#8201;% after 550&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Electron Cloud and Space Structure Symmetry Induced Microscopic Split&#8208;phase Interface for High&#8208;rate and Long&#8208;term Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to constrain H2O activity and accelerate Zn2+ migration, which remarkably solves the interfacial side reactions and uneven Zn deposition caused by unstable EDL, especially under fast mass&#8208;charge transfer at high&#8208;rate conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes and Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with excellent endurance.







Abstract
Weak dipole interactions between highly symmetric H2O molecules and SO42&#8722; species are the root cause of unstable electric double layer (EDL), which triggers the hydrogen evolution reaction and Zn dendrite formation, significantly impeding the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we designed a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface (MSPI) by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to suppress interfacial side reactions and achieve uniform Zn deposition. The structurally asymmetric methylurea (MU) molecules possess both hydrophobic methyl and hydrophilic amino groups, which disrupt the continuity of H&#8208;bonding network and the aggregation state of H2O molecules, resulting in peculiar nanoscale core&#8211;shell&#8208;like clusters. Such a unique structure further evolves into MSPI at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, ensuring a continuously stable EDL. The DRT analysis and MD simulation confirmed that MSPI structure is composed of the outer H2O layer and the inner MU layer, which greatly suppress the activity of H2O molecules and accelerate Zn2+ migration. Consequently, the formulated electrolyte exhibited remarkable cycle reversibility over 1500&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, achieving a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity of 30&#8197;Ah&#8901;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, its feasibility was demonstrated by coupling with the I2@AC cathode, achieving an impressive 28,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Coordination Topology Design in Anion&#8208;Rich Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolyte, the equal molar dual&#8208;anion strategy expands the solvation energy level distribution and boosts the Li&#8208;ion transport. Moreover, a universal principle is found based on the coordination topology of the dual&#8208;anion combination: only the combination containing anion with the multi&#8208;coordination site can raise the Li&#8208;ion transport in such systems, supporting the design of high&#8208;rate lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;rich solvated structures are promising for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their good interfacial compatibility. Nevertheless, limited Li&#8208;ion transport of these electrolytes has hindered their high&#8208;rate application. Here we demonstrate that Li&#8208;ion transport in anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolytes could be facilitated by designing the coordination topology of anions in the solvation structure. Results show that, for a binary&#8208;anion electrolyte, equal&#8208;molar anions show the most expanded energy level distribution of solvation structures, thus reducing the Li&#8208;ion transport energy barrier, and resulting in a Li&#8208;ion conductivity even higher than that of the commercial carbonate electrolyte at a temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. More importantly, we identify a universal principle governing the Li&#8208;ion transport enhancement driven by anion configurations: only the combination of anions with multi&#8208;coordination sites shows facilitation in Li&#8208;ion transport, while the combination of centrosymmetric anions with the mono&#8208;coordination site harms it. The diversified anion&#8208;rich solvated structures also form stable interphases on the electrodes, enabling long&#8208;term cycling of 4.5&#8197;V LMBs at a high current density of 3.78&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Overall, our findings shine new light on developing practical electrolytes for energy&#8208;dense LMBs.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Induced Electrochemical Ion&#8208;Solvent Cointercalation in Pillared Titanate Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer&#8208;expansion of hydrogen tetratitanate is realized with organic pillars. Optimized atomistic configurations of the pillared materials are proposed by characterization with experiment and simulation. The nanoconfinement modification of HTO induces ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions with improved kinetics and increased storage capacity.







Abstract
Electrochemical ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions are an avenue to reach improved kinetics compared to the corresponding intercalation of desolvated ions. Here, we demonstrate the impact of different structural pillar molecules on the electrochemical Li+ intercalation mechanism in expanded hydrogen titanate (HTO) electrode materials. We show that interlayer&#8208;expansion of HTO with organic pillars can enable cointercalation reactions. Their electrochemical reversibility is drastically improved when non&#8208;cross&#8208;linking pillars are employed that expand and separate the host material's individual layers, underlining the impact of the electrochemo&#8208;mechanics of the nanoconfined interlayer space. This pillared HTO structure results in an increased Li+ storage capacity and reversibility compared to pristine HTO. We derive structural models of the pillared HTO host materials based on combined experiments and theoretical calculations, and employ electrochemical operando experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the nanoconfinement&#8208;induced cointercalation mechanism in pillared HTO electrode materials. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoconfined pillar molecules to modify host materials and enable highly reversible cointercalation reactions with improved capacity and kinetics.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Polar&#8208;Functionalized Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silane protection strategy is developed to enable early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed efficient terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene and polar monomers. A series of polar functionalized polyolefin elastomers with high molecular weight and high 1&#8208;octene incorporation are successfully synthesized. This strategy shows comprehensive better performances than previously wide practiced aluminum protection strategy, leading to products with excellent mechanical and elastic properties, along with great practical applications.







Abstract
Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) are widely used for many applications including plastic toughening and encapsulating photovoltaic modules. The introduction of polar groups into POEs improves their compatibility and adhesion with polar components, but it is challenging to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polar&#8208;functionalized POEs (P&#8208;POEs) via copolymerization. Here, we report a silane protection strategy to enable the production of P&#8208;POEs (including an ethylene&#8208;based P&#8208;EPOE and a propylene&#8208;based P&#8208;PPOE) with widely tunable 1&#8208;octene incorporation ratios (7.4&#8211;19.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), appropriate polar monomer incorporation ratios (0.7&#8211;2.7 mol&#8201;%), melting points (63.8&#8211;99.8&#8201;&#176;C), and high molecular weights (up to 43.8&#215;104&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This approach involved the early transition metal&#8208;catalyzed terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene, and protected polar monomers. This silane protection strategy is superior to the previously widely practiced aluminum&#8208;based protection strategies in terms of polymerization activity, polymer molecular weight, comonomer incorporation, and product processibility. Most importantly, the P&#8208;POE products exhibited excellent mechanical properties and elasticity and served as high&#8208;performance compatibilizers and adhesives to enhance the functional applications of POEs.

This approach involved the early transition metal-catalyzed terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1-octene, and protected polar monomers. This silane protection strategy is superior to the previously widely practiced aluminum-based protection strategies in terms of polymerization activity, polymer molecular weight, comonomer incorporation, and product processibility. Most importantly, the P-POE products exhibited excellent mechanical properties and elasticity and served as high-performance compatibilizers and adhesives to enhance the functional applications of POEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activating La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni Bridge in Ordered Macroporous Interface for Electrochemical Urea Wastewater Purification</title>

         <dc:description>
The La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge was constructed and activated in the three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous La2O3&#8208;NiO, which acted as a kind of superior anode catalyst in urea electrooxidation and purification. 3DOM morphology increased the contact surface of the material with the solution and accelerates mass transfer. The electron transfer from La to Ni was proved to accelerat the formation of active phase, C=O adsorption and N&#8722;H bond cleavage during the catalysis. It provides insights from the microscale to the macroscale level demonstrating how morphology engineering and La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge boost urea oxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater purification significantly aids in environmental protection, but it remains a considerable challenge in designing high performance anode urea oxidation electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a La&#8208;induced three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) NiO heterostructure to improve Ni sites electron density for urea electrooxidation by activating the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge. This material demonstrated exceptional performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, characterized by a low cell voltage (1.49&#8197;V @ 80&#8201;&#176;C) and 280&#8197;h stability test at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density (25&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed promising efficiency in urea wastewater purification. Permeation experiments revealed the crucial role of 3DOM morphological in facilitating mass transfer processes. A high valence nickel mechanism (HNM) on the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge during catalysis was proposed, based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Experimentally, in situ Raman and UV&#8208;vis spectra demonstrated that Ni active species Ni&#948;+ (&#948;&#8805;3) promote urea oxidation kinetics, while in situ ATR&#8208;IR proved strong adsorption of C=O with Ni sites and the enhancement of urea N&#8722;H bonds cleavage, supporting the HNM. This work enables us to underscore the critical importance of La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge with 3DOM architectures and promising contributions to urea wastewater purification.

         <title>An Adhesive Adaptation Layer Mitigates the Interfacial Instabilities of Rigid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical solid polymer electrolytes (H&#8208;SPEs) featuring an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) effectively mitigate interfacial instabilities in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries by reinforcing electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact and promoting uniform lithium deposition. This novel architecture demonstrates excellent cycling stability, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity retention over 960&#8197;cycles with high&#8208;loading NMC622 cathode.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely recognized as promising candidates for enabling solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with improved safety, high energy density, and extended cycling life. The traditional perspective posits that increasing the mechanical modulus of SPEs enhances their capacity to regulate Li0 deposition and suppress dendrite penetration. However, this study reveals a distinct failure mechanism: a rigid SPE with a high storage modulus suffers from delamination&#8208;induced cell failure due to its inability to accommodate the volumetric changes of the Li0 anode. To address these limitations, we developed a hierarchical SPE incorporating an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) positioned between the Li0 anode and the rigid SPE. The AAL combines strong adhesive strength, effectively mitigating delamination, with flowability, allowing it to eliminate interfacial voids and defects. Structural characterization via Cryo&#8208;TEM and SEM demonstrates that this hierarchical design facilitates uniform, dense, and whisker&#8208;free Li0 deposition, in sharp contrast to the uneven and porous morphology observed with the rigid SPE alone. Furthermore, the enhanced interfacial stability promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;enriched SEI layer, contributing to long&#8208;term cycling stability. As a result, the H&#8208;SPE exhibits superior electrochemical performance, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity over 960 cycles when paired with high&#8208;loading (1.6&#8197;mAh/cm2) NMC622 cathode.

         <title>Enabling Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation Prior to Water Reduction in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Mild Protic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and introduces mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) for aqueous zinc batteries according to thermodynamics. MMI is reduced prior to water, forming an organic&#8208;dominated SEI that effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition. Hence, zinc anodes exhibited exceptional reversibility and cycle stability in electrolyte with 20&#8197;mM MMI.







Abstract
Challenges like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite formation on zinc anodes hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), primarily due to the lack of an exceptional passivating solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). To effectively prevent water decomposition, it is essential to in situ construct SEI prior to water reduction. This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and predicts reduction potentials of mild protic compounds using thermodynamics. Based on this insight, mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) is introduced and found to be reduced prior to water at higher electrode potentials, as MMI exhibits slightly higher proton activity than water due to its thiol group. The reduction of MMI produces isothiocyanate species via a proposed electrocatalytic ring cleavage mechanism, which deposit on zinc anodes to form an SEI predominantly composed of organic compounds supplemented with Zn(OH)2. Benefiting from the unique advantage of preferential reduction before water, the MMI&#8208;derived SEI exhibits a superior passivating effect, as evidenced by a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in corrosion current of zinc anodes from 1170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 13.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The SEI effectively suppresses HER, and ensures dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, leading to high reversible zinc anodes with exceptional electrochemical performances.

         <title>Preparation of Peapod&#8208;Like Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Periodic Sequence via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Morphology Differentiation and Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel strategy for constructing peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence through fusion of vesicles and porous spheres. The generation and assembly of vesicles and porous spheres are achieved via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in one&#8208;pot. The aggregation unit numbers of peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers are affected by the length of solvophobic block and collision probability of vesicles and porous spheres.







Abstract
Inorganic nanoparticles have so far dominated the field of nanoparticle assembly, and assembly of pure organic nanoparticles (such as block copolymer nanoparticles) has rarely been examined in colloidal systems. Expanding the scope of nanoparticles is of great significance for the study of nanoparticle assembly. Herein, a paradigm for the copolymerization of organic nanoparticles into peapod&#8208;like linear nanostructures with periodic sequence is introduced. Vesicles and porous spheres are generated in situ during polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and can be viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;). The subsequent copolymerization of these nanomers is completed in one&#8208;pot, which greatly simplifies the preparation of nanomers and peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers. It is demonstrated that appropriate &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are crucial to the formation of nanomers and their copolymerization progress. Notably, the research subjects in nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence have expanded to organic nanoparticles, which is beneficial to further expand the horizons of nanoparticle assembly. Moreover, the multiple separated compartments in the peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers will open new directions toward development of artificial organelle and on&#8208;demand catalysis in different compartments within the same nano&#8208;object.

It is demonstrated that appropriate &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are crucial to the formation of nanomers and their copolymerization progress. Notably, the research subjects in nano-copolymers with periodic sequence have expanded to organic nanoparticles, which is beneficial to further expand the horizons of nanoparticle assembly. Moreover, the multiple separated compartments in the peapod-like nano-copolymers will open new directions toward development of artificial organelle and on-demand catalysis in different compartments within the same nano-object.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemocatalytic Cell Tagging Platform for Recording Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions via Engineered Palladium&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

This study proposes an innovative chemocatalytic proximity labeling platform&#8208;Artificial Metalloenzyme Tagging Technology (ArM&#8208;Tag). The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a protein scaffold to catalyze a bioorthogonal O&#8208;deallylation reaction directly on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range.







Abstract
Proximity labeling platforms (PLPs) have become a powerful tool for studying spatial cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs) in living organisms. However, their effectiveness often relies on membranal catalytic modules of bait cells, such as natural enzymes or small&#8208;molecule photocatalysts, which are typically constrained by complex genetic modifications or the limited applicability of visible light. Here, we present a novel chemocatalytic approach, ArM&#8208;Tag, which utilizes an engineered artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) for cell surface&#8208;localized tagging. The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a streptavidin (SAV) scaffold to catalyze the O&#8208;deallylation reaction on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range. By integrating Biotin&#8208;SAV technology with directed evolution, we engineered a series of biotinylated Pd complexes and optimized the ArM for efficient catalysis. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying the ArM&#8208;Tag system to selectively record antigen&#8208;specific CCIs, specifically showing how CAR&#8722;T cells interact with tumor cells through the mesothelin/anti&#8208;mesothelin axis. This versatile, non&#8208;genetic system provides a powerful tool for probing CCIs and offers exciting prospects for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in targeted cancer treatments and immune cell&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann Water Catalyzed Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the catalytic role of water molecule and the inherent thermal radiation in gaseous homogeneous high&#8208;temperatue propane dehydrogenation, in which the water molecule could generate hydroxyl radicals with the help of thermal radiation and thus facilitate the reaction. Consequently, the proposed system could achieve a 37.93&#8201;% olefin yield and a 51.14&#8201;% single&#8208;pass propane conversion, and an excellent stability for over 2,000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The traditional wisdom of utilizing water in practical olefin synthesis has been viewed as a means to reduce alkane partial pressure and assist in coke removal. However, under such harsh reaction conditions, the potential catalytic role of the water molecule remains unclear. This study explores the intriguing concept that the water molecule, through the selective excitation of molecular vibrations and collisions induced by thermal energy and thermal radiation, could act as a catalyst in homogeneous gaseous propane dehydrogenation. This occurs via the generation of the OH&#8901; radicals, resulting in an olefin yield of 37.93&#8201;%, a single pass propane conversion of 51.14&#8201;%, and an excellent stability of more than 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven CuAAC Reaction Catalyzed by Photosensitive Biohybrids Energized by Lactate for Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system has been presented for boosting cancer immunotherapy. Powered by lactate, the biohybrid can trigger the CuAAC reaction to generate active drugs in situ through bacterial respiration. Of note, under illumination, the CuAAC reaction can be further accelerated.







Abstract
As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper (I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strongly depends on the reducing agents and the rate of the CuAAC reaction is far from sufficient to produce drug agents under physiological conditions. It is necessary and highly demanding to develop an efficient CuAAC reaction without using chemical reducing agents. Herein, inspired by the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria within the realm of synthetic biology, a photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system for boosting cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The bacteria specifically anaerobically catabolize lactate at the tumor site, accompanied by transferring electrons to the bioorthogonal catalyst, thereby triggering the CuAAC reaction to produce active drugs in situ. Strikingly, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by attached AuNPs can be transported into bacterial cytoplasm to accelerate the CuAAC reaction by promoting cellular metabolism. The biohybrid enables synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and alleviation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Ingeniously, ICD and lactate consumption both boost the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. Overall, the system provides a bridge between the tumor metabolism and CuAAC reaction through bacterial respiration, offering fascinating opportunities for controlled synthesis of active molecules by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Achieving Free&#8208;Electron Transfer Reversal and dz2&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Modulation on Core&#8208;shell NiS@Au Cocatalysts for Highly Selective H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiS&#8208;induced free&#8208;electron reversal migration discharges dz2&#8208;orbital electrons of Au cocatalysts to reduce the antibonding occupancy of Au&#948;+&#8208;Oad bonds, thus improving O2 adsorption and stabilizing *OOH intermediates on NiS@Au cocatalysts to achieve highly selective H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
Spontaneous free&#8208;electron migration usually occurs on the interface between host photocatalysts and cocatalysts, but the influences of the charge transfer direction on the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) of cocatalysts have not been taken seriously. Herein, an innovative electron&#8208;transfer reversal is proposed to direct the free&#8208;electron transfer in a way that enables highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR on Au cocatalysts. To this end, metallic Au nanoparticles are originally loaded on NiS particles to fabricate novel core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 surface by a directional photodeposition procedure. XAS spectra and DFT calculations disclose that the intergrated NiS induces a reversed free&#8208;electron transfer from Au nanoparticles to NiS core, thus essentially modulating dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy of Au atoms to enhance O2 adsorption and stabilize key *OOH intermediates, endowing core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts with a highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR process for efficient H2O2 evolution. Consequently, the optimized g&#8208;C3N4/NiS@Au photocatalyst achieves a remarkably promoted H2O2&#8208;production rate of 264.82&#8197;&#956;mol/h/50&#8197;mg in the air environment, possessing a high apparent quantum efficiency of 8.07&#8201;% under visible light. This work provides novel insights on purposefully steering free&#8208;electron transfer direction to engineer dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy, offering a feasible approach for designing highly active photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Evolution&#8208;Guided Discovery of Antimycobacterial Triculamin&#8208;Like Lasso Peptides</title>

The hypothesized convergent biosynthesis of triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from different biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) types represented across multiple bacterial phyla. The elucidation of the triculamin non&#8208;canonical BGC and resistance mechanism by heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus and in&#8197;vitro acetylation with resistance conveying enzyme. Discovery and characterization of two triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from canonical lasso peptide BGCs.







Abstract
Triculamin is a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) lasso peptide with potent antimycobacterial activity, produced by an unusual, non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and N&#8208;acetyltransferase (triT). Through in&#8197;vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin&#8208;like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non&#8208;canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin&#8208;like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin&#8208;like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross&#8208;phylum distribution.

These complexes, along with (CH2CH2O)4XeO3, were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and computational studies that show the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts with the crown ethers and water molecules are &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.







Abstract
Following on our report of the first coordination complex between a noble&#8208;gas compound and a crown ether, (CH2CH2O)5XeO3, the reactions and structures of XeO3 complexes with 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 were investigated. The reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with XeO3 in dilute aqueous HF solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, whereas reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with moist solid XeO3 in acetone solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O complexes are air&#8208;stable and shock&#8208;insensitive, whereas [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF is a treacherous, shock&#8208;sensitive detonator. Low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that XeO3 is coordinated to the crown ether and H2O through short Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts. Mappings of the XeO3 Hirshfeld surfaces onto 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O reveal regions of negative electrostatic potential (EP) on the oxygen atoms of the crown ethers and regions of high positive EP on the Xe(VI) atom of XeO3 that are consistent with &#963;&#8208;hole bonds. The calculated gas&#8208;phase geometries, Wiberg bond valences and indices, and empirical bond valences corroborate the descriptions of the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;

         <title>Highly Strained Electron&#8208;Rich Molecular Bowl and Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowls is essential due to their potential complementary properties to molecules such as corannulene and sumanene. However, their development is challenging because of the inherent high strain. Herein, the small electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1 (C20N2H8) and the wavy dimer 2 have been synthesized, and their optical, electronic, and supramolecular properties are extensively studied.







Abstract
Introducing two pyrrole rings at the armchair edges of perylene creates the small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1, which can be viewed as a nitrogen&#8208;doped end&#8208;cap of C70. Despite numerous attempts since 2008, its synthesis has been hindered by strain and synthetic challenges. In this study, we present the synthesis and property analysis of molecular bowl 1 and its dimer, the wavy&#8208;shaped nanographene 2. Substituents on nitrogen atoms significantly affect the bowl depth, intermolecular interactions, and supramolecular behaviors. Consequently, the butyl&#8208;substituted molecular bowl 1&#8201;a forms unusual polar crystals with all bowls oriented similarly, suggesting potential pyroelectric or ferroelectric applications. Due to the electron&#8208;rich nature, compounds 1 exhibit significantly strong binding affinity towards fullerene, with 1&#8201;a forming a sandwich structure with C70. Furthermore, neutral bowls 1 display counter&#8208;rotating ring currents similar to corannulene, while their dications exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The wavy&#8208;structured nanographene 2 demonstrates two continuously reversible oxidation processes, and its dication 22+ shows remarkably high stability under ambient conditions. In summary, this work constructs a small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl and its nanographene dimer, highlighting their exceptional properties, promising applications, and potential as foundations for future advanced nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Constructing Dense Morphology of Sn with High Reversibility under High Areal&#8208;capacity for Anode&#8208;Free Tin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiourea (TU) was proposed as an effective additive to constructing dense morphology of deposited Sn in acidic methylsulfonate&#8208;based electrolyte. By participating in double electrode layer, TU reduces exchange current density of Sn2+/Sn redox, suppresses rampant two&#8208;dimension, and makes Sn anode exert high coulombic efficiency of 99.85% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free Sn battery was developed.







Abstract
Sn electrode possesses high reversibility, redox kinetics and corrosion resistance, as well as non&#8208;toxic and environmental compatibility, which is competitive candidate for aqueous batteries. However, due to huge size of deposition particles and &#8220;dead Sn&#8221;, it is a great challenge to obtain high areal&#8208;capacity (&gt;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible Sn redox electrochemistry with high areal&#8208;capacity enabled by thiourea additive. Systematical investigations reveal the participation of thiourea molecules in the electrical double layer, reducing exchange current density and suppressing rampant two&#8208;dimensional diffusion. As a result, flat and dense scale&#8208;like deposition Sn morphology is obtained, which enables high cycle stability with high areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for symmetrical cell with lean electrolyte (25&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and delivering a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;% with practical high 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 area&#8208;capacity for asymmetrical cell. More importantly, anode&#8208;free Organic||Sn battery is developed, and 62&#8201;% capacity retention can be obtained after 570 cycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Triple&#8208;Atom Sites Combined with Oxygen Vacancy for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Propionic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a defect engineering strategy to create asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs), which achieves high propionic acid synthesis rates and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the key roles of OVs and triple&#8208;atom sites. Such OVs&#8208;engineered asymmetric catalytic sites efficiently promote the multistep C&#8722;C coupling process.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon products is an emerging approach for achieving carbon neutrality; however, the design of active sites that effectively promote multistep C&#8722;C coupling remains a challenge. Here, we propose a straightforward defect engineering approach to construct asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (named CWO&#8208;OVs). The optimized CWO&#8208;OVs achieve a photochemical synthesis rate of propionic acid (C3H6O2, PA) of 86.46&#177;2.92&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with an electron&#8208;based selectivity of 89.27&#8201;%, which exhibits a remarkable advantage in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations corroborate the prominent role of OVs in inducing the triple&#8208;atom sites: (1) the asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+ triggers the first step of C1&#8208;C1 coupling to form *CH2CH3; (2) Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+ facilitates subsequent C2&#8208;C1 bonding, ultimately leading to PA production. This charge&#8208;asymmetric cascade reaction system offers new insights into the design of efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon products.

         <title>Anion Adsorption at the Inner&#8208;Helmholtz Plane Directs Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of anion adsorption at the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane in directing CEI formation was investigated using multiple in situ/operando techniques. QCM&#8722;D directly observes its influence on interfacial structure, while in situ spectroscopy and EQCM&#8722;D confirm its impact on CEI chemistry. The anion&#8208;driven interphase leads to a more inorganic&#8208;rich CEI, suppressing electrolyte decomposition and enhancing LiCoO2 cycling stability at high voltages.







Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (CEI) on cathode surface constitutes the foundation of realizing high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet its formation, a highly heterogeneous process involving irreversible reactions between electrolyte components and cathode materials, remains poorly understood. Herein, combining multiple in situ/operando interfacial characterization techniques, we establish the correlation between interfacial structure and interphasial chemistry, and reveal the key role played by adsorptive behavior of various electrolyte components in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane during CEI formation. Quartz crystal microbalance equipped with dissipation modification detects that difluorooxalatoborate (DFOB&#8722;) anion preferentially adsorbed on LiCoO2 tends to expel carbonate solvents from the adsorption layer, thus suppressing their electrochemical decomposition at high voltages and leading to a more compact CEI derived from anions with limited contribution from organic ingredients. Consequently, the CoO2 lattice structure protected by the dense CEI remains intact despite near&#8208;complete delithiation, thereby ensuring excellent cycling stability for 4.7&#8197;V operation of LiCoO2 cathode. The atomistic&#8208;level insight into the key factors that govern CEI formation provides directive knowledge that accelerates electrolyte design for high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Nanourchin&#8208;like Uricase&#8208;Poly(L&#8208;proline) Conjugate with Retained Enzymatic Activity, Mitigated Immunogenicity, and Sustained Efficacy Upon Repeated Administrations</title>

Poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugated uricase was facilely produced via a grafting&#8208;from approach, which showed mitigated immunogenicity and preserved activity in vivo after repeated injections.







Abstract
The poor half&#8208;life and strong immunogenicity of proteins such as uricase (UOx), a therapeutic enzyme for chronic refractory gout and hyperuricemia, are pressing clinical challenges. Although conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGylation) of UOx can improve the pharmacokinetics, preexisting or induced anti&#8208;PEG antibodies, which lead to accelerate blood clearance (ABC) and reduced response rate, have been a major clinical hurdle. Herein, we report the facile &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; preparation of a nanourchin&#8208;like uricase&#8208;poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugate, namely UOx&#8208;PLP, with high grafting&#8208;density, enhanced thermal, lyophilization, freeze&#8208;thaw, and proteolytic stability. Through a transient preblocking strategy in the synthesis, the UOx&#8208;PLP overcomes activity loss and retains ~82&#8201;% enzyme activity. In Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats, UOx&#8208;PLP stimulates minimum complement activation and anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Unlike PEG&#8208;UOx gave a significantly reduced half&#8208;life after repetitive administrations, UOx&#8208;PLP shows no sign of ABC effect. Moreover, the half&#8208;life of UOx&#8208;PLP remain almost unchanged when cross&#8208;administrated to rats previously received PEG&#8208;UOx and with high titers of anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Finally, UOx&#8208;PLP shows minimum loss of efficacy after five straight administrations in a UOx knock&#8208;out hyperuricemia mice model, whereas PEG&#8208;UOx experiences sharp loss of efficacy upon the same treatment. Overall, the simple preparation and outstanding nonclinical results highlight the enormous potential of UOx&#8208;PLP for future clinical translation.

Through a transient preblocking strategy in the synthesis, the UOx-PLP overcomes activity loss and retains ~82&#8201;% enzyme activity. In Sprague-Dawley rats, UOx-PLP stimulates minimum complement activation and anti-UOx antibodies. Unlike PEG-UOx gave a significantly reduced half-life after repetitive administrations, UOx-PLP shows no sign of ABC effect. Moreover, the half-life of UOx-PLP remain almost unchanged when cross-administrated to rats previously received PEG-UOx and with high titers of anti-UOx antibodies. Finally, UOx-PLP shows minimum loss of efficacy after five straight administrations in a UOx knock-out hyperuricemia mice model, whereas PEG-UOx experiences sharp loss of efficacy upon the same treatment. Overall, the simple preparation and outstanding nonclinical results highlight the enormous potential of UOx-PLP for future clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanofabrication via SEM Electron&#8208;Beam Stimulated Suzuki&#8211;Miyura Type Reaction: Fingerprints of Carbazole Derivative Revealed by Synchrotron&#8208;IR Nanospectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>

This study investigates the conditions under which 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole can be formed in solid state by using a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction triggered by electron beam irradiation. Synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and mass spectrometry revealed signatures of the target product, suggesting a potential palladium&#8208;free reaction pathway and offering a direct route to the fabrication of nanodevices.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based compounds have demonstrated interesting physical and chemical properties for OLED devices. 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole has a direct application in the composition of structures with potential to suppress the loss of efficiency under high luminance conditions along with its use in the emitting layer. In this study, we reveal and explore the conditions in which a triggered electron beams (e&#8208;beams) solid state Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction between 3,6&#8208;diiodocarbazole and phenylboronic acid could be carried out. Applying typical SEM acceleration voltage (30&#8197;keV), sufficient energy transfer enabled the activation of the reaction. Synchrotron Infrared Nano Spectroscopy (SINS) was used to acquire nanoscale molecular vibrational spectra and compare with conventional FTIR absorption spectra for chemical characterization. Evidences obtained by mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole under higher e&#8208;beam dose (30&#8197;keV, 10&#8197;minutes), when compared to 5 and 10&#8197;keV. In addition, the phenylboronic acid seems to have a role in the reaction outcome. Both samples irradiated in the presence and in the absence of palladium exhibited the fingerprints of the expected product 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole shedding light on possible alternative mechanisms and the straightforward construction of nanodevices.

         <title>Crystallization Modulation and Comprehensive Defect Passivation by Carbonyl Functionalized Spacer Cation Towards High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation strategy was proposed of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. By this synergetic strategy, improved crystallization, reduced defect density, released residual stress and minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses were accomplished simultaneously. The inverted devices delivered a champion PCE of 25.77&#8201;%.







Abstract
The inverted cesium/formamidinium (CsFA)&#8208;based methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells possess great potential in simultaneously realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent stability. However, the uncontrollable crystallization process and poor film quality hinder further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Herein, we propose a synergistic modulation strategy of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. L&#8208;Alanine benzyl ester hydrochloride (L&#8208;ABEHCl) containing carbonyl functionalized ammonium cation is incorporated into perovskite precursor solution, increasing the nucleation rate and reducing the crystal growth rate because of its strong interaction with precursor components, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. No 2D perovskite is formed for L&#8208;ABEHCl as additive whereas 2D perovskite is formed upon L&#8208;ABEHCl post&#8208;treatment. It is revealed that FA+ and Cs+ in precursor solution suppress the formation of 2D perovskite. As a result, the L&#8208;ABEHCl passivates the defects at GBs in the form of organic salts and passivates interface defects in the form of 2D perovskite. Due to minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses, the inverted devices using synergistic modulation strategy achieve a maximum PCE of 25.77&#8201;% (certified stabilized PCE of 25.59&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation method. The unencapsulated target device maintains 90.85&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 2300&#8197;h of continuous maximum power point tracking, among the most excellent stabilities accomplished by inverted devices.

         <title>Exploiting Bis&#8208;Sulfonimide Featuring Multiple d&#8211;p&#960; Bonds to Construct Interlayers for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), distinguished by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently introduced as an adaptable electron&#8208;withdrawing motif to construct interlayer materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). The unique conformational and electronic structure of BSI imparts excellent thickness tolerance and universal applicability to the interlayer materials, leading to 19.80&#8201;% efficiency OSCs with good operational stability.







Abstract
Herein, bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), characterized by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently utilized as a general and extendable building block to develop a series of multifunctional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). An illustrative CIM, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI, demonstrates favorable alcohol processability, superior work function tunability, appropriate energy levels, strong self&#8208;doping effect, and decent crystallinity. These attributes contribute to its high conductivity exceeding 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm, as well as precise optimization of the interfacial connection between the active layer and metal cathode. Therefore, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI&#8208;based OSCs delivers an outstanding efficiency of 18.08&#8201;% using PM6:Y6 active layer while retaining 84&#8201;% of its initial performance after tracking at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1100&#8197;hours. Additionally, the devices maintain over 94&#8201;% of the optimal performance across a film thickness range of BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI from 5 to 90&#8197;nm. Moreover, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI exhibits high compatibility with various active layers, enabling a record efficiency of 19.80&#8201;% with the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO active layer. This work not only introduces a new library of water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type semiconductors containing BSI, while also pioneers the creation of thickness&#8208;insensitive CIMs for stable and efficient OSCs by integrating electron&#8208;withdrawing components with d&#8208;p&#960; bonds.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Lamellar Conductive Heterochannels with Optical&#8208;Electrical Coupling Sensitivity for Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing PyGO conductive heterochannel with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity were fabricated through super&#8208;assembly strategy for smart ion transport. Benefiting from the coupling conductivity and photosensitivity of the PPy conductive network, the output power density of salinity gradient energy device with this lamellar photoelectric membrane could achieve 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under illumination.







Abstract
Artificial nanofluidic devices inspired bylight&#8208;driven ion transport in biological systems, leveraging the photoelectric effect, have attracted extensive attention for their potential in signal transduction and smart ion transport applications. However, effective separation of photogenerated carriers in traditional p&#8208;n junction interface can be hindered by energy band structure of different semiconductor materials. Here, we present a novel approach using conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to modify graphene oxide (GO), creating polypyrrole&#8208;graphene oxide (PyGO) functional lamellar conductive nanochannels with tailored channel&#8208;sized gradients and inherent optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity via a facile super&#8208;assembly strategy. This design facilitates the PyGO own conductive lamellar channels and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly enhanced selective ion transport behavior. Coupling the conductivity and photosensitivity of PPy contributes to a peak power density of 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under a salinity differential of 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl, which is 35.6&#8201;% higher than that under dark conditions. Additionally, combing the salinity gradients with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity of the nanofludic devices, we demonstrate the application of PyGO in a real&#8208;time detection device for monitoring ion concentrations in nutrient solutions, paving the way for smart irrigation systems in agriculture.

     alt="Super-Assembled Lamellar Conductive Heterochannels with Optical-Electrical Coupling Sensitivity for Smart Ion Transport"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free-standing PyGO conductive heterochannel with optical-electrical coupling sensitivity were fabricated through super-assembly strategy for smart ion transport. Benefiting from the coupling conductivity and photosensitivity of the PPy conductive network, the output power density of salinity gradient energy device with this lamellar photoelectric membrane could achieve 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under illumination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial nanofluidic devices inspired bylight-driven ion transport in biological systems, leveraging the photoelectric effect, have attracted extensive attention for their potential in signal transduction and smart ion transport applications. However, effective separation of photogenerated carriers in traditional p-n junction interface can be hindered by energy band structure of different semiconductor materials. Here, we present a novel approach using conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to modify graphene oxide (GO), creating polypyrrole-graphene oxide (PyGO) functional lamellar conductive nanochannels with tailored channel-sized gradients and inherent optical-electrical coupling sensitivity via a facile super-assembly strategy. This design facilitates the PyGO own conductive lamellar channels and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly enhanced selective ion transport behavior. Coupling the conductivity and photosensitivity of PPy contributes to a peak power density of 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under a salinity differential of 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl, which is 35.6&#8201;% higher than that under dark conditions. Additionally, combing the salinity gradients with optical-electrical coupling sensitivity of the nanofludic devices, we demonstrate the application of PyGO in a real-time detection device for monitoring ion concentrations in nutrient solutions, paving the way for smart irrigation systems in agriculture. This work presents a novel and effective strategy for light-driven ion transport with potential applications in energy conversion and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes by Interfacial Engineering of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) disrupt the hydrogen bond network through the surface amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands, activate the interfacial water, and enrich the alkyne molecules. In addition, their unique enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets adsorb alkyne molecules through the &#963;&#8208;bonding mode, allowing the timely desorption of alkene, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Owing to its green energy and hydrogen sources, electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes is an attractive alternative for industrial alkene production. However, its broad application is hindered by low selectivity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to side reactions like over&#8208;hydrogenation to alkanes. Here, we demonstrate that atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) can electrocatalyze alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with 98&#8201;% conversion, 99&#8201;% selectivity, and 85&#8201;% FE, in a broad substrate pool. This is achieved by engineering the local environment at the catalytically active sites. We leverage amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands to pre&#8208;concentrate water molecules and alkynes near the ligand&#8208;layer/Ag25 interface. Long&#8208;chain ligands can disrupt the hydrogen&#8208;bond network at the interface, the high negative charge of Ag25 can attract weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water through counterions and promote the generation of active hydrogen (H*), while the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets on the surface of Ag25 NCs facilitate adsorption of terminal alkynes via &#963;&#8208;bonding to the surface Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the preference of the &#963;&#8208;bonding model of alkyne and further revealed the facile release of product alkene. This work not only exemplifies an atomically precise interface engineering strategy to control the local environment of active sites for optimized activity and selectivity.

         <title>Twist and Shine: Ultra&#8208;Narrow Red Emission from Nitrogen and Oxygen Co&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen are synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy. These molecules feature a bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene core, with benzopyran rings fused at the periphery to enhance the rigidity of &#960;&#8208;framework. This unique design enables ultra&#8208;narrow red emission, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Nanographenes, known for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have garnered significant interest for their tunable electronic structures, particularly through heteroatom doping. Herein, we report the synthesis of two twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes (h&#8208;NGs) co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen via a three&#8208;step strategy, where the tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization and ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution serve as a key step. Both h&#8208;NGs incorporate a unique bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene (BFDAC) core, with one further extending the &#960;&#8208;system via peri&#8208;fusion of four benzopyran units. Single&#8208;crystal analyses reveal that BFDAC core of both h&#8208;NGs adopts a highly twisted geometry, whereas the benzopyran&#8208;fused one has enhanced rigidity. Theoretical studies confirm a global aromaticity with 30 &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized along BFDAC periphery. Notably, co&#8208;doping enables precise electronic tuning, with pyridinic nitrogen lowering the LUMO level and benzopyran oxygen raising the HOMO level. Both h&#8208;NGs display the red photoluminescence (PL), and the benzopyran&#8208;fused derivative exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm, among the narrowest reported for organic red&#8208;emitting materials. Both h&#8208;NGs exhibit acid&#8208;responsive optical behavior including near&#8208;infrared absorption shift and PL quenching, providing additional functional versatility.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Uric Acid Oxidation via Interdistance&#8208;Dependent Switching Pathways in Correlated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Boosting Sensing Signals</title>

         <dc:description>
Correlated ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Ru c&#8208;SACs) with tailored single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) of 9.3&#8197;&#197;, 7.0&#8197;&#197;, and 6.2&#8197;&#197; were prepared via organometallic design. The Ru c&#8208;SAC with 6.2&#8197;&#197; SAD exhibited superior uric acid electrooxidation activity due to the optimal inter&#8208;atomic distance facilitating a three&#8208;electron transfer pathway, substantiated by comprehensive experimental studies and theoretical computations, and unveiling atomic&#8208;level SAD&#8208;activity relationships in single&#8208;atom electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The overly simplistic geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a significant bottleneck in the field of single&#8208;atom sensing, impeding both the design of highly efficient electrochemical sensors and the establishment of structure&#8211;activity relationships. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy to boost the sensing performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by precisely tuning the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs). A series of Ru&#8208;based c&#8208;SACs (Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197;, Rud=7.0&#8201;&#197;, and Rud=9.3&#8201;&#197;) are synthesized with predetermined SAD values, which are comprehensively characterized by various techniques. Electrochemical studies on uric acid (UA) oxidation reveal that Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197; demonstrates an extraordinary sensitivity of 9.83&#8197;&#956;A &#956;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;2, which is superior to most of electrochemistry biosensors reported previously. Kinetic analysis and product examination unveil that the 6.2&#8197;&#197; Ru SAD instigates a distinctive three&#8208;electron oxidation of UA, with an extra electron transfer compared to the conventional two&#8208;electron pathway, which fundamentally enhances its sensitivity. Density functional theory calculations confirm the optimal SAD facilitates dual&#8208;site UA adsorption and accelerated charge transfer dynamics. This investigation provides novel insights into the strategic engineering of high&#8208;performance SAC&#8208;based electrochemical sensors by precisely controlling the atomic&#8208;scale structure of active sites.

         <title>Nucleation Engineering to Strengthen Interface Contacts in Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the nucleation barrier at the substrate surface, the nucleation process is prone to occur at the substrate, resulting in intimate interface contact, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed interface nonradiative recombination. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with improved thermal stability is achieved, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on single crystals hold potential for higher efficiency and stability, while the incomplete interface contact hinders hole carrier extraction and device performance.

&lt;p&gt;Through regulating the nucleation barrier at the substrate surface, the nucleation process is prone to occur at the substrate, resulting in intimate interface contact, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed interface nonradiative recombination. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with improved thermal stability is achieved, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single-crystal perovskite solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on single crystals hold potential for higher efficiency and stability, while the incomplete interface contact hinders hole carrier extraction and device performance.

         <title>Sequence Similarity Network Guided Discovery of a Dehydrogenase for Asymmetric Carbonyl Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive sequence similarity network based approach enabled the identification of a diverse array of uncharacterized enzymes from nature, leading to the discovery of several novel asymmetric carbonyl desaturation enzymes. Among them, the most outstanding enzyme, TgDH, demonstrated remarkable stereoselectivity and reactivity, catalyzing the synthesis of various chiral cyclohexenones bearing &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters with high efficiency.







Abstract
Carbonyl dehydrogenation is one of the most valuable transformations in modern synthetic chemistry. As compared to traditional chemical synthesis methods, enzymatic dehydrogenation offers a greener and more selective alternative. However, except for a few rare natural dehydrogenases for desaturation, current enzymatic methods predominantly rely on enzyme promiscuity, which often suffers from lower efficiency and limited reaction controllability. Herein, we employed sequence similarity networks to mine natural dehydrogenases from a vast array of sequences with potential dehydrogenation activity. This approach led to the discovery of an uncharacterized FAD&#8208;dependent enzyme capable of efficiently performing the desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones, thereby generating diverse cyclohexenones bearing remote &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. The current method has enhanced the turnover frequency (TOF) by approximately 178&#8208;fold as compared to the best existing biocatalytic strategies and displayed almost no overoxidation reactions. Through a combination of experimental assays and computational studies, we elucidated that this enzyme enhances its dehydrogenation capability through an unconventional proton relay system, absent in previously reported enzyme promiscuity systems. Additionally, this streamlined enzymatic process demonstrated scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis with maintained efficiency and selectivity, offering robust and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of chiral cyclohexenones with high optical purity.

         <title>Manipulating Crystal Packing in Heterocycloarenes by an Atom Engineering Strategy for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains in single&#8208;crystal form enable chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes to be systematically investigated for the first time. Notably, NS achieves a record&#8208;high mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), which enlarges the family of emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSCs with high mobility for practical applications.







Abstract
Developing (hetero)cycloarenes, an emerging class of ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications remains significantly constrained due to their synthetic challenge and limited diversity of available materials. Herein, a series of coplanar chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains were synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form, and chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes was investigated in detailed. Sulfur&#8208;fused NS exhibits a closest herringbone crystal packing with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance as low as 3.11&#8197;&#197;, resulting in a record&#8208;high hole mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped OSCs. Remarkably, selenium&#8208;fused NSe without intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in its crystalline state, also manifests the second highest mobility of up to 2.11&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is attributed to the presence of extensive short&#8208;range edge&#8208;to&#8208;face Se&#8230;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions. Furthermore, these heterocycloarenes exhibit a selective supramolecular interaction with C70, with the trend in binding constants being: NS &lt; NO &lt; NSe. Overall, this work not only systematically elucidates the role of atom engineering on heterocycloarenes for the first time, but also paves the way for practical applications of the emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSC materials.

         <title>Volatile Imide Additives with Large Dipole and Special Film Formation Kinetics Enable High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three volatile imide additives with large dipole moments which improved the performance of the OSCs device by manipulating the crystallization process of the acceptor were reported. These additives could induce the acceptor to first nucleate and then grow, forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains and improving charge transport. One of the highest power conversion efficiencies of 19.04% was achieved for D18:L8&#8208;BO devices treated with pClPA.







Abstract
Large dipole moment additives have strong interactions with the host materials, which can optimize morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these additives are difficult to remove due to their strong intermolecular interactions, which may impair stability. Developing volatile additives with large dipole moments is challenging. Herein, we first report volatile imide additives that could effectively improve the performance of OSCs through morphology modification. Three additives N&#8208;(o&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (oClPA), N&#8208;(m&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (mClPA), and N&#8208;(p&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (pClPA) were screened to investigate the effort of positional isomerization on molecular configuration and interaction. These additives (ClPAs) have larger dipole moments (2.0664 Debye for oClPA, 4.2361 Debye for mClPA, and 4.7896 Debye for pClPA) compared to reported solid additives. In contrast to traditional simultaneous nucleation and crystal growth, ClPAs could induce the acceptor to nucleate first and then grow, which contributes to forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains with better crystallinity. To our knowledge, this unique film formation kinetics was reported first. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 treated with pClPA was improved from 16.13&#8201;% to 18.58&#8201;%. Additive pClPA also performed well in PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:Y6, and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, and a high PCE of 19.04&#8201;% was achieved. Our results indicate using imide unit to construct solid additives is a simple and effective strategy, and the positional isomerization of halogen atom also has a large effect on the photovoltaic performance.

A cyclodipeptide platform delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures.

&lt;p&gt;Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution-processed bottom-up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures. It undergoes complicated pathway including the hierarchical organization of molecular blocks in a spontaneous and ordered manner.

Homochiral linear dipeptides bearing tyrosine and phenylglycine residue go through cyclization to afford cyclodipeptides, leading to the in situ reaction-induced aggregation into giant helices with ultra-high yields and phase purity.

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Blue&#8208;Emitting Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or v&#8208;DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.







Abstract
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). High&#8208;performance blue OLEDs still pose a considerable challenge. Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronic technologies. In this study, we designed a series of original high&#8208;triplet PHC materials based on a multi&#8208;substitution approach of the 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (SBF) backbone and used them, for the first time, as a host in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs. Devices based on the 2,6&#8208;bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR&#8208;TADF OLED devices based on v&#8208;DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQEmax of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Closed Four&#8208;Link Chains and Borromean Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (841links) and Borromean links (632 links) have been successfully synthesized in one&#8208;step processes. The interlocked molecules were generated by the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions of bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole ligands and binuclear Cp*Rh/Ir&#8208;based precursors.







Abstract
Despite substantial advancements in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), the efficient construction of higher order links remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the highly efficient one&#8208;step directed construction of a series of unprecedented molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (84 1 metalla&#8208;links), achieved through the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions involving binuclear rhodium/iridium precursors and bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligands. Meanwhile, modulating the substituent positions of the pyridine groups in the ligand resulted in a change in topological structure, leading to the formation of two molecular Borromean links (

metalla&#8208;links). The molecular configurations of the abovementioned metalla&#8208;links were clearly identified through mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, structural transformation between the molecular Borromean links and corresponding monocycles was achieved through concentration effects, as validated by solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy investigations.

         <title>Luminescent Alkylaluminium Anthranilates Reaching Unity Quantum Yield in the Condensed Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrameric alkylaluminium anthranilates have been synthesised that&#160;exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent photoluminescence performance. In one of the complexes,&#160;intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions have been found to lead to a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Transition, post&#8208;transition and rare earth metal complexes supported by (O,N)&#8208; and (N,N)&#8208;type ligands dominate organometallic photochemistry. However, despite a vast number of aminobenzoate metal complexes having been reported, and aluminium being globally abundant, alkylaluminium anthranilates have not yet been considered as effective luminophores. Herein, using a family of commercially available ligands composed of anthranilic acid (anth&#8208;H2) and its N&#8208;substituted derivatives, we report the isolation and characterisation of a series of unique tetrameric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal alkylaluminium anthranilates, [(R'&#8208;anth)AlR]4. The resulting compounds are characterised using spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction to analyse structure&#8208;determining factors in the solid state and solution. Moreover, by changing the N&#8208;substituents from H to Me and Ph, we have yielded a series of luminophores that exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent performance, providing a [(Ph&#8208;anth)AlEt]4 derivative that achieves a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase, which is unprecedented for aluminium complexes.

         <title>A Trimming&#8208;&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trimming&#8208;&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino&#8208;metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.







Abstract
Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming&#8208;&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation&#8208;after&#8208;coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four&#8208;point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz&#8208;based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&#8722;2 to 1.3&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc&#8208;based MOF counterparts. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra&#8208;small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with built&#8208;in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity&#8208;dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH3 and NO2 using a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V.

     alt="A Trimming-&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trimming-&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino-metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming-&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation-after-coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four-point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz-based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc-based MOF counterparts. Temperature-dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra-small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron-donating and -withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with built-in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity-dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Responsive Alginate Chains Rendered Sol&#8208;to&#8208;Gel Gradient Electrolyte towards Practical Ah&#8208;level Zinc Metal Pouch Cell</title>

         <dc:description>
A sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte was designed to break the trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity from aqueous electrolyte and the stable interface from hydrogel electrolyte, through the high ionic conductive bulk electrolyte and lean&#8208;water hydrogel&#8208;like state interface. This work paves a new way for electrolyte design towards pratical zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Zinc metal batteries have been considered as an appealing candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage devices, but are hindered by the instable interface. Herein, we design a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte through the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Zn2+ and alginate. The electrochemical gelation of alginate creates a gradient sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel interface and enables the high ionic conductivity, where vehicular mechanism dominated transport is maintained in the bulk electrolyte, while a lean&#8208;water hydrogel like state is created at the Zn/electrolyte interface to reduce water activity. The electrochemical active alginate undergoes a gelation process to form an egg&#8208;shell to confine the Zn2+, rendering a 2D growth mode and inhibiting dendrite growth. By taking the advantages of both fast ion transport and stable interface, the full cell based on Zn/VO2 achieved a stable cycling of 400 cycles at an industrial&#8208;level areal capacity of over 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity retention of 89.25&#8201;%. Additionally, we demonstrate the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell, which stably operates for over 200 cycles with an almost unity average coulombic efficiency (over 99.90&#8201;%). By demonstrating the remarkable performance, our work represents an advancement in zinc metal batteries toward a practical scale and is expected to set a stepping stone for transformative advancements in energy storage technologies.

         <title>A Druglike Ferrostatin&#8208;1 Analogue as a Ferroptosis Inhibitor and Photoluminescent Indicator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole as a bio&#8208;isostere of the ester group in Fer&#8208;1 not only provides druglike Ferfluor&#8208;1 with high potency and favorable blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability for a significant anti&#8208;ferroptosis effect in vivo, but also creates a unique ratiometric photoluminescent probe sensitive to the fluctuation of ferroptosis by an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) mechanism.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic applications have long suffered from a shortage of suitable drugs and probes of high specificity. In the context of anti&#8208;ferroptosis research for neurological diseases, the inaccessibility of a blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeable small molecular ferroptosis inhibitor, and the lack of specific ferroptosis probes, seriously impeded a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis and the development of clinically applicable drugs. We report herein a novel 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole&#8208;functionalized druglike ferrostatin analogue entitled Ferfluor&#8208;1 with superior anti&#8208;ferroptosis potency, favorable BBB permeability and in vivo activity against stroke and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the exclusive pseudo&#8208;excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) property of Ferfluor&#8208;1 via a long&#8208;distance hydrogen&#8208;bonding network makes it the first sensitive ratiometric photoluminescent probe to detect phospholipid hydroperoxides and a specific indicator for the fluctuation of ferroptosis. These unprecedented advantages not only make Ferfluor&#8208;1 a potential tool for ferroptosis&#8208;related diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the central nervous system, but also pave the way to developing new theragnostic agents for precision redox detection and regulation.

         <title>Dynamic Short Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network Enhancing Hydrophilicity in Biomimetic Membranes with Artificial Water Channels for Efficient Removal of Dyes and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated biomimetic membrane combining I&#8208;quartet water channels and sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide achieves simultaneous dye and salt rejection with high water permeance. Leveraging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, this design enhances antifouling performance and provides an energy&#8208;efficient solution for textile wastewater treatment.







Abstract
The development of an integrated biomimetic membrane capable of rejecting both dyes and salts in a single step, while sustaining stable water permeation, presents a promising solution for textile wastewater treatment. Herein, we report a novel integrated biomimetic membrane integrating an I&#8208;quartet artificial water channel (AWC) with sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide (PA&#8208;SO3H), which can stably reject both dyes and inorganic salts. The I&#8208;quartet channels (2.68&#8197;&#197;), formed via self&#8208;assembly of alkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole (HC8) molecules, facilitate selective water transport and rejection of both dyes and inorganic salts. Concurrently, the sulfonic acid groups (&#8722;SO3H) could grab water molecules, forming dynamic short hydrogen&#8208;bonding network (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O). These hydrogen bonds not only serve as jumping force, lowering the energy barrier for water transport through the alternating hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic matrix, but also act as an effective antifouling barrier, significantly reducing membrane fouling. The optimal HC83.0&#8208;PA&#8208;SO3H membrane exhibits a water permeance of 13.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8208;2&#8197;h&#8208;1&#8197;MPa&#8208;1, approximately 2.7&#8208;fold higher than that of the pristine PA membrane, and both high dyes and salts rejection efficiency. Moreover, the membrane sustains stable antifouling characteristics throughout a 19&#8208;day endurance test. This innovative membrane design provides a promising solution for the efficient separation of both dyes and inorganic salts in textile wastewater treatment.

         <title>Mussel Foot Protein Membrane&#8208;Enclosed Crystalline Drug with Zero&#8208;Order Release Kinetics for Long&#8208;Acting Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a mussel foot protein (Mfp) membrane&#8208;enclosed zero&#8208;order controlled release system by biomimicking the working principle of the mussel plaque. The thin membrane forms directly in situ on the surface of the crystalline drugs, achieving a high drug&#8208;loading capability. In streptozotocin&#8208;induced type 1 diabetic mice, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated insulin crystals can maintain blood glucose at normoglycemia for a week. Similarly, in healthy rats, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated progesterone crystals can maintain its plasma drug concentration for up to one week.







Abstract
Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half&#8208;life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane&#8208;enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro&#8208; and small&#8208;molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&gt;90&#8201;%). It exhibits sustained and zero&#8208;order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane&#8208;enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7&#8197;days. Meanwhile, membrane&#8208;coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7&#8197;days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35&#8197;days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and the treatment of distinct diseases.

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a mussel foot protein (Mfp) membrane-enclosed zero-order controlled release system by biomimicking the working principle of the mussel plaque. The thin membrane forms directly in situ on the surface of the crystalline drugs, achieving a high drug-loading capability. In streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice, a single injection of Mfp-encapsulated insulin crystals can maintain blood glucose at normoglycemia for a week. Similarly, in healthy rats, a single injection of Mfp-encapsulated progesterone crystals can maintain its plasma drug concentration for up to one week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half-life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane-enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro- and small-molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&amp;gt;90&#8201;%). It exhibits sustained and zero-order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane-enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7&#8197;days. Meanwhile, membrane-coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7&#8197;days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35&#8197;days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and the treatment of distinct diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Water Permeation in Positively Charged Water Channels: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The higher permeability of positively charged water channels Ch+ arises from shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes and faster water rotation at the entrance. This is due to weaker H&#8208;bond interactions of NH3+ groups with water compared to COO&#8722; groups in negatively charged channels Ch&#8722;, and K+ ions around COO&#8722; slowing water rotation more than Cl&#8722; ions around NH3+.







Abstract
The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCs is influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar[5]arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (Ch+) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (Ch&#8722;). The higher permeability of Ch+ channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of Ch+. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in Ch+ and Ch&#8722; channels: the direct interactions of the NH3+/COO&#8722; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&#8722;/K+) around these charged groups. NH3+ groups in Ch+ channels exert less stable H&#8208;bond interaction with water than the COO&#8722; group in Ch&#8722; channels. K+ ions concentrated around the COO&#8722; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&#8722; ions around the NH3+ groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance AWCs at the molecular level.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Ferrocenyl Aminoalcohols: Simultaneous Induction of Multiple Types of Chirality by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral ferrocenes with a chiral aminoalcohol group was developed via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. The desired products were obtained in excellent yield with high enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) by using phosphine&#8211;olefin ligands with a planar chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold.







Abstract
Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring&#8208;opening of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin ligand consisting of a cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring&#8208;opening products in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of the starting 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring&#8208;opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.

A Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V and a large CO partial current density of 608.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Integrated solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.

         <title>Ultrathin Polymersomes with Controllable Light&#8208;Responsivity via Adjusting the Electronic Effect from Para&#8208;Substituents of Azobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with vesicular thickness of ~2.0&#8197;nm were crafted using the self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs). The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transition toward these UTPS was achieved owing to the photo&#8208;isomerization feature of azobenzenes, where the isomerization rate of these UTPS is highly dependent on the electronic effect of the para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release performance using these light&#8208;responsive UTPSs as carriers proved the potential on bionanotechnology.







Abstract
Achieving ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with controllable light&#8208;responsive kinetics poses a prospective strategy to address the growing demands of intelligent and miniature systems, but it remains challenging. Herein, we reported the self&#8208;assembly of numerous side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs) into a series of UTPSs with diameters spanning 210&#8211;270&#8197;nm and ultrathin vesicular thickness spanning 1.91&#8211;2.14&#8197;nm. The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transitions for these UTPSs are rendered by the photo&#8208;isomerization of azobenzene moiety upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light. The systematical isomerization kinetic study proved that the light&#8208;responsive rate of distinct UTPSs was highly dependent on the electronic effect of para&#8208;substituents of azobenzenes within AAACs. Notably, the rate constant of electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro&#8208;modified UTPSs was 6.7&#8197;times greater than that of electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl&#8208;modified UTPSs. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release activity for different UTPSs was evaluated using a hydrophilic model drug of methylene blue (MB), with a light&#8208;controllable releasing performance that highly depended on the para&#8208;substituent&#8208;induced light&#8208;responsive kinetics. Our work offers an innovative strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a controllable responsive performance for the targeted applications in bionanotechnology.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with vesicular thickness of ~2.0&#8197;nm were crafted using the self-assembly of side-chain-type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs). The light-triggered reversible size transition toward these UTPS was achieved owing to the photo-isomerization feature of azobenzenes, where the isomerization rate of these UTPS is highly dependent on the electronic effect of the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituted azobenzenes. The proof-of-concept cargo release performance using these light-responsive UTPSs as carriers proved the potential on bionanotechnology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ionogels from Dynamic Polyrotaxane&#8208;Based Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes were designed by introducing ionic liquid to dynamically crosslinked polyrotaxane networks. The competitive coordination of lithium ions between the polymer chain segments and the ionic liquid molecular clusters facilitates lithium&#8208;ion migration. The ionogel electrolyte enables lithium symmetrical cells with stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours and the NMC622||Li battery with excellent rate and cycling performance at 20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The swelling of a polymer matrix by ionic liquids and additional lithium salts may lead to the formation of ionogel electrolytes. However, the introduction of additional ions usually results in a decreased lithium&#8208;ion transference number, because of the trapping of the lithium ions in clusters and polymer&#8208;ion complexes. Achieving highly efficient lithium&#8208;ion migration and increasing lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium&#8208;ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and tLi+=0.45 at 20&#8201;&#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium&#8208;lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20&#8201;&#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03&#8201;%). This work provides new insights for the design and synthesis of ionogel electrolytes, facilitating lithium ion migration within the electrolytes.

         <title>Modulated Multicomponent Reaction Pathway by Pore&#8208;Confinement Effect in MOFs for Highly Efficient Catalysis of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully modulated reaction pathway in the multicomponent reaction of propargylic amines, phosphine oxide and CO2 through the confinement effect of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a catalyst. The MOF with pores of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; can selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, preferentially react to form oxazolidinones, which further react with the phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce the final product. This result in high catalytic performance and excellent substrate generality.







Abstract
The conversion of flue gas CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals via multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers the advantages of atom economy, bond&#8208;formation efficiency and product complexity. However, because of the competition between reaction sequences and pathways among substrates, the efficient synthesize the desired product is a great challenge. Herein, a porous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free framework (Cu&#8208;TCA) was synthesized, which can highly effectively catalyze the multicomponent conversion of CO2 by modulating reaction pathways. The pores with the size of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; in Cu&#8208;TCA selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, At the same time, the larger&#8208;sized phosphine oxide is hindered outside the pores. Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO2 and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in Cu&#8208;TCA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of Cu&#8208;TCA with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Negative Hydrogen with Bimetallic&#8208;Ternary&#8208;Structured Catalysts for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen evolution form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1 and achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours using AB as H in converting nitrobenzene to anilines.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) with in situ negative hydrogen (H&#8722;) has received extensive attention as an alternative to conventional high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation processes. However, the insufficient activity of hydrogen production and unclear the conversion process of hydrogenation remain a great challenge. In this work, brand new bimetallic ternary&#8208;structured catalysts (Ru1+nM1&#8208;TiO2, M=Co, Cu, Fe, Ni) were synthesized to efficiently generate H&#8722; donors from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under moderate conditions. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen production form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours in converting nitrobenzene to anilines using AB. Mechanistic studies revealed that the high hydrolysis activity was due to that the Ru SA and Co SA sites of the bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalyst required the lowest energy for the activation of AB and H2O, respectively. Remarkably, the Co SA and Ru clusters exhibited an obvious synergistic effect in the TH process, which promoted the tandem hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. This work demonstrated an efficient approach to generate H&#8722; donor with bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts in TH process and further provided new inspiration on the development of multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme Surface Residues Direct Encapsulation into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Performance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to guide the formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by exposing surface residues of proteins, thereby embedding enzymes into MOFs. Nitrogen&#8208;enriched Cyt&#8197;c serves as a model to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, leading to significantly improve enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency. The strategy is applicable for a variety of enzymes, demonstrating the potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Herein, we highlight the role of nitrogen&#8208;enriched surface groups on proteins in directing topological transformations of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Using a modified&#8208;protein&#8208;directed MOFs template synthesis (mDTS) strategy, we demonstrate that these surface modifications on cytochrome c (Cyt&#8197;c) selectively induce the formation of leaf&#8208;like zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;L). This approach not only enables a structural transition from ZIF&#8208;8 to a more open ZIF&#8208;L framework but also substantially enhances the catalytic activity and loading of Cyt&#8197;c beyond traditional immobilization methods. Adjusting the concentration of the surface modifier allows for precise tuning of the Cyt&#8197;c activity, allowing optimal enzyme function at specific modifier levels. Furthermore, our results reveal that surface modifications of a variety of proteins can facilitate the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, emphasizing the broad applicability of the mDTS method. This approach offers significant promise for developing highly efficient protein&#8208;MOF composites, offering transformative potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Reduction and Biosynthesis Towards Sustainable CO2 Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

This work delivers a photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis tandem strategy towards upgrading CO2 into long&#8208;chain sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene, which offers a sustainable paradigm for CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added compounds.







Abstract
Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO2) into long&#8208;chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value&#8208;added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO2 reduction to energy&#8208;rich sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8722;ZnO). The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8722;ZnO preferentially reduces CO2 to CH4 with a production rate of 1539.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 90&#8201;%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#946;+). Subsequently, Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene using photocatalytically&#8208;obtained CH4 as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. This study provides a green, low&#8208;energy pathway for the synthesis of long&#8208;chain compounds from CO2 as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long&#8208;term energy demands and sustainable CO2 upcycling.

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given that chiral bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are stacked straight forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assembly, eight assemblies with different symmetries can be considered. In this study, seven of eight assemblies are selectively synthesized with minimal alternations in their molecular structures. These assemblies will be useful for the quantitative discussion for structure&#8211;property relationship.







Abstract
Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of Alkenes and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a new masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent that enables previously inaccessible radical chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of alkenes, as well as highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of heteroarenes. The method involves conversion of the weakly electrophilic bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate into a masked electrophile, significantly increasing its reactivity, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Structural modification of drug candidates with fluorine atoms has revolutionized drug discovery, frequently enhancing pharmacological properties. However, the strategic integration of privileged bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol moiety remains challenging, primarily due to the overreliance on closed&#8208;shell strategies typically involving toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. Alternative radical&#8208;based strategies exist but are constrained by the inherently weak electrophilicity of the key bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate, significantly limiting the scope of accessible transformations. Here we report the development of a novel masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent, enabling the efficient generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical species with significantly enhanced electrophilicity under mild photocatalytic conditions. This approach facilitates chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates 515 candidate structures featuring a planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atom, adhering to the 18 valence electron rule and formulated as OXnYmq. Among these, 35 global minima were identified, primarily stabilized by Group 13 elements with charge states spanning &#8722;1 to +1. Notably, bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions&#8212;from covalent to polar ionic&#8212;that challenge traditional assumptions about unconventional oxygen bonding motifs.







Abstract
Planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atoms are rare, with only a few examples confirmed to date. This study systematically investigates 515 potential structures, formulated as OXnYmq, where n+m=4, q ranging from +2 to &#8722;2, and following the 18&#8208;valence electron rule. High&#8208;level ab initio calculations identified 35 global minima containing a ptO atom, predominantly stabilized by Group&#8197;13 elements. Bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions, from covalent to polar ionic, and confirms high electron delocalization. The findings challenge traditional bonding paradigms, improve the understanding of ptO&#8208;containing clusters, and propose viable ptO clusters for gas&#8208;phase detection, advancing the study of unconventional oxygen bonding.

Notably, bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions&#8212;from covalent to polar ionic&#8212;that challenge traditional assumptions about unconventional oxygen bonding motifs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atoms are rare, with only a few examples confirmed to date. This study systematically investigates 515 potential structures, formulated as OX&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;=4, &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; ranging from +2 to &#8722;2, and following the 18-valence electron rule. High-level ab initio calculations identified 35 global minima containing a ptO atom, predominantly stabilized by Group&#8197;13 elements. Bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions, from covalent to polar ionic, and confirms high electron delocalization. The findings challenge traditional bonding paradigms, improve the understanding of ptO-containing clusters, and propose viable ptO clusters for gas-phase detection, advancing the study of unconventional oxygen bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Boosted Stability and Kinetics under a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce silk fibroin (SF) as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, boosting the reaction kinetics and cycling stability of aqueous Zn ion batteries across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. SF disrupts H&#8208;bond networks in H2O and coordinates Zn2+, reducing viscosity and suppressing side reactions. It also forms a hydrophilic/zincophilic SF&#8208;film on both electrodes, enabling uniform Zn plating and preventing cathode dissolution.







Abstract
Sustainable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) necessitate a wide operational temperature range to ensure practicability, yet achieving this often compromises either reaction kinetics at low temperatures or cycling stability at high temperatures. Here we present an electrolyte design that balances this trade&#8208;off, enhancing the stability and kinetics of AZIBs across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Our approach incorporates silk fibroin as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, which modifies both electrolyte structure and electrode interphase. Specifically, Zn||Zn half&#8208;cells with this electrolyte realize low hysteresis (180&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and stable operation (200&#8197;hours at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This electrolyte is compatible with both inorganic and organic cathode materials. Remarkably, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level Zn||V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&#8722;1 with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy provides a powerful solution to the challenges of aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries at extreme temperatures.

         <title>From Holodirected to Hemidirected Coordination Activated by Oxygenation Strategy: A Facile Route to Long Wave Infrared Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair electrons of Sb3+ in halides can be activated by oxygen atom, which inspired the creation of the first alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalide Rb2Sb2OCl6. Its birefringence has been increased by an order of magnitude compared with the holodirected coordination Rb13Sb8Cl37. Large&#8208;sized crystal measurements show that Rb2Sb2OCl6 features a good transmittance from 0.4 to 13.5&#8197;&#956;m, covering the near, mid and long wave infrared range, confirming its potential as a long wave infrared birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Long wave infrared (LWIR) birefringent crystals are essential for infrared optical applications but such materials are rarely reported due to the requirements of large birefringence and wide infrared transmission range. This study proposes a facile route to create new LWIR birefringent crystal by oxygenation strategy in halides with cations containing lone pair electrons. Given the tendency of such cations to form holodirected geometry, a divalent oxygen was introduced to substitute the monovalent halogen to decrease the coordination number and activate the lone pair electrons. Our efforts in Rb+&#8208;Sb3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; system result three new structures, namely, Rb13Sb8Cl37, Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6. The holodirected SbCl6 in Rb13Sb8Cl37 has been successfully translated to hemidirected SbOCl4 in Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6, which are the first examples in alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides. The birefringence of Rb2Sb2OCl6 reached to 0.191@550&#8197;nm, which is 11.2 times that of Rb13Sb8Cl37 (0.017@550&#8197;nm). Large&#8208;sized crystal of Rb2Sb2OCl6 have been successfully grown (6&#215;6&#215;2&#8197;mm3). It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4&#8211;13.5&#8197;&#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system &#8211; alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.

         <title>Re and Ru Co&#8208;Doped Transition Metal Alloy as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Electrooxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru and Re co&#8208;doped NiCoFe alloy exhibited efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. By employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously with a stable operation over 450&#8197;h.







Abstract
Glycerol electrooxidation (GOR), as an innovative strategy for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, is considered a promising anodic alternative to oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalysis. However, the high potential and the limited selectivity and faradaic efficiency impede the industrial&#8208;scale application toward GOR. Herein, we for the first time constructed rhenium and ruthenium co&#8208;doped transition metal alloy (NiCoFeRuRe) for the efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. Benefiting from the rapid generation of M3+&#8208;OOH induced by Ru element and the inhibition of OER and excessive oxidation of glycerol by Re species through in situ chacterization, the optimized NiCoFeRuRe requires only 1.133 VRHE to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a faradaic efficiency of 95.6&#8201;% for formate product with a stability more than 450&#8197;h. Importantly, employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously, which is 265&#8197;mV lower than the electrolytic water splitting owning an excellent stability of 350&#8197;h. This work provides a facile strategy for rationally designing high&#8208;performance GOR catalysts for biomass upgradings.

         <title>Co Nanoparticle: An Efficient H&#8208;pump for Pt Single Atoms Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover</title>

A facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy is applied to create NMP&#8208;SACs consisting of Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC) for exceptional HER activity. As an H&#8208;pump, Con supply hydrogen for Pt1 sites through accelerated water dissociation, enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.







Abstract
Introducing OH&#8208;interaction sites to accelerate water dissociation can increase hydrogen coverage on active site surfaces and thus accelerate H&#8208;spillover, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent studies on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) combined with nano&#8208;metal&#8208;particles (NMPs) have developed various homologous NMP&#8208;SACs, however, synthesizing the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs remains a significant challenge. Particularly for HER catalysts under alkaline conditions, the ideal heterologous structure requires a synergy between non&#8208;noble NMPs with strong oxophilicity and noble&#8208;metal SAs with suitable hydrogen binding energy. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy to create the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs, comprising Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC). This catalyst demonstrates outstanding HER activity and superior stability in alkaline electrolyzer. Calculations reveal that Co nanoparticles serve as an H&#8208;pump, dissociating water to supply hydrogen to Pt1 sites, thereby enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.

         <title>Niobium Phosphide&#8208;Induced Sulfur Cathode Interface with Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Flux Enables Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Catalytic Conversion</title>

NbP induces the decomposition of lithium salts, which resulting in the formation of a LiF&#8208; and LiN&#8208;rich interfacial layer at the sulfur cathode interface for facilitating high&#8208;flux Li+ transport. The optimized interface reduces the conversion energy barrier of Li2S and effectively prevents the passivation of catalytic active sites.







Abstract
Research on the Li&#8722;S catalytic chemistry primarily focus on the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts and the exploration of their reaction mechanisms, with limited attention given to the impact on the interface at the cathode. Moreover, regulating the Li+ flux at the cathode interface can enhance Li2S conversion kinetics without compromising the intrinsic catalytic activity of catalyst. This work presents a paradigm that employs interface regulation to enhance Li&#8722;S battery (LSB) cycling stability. A novel phosphorus doped carbon supported niobium phosphide nanocrystals (NbP/PC) catalyst is developed and demonstrates exceptional intrinsic activity for lithium polysulfide conversion while it facilitates lithium salt dissociation through intermolecular hybridization. The NbP&#8208;induced functional interface layer with abundant LiF and Li3N provides efficient Li+ transport channel for Li2S decomposition, which further mitigates the passivation of active sites. In consequence, the assembled LSB exhibits a capacity retention rate of 0.04&#8201;% per cycle after 1100 cycles at a 1&#8197;C. Furthermore, the pouch battery with an energy density of 451&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 maintains stable performance over 20 cycles. This strategy addresses the limitations of traditional catalytic material design in the chemical regulation of the cathodic interface for promising future of LSBs.

         <title>Synthesis of Selenium&#8208;Doped Heteroacenes: Unveiling the External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes have been synthesized to unveil the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host molecules. Compared to oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based analogues, selenium&#8208;embedded host enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling, accelerates reverse intersystem crossing, and improves bipolar transport, enabling the assembly of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a wide color gamut.







Abstract
The internal heavy&#8208;atom effect (IHAE) has garnered considerable attention as a promising approach for developing highly efficient emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host materials, despite being equally important, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce a selenium&#8208;doping strategy to unlock the potential of EHAE in host molecules. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a straightforward method for synthesizing structurally diverse pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes via an intramolecular radical cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylselanyl)pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;amine derivatives. This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz&#8208;BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BFP) and sulfur&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz&#8208;BSeP significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz&#8208;BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high&#8208;performance, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut TADF&#8208;OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off. Additionally, its successful application in phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph&#8208;OLEDs) and TADF&#8208;sensitized narrowband red fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) highlights its versatility in advancing OLED technologies.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Bromine Battery with Highly Reversible Bromine Conversion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

ZnSO4 solution is initially screened as the electrolyte for bromide cathodes. Subsequently, a targeted sequestration strategy is proposed to modify KBr cathode, achieving high&#8208;reversibility bromine conversion chemistry. In situ Raman spectra reveal a Br3&#8722;/Br&#8722;&#8208;dominated conversion mechanism. A large&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;Br pouch cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 98.46&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92&#8201;% after 775 cycles at 3&#8197;C.







Abstract
Br2/Br&#8722; conversion reaction with a high operating potential (1.85&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn) is promising for designing high&#8208;energy cathodes in aqueous Zn batteries. However, the ultrahigh solubility of polybromides causes significant shuttle effects, capacity deterioration, and self&#8208;discharge, rendering the study of static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries still in its infancy. Here, various aqueous zinc salt electrolytes are first screened, showing that, compared to other salts, ZnSO4 is more suitable for Br&#8208;based cathodes benefiting from its higher negative charge density and lower cost. Nevertheless, the significant shuttle effect of polybromides remains in such an electrolyte. We further develop a targeted sequestration strategy to fundamentally confine polybromide migration from KBr cathode into electrolyte. In high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading (22 mgKBr cm&#8722;2) pouch cells, the average Coulombic efficiency enhances from 92.3&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;%, and self&#8208;discharge performance dramatically improves from 17.4&#8201;% capacity retention to 85.2&#8201;% after 72&#8197;h of resting, indicating the effectiveness of our strategy in confining the shuttle effects. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell delivers an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.88&#8201;% and a zinc utilization of 22&#8201;% at a high rate of 3&#8197;C. Our findings also pave the way for the design of advanced Br&#8208;based cathodes.

A catalytic enantioselective ring&#8208;opening strategy enables the development of unique planar chiral ferrocenes with chiral aminoalcohols. In their Research Article (e202502299), Ken Kamikawa et&#160;al. present the simultaneous induction of two central chiralities and planar chirality in ferrocenes. The cover image showcases the highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral ferrocenes induced by planar chiral cyclopentadienyl manganese ligands. The origin of asymmetry was elucidated through density functional calculations.

The present menace: Emissions of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8212;forever chemicals&#8212;represent a risk for the environment and human health. However, mitigation strategies lack. In their Minireview (e202424718), Patrick Lott, Florian Maurer, and Arik Beck discuss a roadmap on how to tackle PFAS emission in the gas phase using catalysis. Their cover art pays tribute to the iconic movie poster of the masterpiece Star Wars Episode 1, showing a CF4 molecule shadowing its past as long&#8208;chain PFAS onto a catalyst surface.

A novel mechanochemical&#8208;assisted approach converts elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymers with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) junctions, mimicking natural leaves for efficient CO2 photoreduction with H2O, without additional photosensitizers, sacrificial agents, or cocatalysts. The key innovation is a mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction, enabling sustainable solid&#8208;state condensation of sulfur with 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes to form bent thianthrene units.

         <title>Sustainable Pathways for the Synthesis of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite) plays a key role in construction as a hydraulic binder. Due to its instability in water, industrial production primarily relies on thermal dehydration of gypsum. This review examines alternative, potentially more sustainable methods for the synthesis of bassanite, including gypsum conversion at lower temperatures and direct precipitation from organic solvents or in the presence of specific additives. The benefits, drawbacks, and overall impact on sustainability of the different proposed approaches are critically assessed.







Abstract
Calcium sulfate, and especially its hemihydrate form (bassanite), is crucial in the construction industry, primarily used as a hydraulic binder in cements, mortars, and wallboards. Because of the rapid transformation of bassanite into thermodynamically stable gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) upon contact with water, natural deposits are scarce, rendering it one of the most extensively produced inorganic materials worldwide. Currently, bassanite is derived from mined or waste gypsum through a thermal dehydration process, which is energy&#8208;intensive and costly. As sustainability has become a key target for industrial processes and products, a series of studies aiming to increase the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of bassanite production was published recently. Two primary approaches are pursued: conversion of gypsum and direct precipitation of bassanite from solution. In both cases, organic solvents, (specific) additives and/or elevated temperatures have been used to control the activity/availability of water in the reaction medium and thus direct phase selection towards bassanite. This review offers a comprehensive overview of alternative bassanite production methods, critically examining their benefits, potential downsides, and overall impact on the sustainability of industrial&#8208;scale use.

         <title>Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of PFAS emission abatement, this minireview addresses catalytic gas phase PFAS decomposition and the associated overarching challenges involving fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and reaction engineering. In addition, concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions are introduced.







Abstract
While the outstanding stability of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) paved the way for their widespread application in a huge variety of applications, it also resulted in their nickname &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221;. The rising awareness for PFAS&#8208;related environmental and health concerns drives a discussion on the most effective ways to abate PFAS emissions into the environment, i.e. water, soil, and air, and remediation of contaminated matter. In order to address the knowledge gap regarding air pollution by PFAS, this minireview summarizes the current corpus of work in the field and outlines how catalysis can contribute to PFAS abatement in the gas phase. Beyond a mere collection of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, overarching challenges in catalytic PFAS removal are identified, spanning from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, i.e. C&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation, to heterogeneous catalysis, i.e. surface reactions at the gas&#8208;solid interface, to reaction engineering, i.e. scaling relations and technical hurdles. In addition, the article introduces concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions.

&lt;p&gt;In the context of PFAS emission abatement, this minireview addresses catalytic gas phase PFAS decomposition and the associated overarching challenges involving fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and reaction engineering. In addition, concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions are introduced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the outstanding stability of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) paved the way for their widespread application in a huge variety of applications, it also resulted in their nickname &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221;. The rising awareness for PFAS-related environmental and health concerns drives a discussion on the most effective ways to abate PFAS emissions into the environment, i.e. water, soil, and air, and remediation of contaminated matter. In order to address the knowledge gap regarding air pollution by PFAS, this minireview summarizes the current corpus of work in the field and outlines how catalysis can contribute to PFAS abatement in the gas phase. Beyond a mere collection of state-of-the-art knowledge, overarching challenges in catalytic PFAS removal are identified, spanning from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, i.e. C&#8722;F-bond activation, to heterogeneous catalysis, i.e. surface reactions at the gas-solid interface, to reaction engineering, i.e. scaling relations and technical hurdles. In addition, the article introduces concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereoelements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights recent advances in the construction of nonadjacent stereogenic elements and summarizes the various strategies employed, including bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis, and other approaches. The synthetic applications and mechanistic investigations are also discussed to facilitate understanding of this field.








Abstract
Nonadjacent chiral scaffolds are privileged motifs in bioactive molecules and medicines, which have stimulated chemists&#8217; ingenuity in achieving the asymmetric construction of non&#8208;contiguous chiral elements directly. Current strategies include bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis and others, enabling the production of a wide range of enantiomerically enriched compounds featuring different combinations of nonadjacent chirality, including multiple elements of central chirality, central and allenyl axial chirality, and central and biaryl axial chirality. As compared to the patterns of multiple nonadjacent elements of central chirality, the latter two are less frequently reported. This minireview aims to summarize the key developments in reaction design, mechanistic studies, and synthetic applications, with the goal of stimulating further exploration in this important area of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Sulfur Conversion to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder Polymer Networks through Mechanochemical Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state synthetic approach was developed to directly convert elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor molecular junctions, by exploiting mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting sulfur&#8208;rich conjugated polymer exhibits successful CO2 photoreduction with H2O vapor, without adding any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of synthetic methods capable of converting elemental sulfur into conjugated porous sulfur&#8208;rich polymers remains a great challenge, although direct utilization of this readily available feedstock can significantly enrich its uses and circumvent environmental problems during sulfur storage. We report herein mechanochemical (MC) nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) that enables sulfur conversion into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) molecular junctions. We demonstrate that the key lies in the generation of bent thianthrene units through a solid&#8208;state ball&#8208;milling condensation reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes and elemental sulfur. We also show that the assembling of D&#8722;A structural motifs into porous networks affords efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. Exceptional photoinduced charge separation along with boosted exciton dissociation results in a high&#8208;performance of carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 306.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by H2O oxidation to O2, as confirmed by both experimental and theoretical results. We anticipate this novel MC SNAr approach will advance processing techniques for direct sulfur utilization and facilitate new possibilities for the synthesis of D&#8722;A ladder polymer networks with promising potential in photocatalysis.

         <title>Profiling Allosteric Modulators of CB1R with an Allosteric Fluoroprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based assay to directly profile CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) independently of orthosteric radioligands. Our fluorescent tracer allows for distinction between allosteric and orthosteric ligands and reliable determination of CB1R AM binding affinities. (TOC Figure created in BioRender. Ganzoni, R.

Abstract
Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET&#8208;based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB1R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB1R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB1R with comparable affinity (pKi=5.34 and 5.67, respectively).

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Highly O&#8208;Glycosylated MUC7 Glycopeptides for Probing Inhibitory Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of four highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing different glycoforms has been achieved via an efficient chemoenzymatic approach, relying on the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that sialylated glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
MUC7, a highly glycosylated protein in saliva and respiratory tract, plays potential roles in facilitating bacterial clearance and preventing microbial invasion. The complexity of glycan structures and multiplicity of glycosylation sites of MUC7 make it very difficult to explore accurate biofunctions against pathogens. Here, we report an efficiently convergent chemoenzymatic approach to firstly synthesize highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing various glycoforms via the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and enzymatic&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that different glycoforms of synthetic MUC7 glycopeptides mediate unique activities against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among which sialylated MUC7 glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity and has the potential to develop antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Cocatalyst for Hydroquinone Oxidation Enables Aerobic Oxidation of Primary Alcohols to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A commercially available heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst supports efficient aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone, outperforming homogeneous molecular cobalt and iron cocatalysts that have been used to support redox cascades. This Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/benzoquinone cocatalyst system supports the highly efficient oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a homogeneous Ir catalyst in organic solvent.







Abstract
Benzoquinone (BQ) is commonly used as a cocatalyst in multi&#8208;component catalyst systems for aerobic oxidation of organic molecules. Such methods often proceed by a redox cascade in which a secondary catalyst supports aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) to BQ. The present study shows that a commercially available non&#8208;precious metal heterogeneous catalyst, PAJ&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, is much more efficient than established homogeneous catalysts for aerobic oxidation of HQ to BQ, and this improved reactivity is crucial to support aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with the homogeneous iridium catalyst, [Ir(trop2DAD]OTf (trop2DAD=N,N&#8208;bis(5&#8208;H&#8208;dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene). The combination of this heterogeneous/homogeneous catalyst system operates with Ir catalyst loadings as low as 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover frequencies &#8805;350&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Reinforced Nonlinear Optical Performances Induced by P&#8208;P Homoatomic Bond in Phosphide SrIn3Si4P11</title>

The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn3Si4P11 demonstrates superior second&#8208;harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn3Si4P9.







Abstract
Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi&#8208;asymmetric&#8208;module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn3Si4P11, which showcases the characteristics of a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si3P10] and [In3P10] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8722;P bond distinguishes SrIn3Si4P11 from the kindred SrIn3Si4P9, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30&#8208;fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50&#8197;eV broadening in band gap compared to SrIn3Si4P9. Theoretically calculated analysis reveals that the &#960; interactions and the significant polarization anisotropy of the P&#8722;P bond are critical factors contributing to the enhancement of NLO performances. The present study uncovers the pivotal significance of P&#8722;P bond in structural design and NLO properties optimization, and delineates a clear research direction for the extensive advancement of phosphides NLO materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Arylations and Alkenylations of 2&#8208;Aminobiaryls with Atmospheric Air as the Sole Oxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a mild, enantioselective method for the arylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aminobiaryl compounds to produce highly valuable, enantioenriched anilines exhibiting axial chirality. The kinetic resolution process is catalyzed by Pd(II) in combination with an isobutyryl&#8208;protected isoleucine ligand (iBoc&#8208;Ile&#8208;OH), using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant and DMSO as cosolvent. The products can be divergently manipulated to give optically active, axially chiral derivatives of high interest for asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Optically active 2&#8208;aminobiaryls are valuable chiral frameworks with broad applications in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present a simple and practical methodology for their asymmetric synthesis via enantioselective palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations or alkenylations of racemic precursors. The methodology utilizes a kinetic resolution strategy, producing two highly valuable enantioenriched axially chiral molecules: the C&#8722;C coupling product and the unreacted starting material. Notably, we have established reaction conditions that enable the in situ regeneration of the active Pd(II) catalyst using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of this approach by preparing several derivatives relevant to the field of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Enzyme Controlled Transient Phospholipid Vesicles for Regulated Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the in situ formation of a phospholipid and its chemical energy driven assembly into transient vesicles. Our synthetic phospholipid vesicles, which are uniform and 65&#8197;nm in diameter, were obtained by a metabolism&#8208;like process i.e., formation by simply mixing the precursors and simultaneous degradation by an enzyme. This results in temporally controlled vesicles. Moreover, the cargo release from our vesicles can be dynamically regulated for drug delivery.







Abstract
Metabolism in biological systems involves the continuous formation and breakdown of chemical and structural components, driven by chemical energy. In specific, metabolic processes on cellular membranes result in in situ formation and degradation of the constituent phospholipid molecules, by consuming fuel, to dynamically regulate the properties. Synthetic analogs of such chemically fueled phospholipid vesicles have been challenging. Here we report a bio&#8208;inspired approach for the in situ formation of phospholipids, from water soluble precursors, and their fuel driven self&#8208;assembly into vesicles. We show that the kinetic competition between anabolic and catabolic&#8208;like reactions leads to the formation and enzymatic degradation of the double&#8208;tailed, vesicle&#8208;forming phospholipid. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis demonstrate the formation of transient vesicles whose lifetime can be easily tuned from minutes to hours. Importantly, our design results in the formation of uniform sized (65&#8197;nm) vesicles simply by mixing the precursors, thus avoiding the traditional complex methods. Finally, our sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm vesicles are of the right size for application in drug delivery. We have demonstrated that the release kinetics of the incorporated cargo molecules can be dynamically regulated for potential applications in adaptive nanomedicine.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry in a Capillary Applied to the Facilitation of the Crystalline Sponge Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;One&#8208;droplet&#8221; host&#8211;guest chemistry was achieved by using a glass capillary, enabling the efficient crystallization and structure determination of various host&#8211;guest complexes. Two coordination hosts, the cage and the crystalline sponge (CS), were examined. Notably, using a capillary addressed several persistent technical challenges in the CS method, greatly simplifying and accelerating the analysis of molecular structures.







Abstract
Capillary is a handy tool for transferring, mixing, and storing small volumes of liquid. Here, we show that the stepwise dipping of host and guest solutions into a capillary allows efficient preparation, crystallization, and X&#8208;ray analysis of various host&#8211;guest complexes. The crystals formed in capillaries are comparable in quality to those grown in regular flasks and subjected to X&#8208;ray analysis without being removed from the capillary. We further apply the capillary technique to the crystalline sponge method, a practical domain of host&#8211;guest chemistry, successfully overcoming several technical issues.

Two coordination hosts, the cage and the crystalline sponge (CS), were examined. Notably, using a capillary addressed several persistent technical challenges in the CS method, greatly simplifying and accelerating the analysis of molecular structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capillary is a handy tool for transferring, mixing, and storing small volumes of liquid. Here, we show that the stepwise dipping of host and guest solutions into a capillary allows efficient preparation, crystallization, and X-ray analysis of various host&#8211;guest complexes. The crystals formed in capillaries are comparable in quality to those grown in regular flasks and subjected to X-ray analysis without being removed from the capillary. We further apply the capillary technique to the crystalline sponge method, a practical domain of host&#8211;guest chemistry, successfully overcoming several technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium Anionic Dicarbenes or Acetylides: What is in the Name?</title>

The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called lithium anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC). X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies reveal that Li(ADC) exist as lithium acetylides Li(ACT). Exposure of Li(ACT) to CO2 and N2O readily afford ADC&#8208;compounds Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] and Li[(ADC)N2O], respectively.







Abstract
The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts (IPr&#8208;Ar)X (1&#8208;Ar)X (IPr&#8208;Ar = ArC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Ar = Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (2&#8208;Ar) (ADC = ArC{N(Dipp)C}2). 2&#8208;Ar can be used to prepare a variety of main group heterocycles, however their structures in the solid&#8208;state remained hitherto unknown. Herein reported single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal an acetylide type [ArC{N(Dipp)}(Dipp)NC&#8801;CLi)]n (3&#8208;Ar) dimeric (n = 2) or trimeric (n = 3) molecular structure for 2&#8208;Ar. Treatment of 3&#8208;Ph with Et3B cleanly yields the monoanionic carbene Li[(ADC)(BEt3)] (4&#8208;Ph) featuring a weakly coordinating anion embedded in the same molecular entity. 3&#8208;Ar readily undergo reactions with CO2 and N2O to form the ring&#8208;closing products Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] (5&#8208;Ar) and Li[(ADC)N2O] (6&#8208;Ar), respectively.

         <title>Borohydride Oxidation as Counter Reaction in Reductive Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, anodic borohydride oxidation is demonstrated to have great potential for successfully replacing sacrificial metal anodes in a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic counter reaction effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 at inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.







Abstract
An efficient reaction at the counter electrode is of key importance for the success of net oxidative and net reductive electrochemical transformations. For electrooxidative processes, cathodic proton reduction to H2 serves as the benchmark counter reaction. In contrast, net reductive electrochemical transformations have less attractive oxidative counter reactions to choose from and commonly rely on dissolution of a sacrificial anode that effectively results in stoichiometric metal consumption for the processes. In this study, we demonstrate that anodic borohydride oxidation has great potential to successfully replace the use of such sacrificial anodes for a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic transformation effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 using inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Dual Ammonia Activation and Transfer by an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Boryloxy Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the first single&#8208;site main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dual activation of ammonia (NH3) to hydrogen (H2) using a low&#8208;valent aluminyl compound. This transformation is driven by a (coordination/proton shuttling) N&#8722;H oxidative addition pathway and selective protonolysis. These findings highlight the potential of main&#8208;group complexes in traditionally transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dominated transformations.







Abstract
The reactivity of an N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligated aluminyl compound has been harnessed for main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative dual activation of ammonia. The Al(I) system K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al] reacts with excess NH3 to give the Al(III) bis(amide) K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] and in the process generates H2. The initial stage of the reaction proceeds via formal N&#8722;H oxidative addition at Al(I) (via a coordination/proton shuttling sequence) to give an aluminium(III) primary amido hydride. Subsequent protonolysis of the strongly hydridic Al&#8722;H bond selectively yields the corresponding aluminium bis(amide) and H2. This step occurs without competing protolytic ligand loss &#8211; exploiting the limited basicity of the supporting [(boryl)O]&#8722; donors. In terms of amide transfer reactivity, the utility of K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] in delivering one or both equivalents of [NH2]&#8722; to electrophilic substrates (HBpin, CO2 and Ph2CO) has been demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of an N-heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligated aluminyl compound has been harnessed for main-group-mediated dehydrogenative dual activation of ammonia. The Al(I) system K[{(HCDippN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al] reacts with excess NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to give the Al(III) bis(amide) K[{(HCDippN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and in the process generates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The initial stage of the reaction proceeds via formal N&#8722;H oxidative addition at Al(I) (via a coordination/proton shuttling sequence) to give an aluminium(III) primary amido hydride. Subsequent protonolysis of the strongly hydridic Al&#8722;H bond selectively yields the corresponding aluminium bis(amide) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This step occurs without competing protolytic ligand loss &#8211; exploiting the limited basicity of the supporting [(boryl)O]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; donors. In terms of amide transfer reactivity, the utility of K[{(HCDippN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in delivering one or both equivalents of [NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to electrophilic substrates (HBpin, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) has been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photogeneration and Visualization of a Surface&#8208;Stabilized Dinitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication we report the formation of a stable, surface&#8208;supported dinitrene achieved through the photolysis of a diazide precursor on an Au(111) metal substrate. We combine high&#8208;resolution scanning probe techniques with theoretical calculations, providing the first real&#8208;space imaging of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface and exploring the associated photoreaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nitrenes are known as key intermediates in various chemical reactions. Nitrene transfer reactions are particularly effective for synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, where metal catalysts play a crucial role in controlling nitrene reactivity and selectivity. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a stable surface&#8208;supported dinitrene on Au(111) through UV irradiation of its diazide precursor, characterized by scanning probe techniques. The photoreaction mechanism is elucidated with wavelength&#8208;dependent experiments and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. Our findings present the first real&#8208;space visualization of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface, highlighting its potential in catalysis and surface functionalization.

         <title>Promoting the Kinetics of Ethylene Electrosynthesis via the Facet&#8208;Dependent Activation of Acetylene over Silver Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;dependent acetylene activation phenomenon over silver (Ag) catalysts is discovered, and Ag (100) is selected as a suitable candidate to increase the hydrogenation kinetics to improve the activity of ethylene electrosynthesis through the electrocatalytic acetylene conversion process. In addition, the activation of acetylene (C2H2) is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of acetylene hydrogenation, guiding future catalyst design.







Abstract
Metallic silver (Ag) sites exhibit a robust ability to suppress undesired C&#8722;C coupling in the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) into ethylene (ESAE), leading to satisfactory selectivity and stability. However, the relatively low reaction kinetics still hinder its practical value. Here, the facet&#8208;dependent ESAE performance is first evaluated to increase the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics and provide mechanistic insight for subsequent catalyst design. As a result, the Ag nanocubes with {100} surfaces demonstrate a partial current density of 337&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, greatly outperforming their counterparts with {111} surfaces exposed. Further comparisons of H2O splitting and C2H2 hydrogenation reveal that the activation of C2H2 is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of ethylene electrosynthesis. Additionally, experimental and theoretical mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that stronger C2H2 adsorption over the {100} surface strengthens the &#960; conjugation of C2H2, leading to the delocalization of &#960; electrons to promote the activation of C2H2 for enhanced hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>Dynamic Ultralong Phosphorescence and Optical Waveguiding Switches in Silver&#8208;Organic Complex via Reversible Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal conversion and the heavy&#8208;atom effect, dynamically controllable ultralong phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable optical waveguide can be designed within an Ag&#8208;organic complex. This approach provides a straightforward way to expand room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence towards intelligent switches and Information storage.







Abstract
Dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have attracted considerable interest for applications in sensors, light&#8208;emitting devices, and information security. Here, we introduce a novel class of silver (Ag)&#8208;organic complexes exhibiting rare, direct ultralong RTP, achieved through the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Ag+ ions and highly ordered assembly of coordination polymers. The Ag&#8208;based complex displays reversible solvent&#8208;responsive RTP, shifting from green to yellow emission in response to humidity and solvent variations. This transformation is driven by a solvent&#8208;mediated single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) conversion, enabling color&#8208;tunable active optical waveguides and one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polarization switching. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for creating dynamically controllable ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic complexes and advances the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive 1D photonic systems for promising information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is promoted by an engineered variant of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA), giving rise to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent enantiopurity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
The enzyme 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) naturally catalyzes the reversible aldol addition between acetaldehyde and D&#8208;glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate to yield 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate. Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non&#8208;natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. This repurposed aldolase, named DERA&#8208;EP, is able to utilize H2O2 to accomplish both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA&#8208;EP in a substrate&#8208;free and substrate&#8208;bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented anti&#8208;selectivity of DERA&#8208;EP with multiple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the syn&#8208;selectivity of previously reported enzyme&#8208;, metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysts, making DERA&#8208;EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.

This repurposed aldolase, named DERA-EP, is able to utilize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to accomplish both &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-selective epoxidations of various &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA-EP in a substrate-free and substrate-bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme-bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity of DERA-EP with multiple &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity of previously reported enzyme-, metal- and organo-catalysts, making DERA-EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Robust Wetting Resistance for Durable Membrane Distillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising separation technique for producing pure water from brine using low&#8208;grade heat. Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with high porosity and well&#8208;ordered pore structure exhibit excellent flux and salt rejection during MD. However, long&#8208;term MD operation is often restricted by the inevitable gradual wetting of COF membranes which causes deterioration of salt rejection, primarily resulting from the lack of intrinsic hydrophobicity. Herein, a fluorinated COF membrane with intrinsic hydrophobicity and excellent anti&#8208;wetting property is reported. Under 65 &#176;C and 12 kPa absolute pressure, this membrane maintained a high water flux of 195 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and a salt rejection of 99.80% over 168 h of MD operation, which is the longest operation time ever reported for MD using COF membranes. In addition, the fluorinated COF membrane showed unparalleled resistance to scaling and organic fouling, demonstrating great potential for real&#8208;world brine treatment. Experimental and simulation studies revealed that incorporation of fluorine not only enhanced the hydrophobicity of the COF membrane, but also created electrostatic barriers within the fluorinated nanochannels, efficiently preventing ion penetration. These results underscore the remarkable potential of fluorinated COF membranes in MD, offering a promising solution for sustainable brine desalination.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling to Access Polysubstituted Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of cyclobutene remains inefficient due to inherent ring strain and poor regioselectivity. We demonstrate&#160;here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between readily accessible homopropargyl halides and commercially available aryl/vinyl electrophiles for the direct access to polysubstituted cyclobutenes. This approach provides the first reductive 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, which paves the way for synthesis of diverse cyclobutene containing compounds (including synthetically challenging macrocycles). The synthesis of antitumor&#8208;active Combretastatin A&#8208;4 analog has been significantly optimized, the original six&#8208;step procedure yielding 14% has been streamlined into a three&#8208;steps process that achieves a markedly improved yield of 51%. Experimental data and computational studies support a mechanism involving an alkenyl nickel(I) intermediate, which undergoes facile back&#8208;side SH2 attack to produce the strained cyclobutene ring with overall stereo&#8208;inversion at the homopropargylic position.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (Mn&#8208;based OIMHs) scintillators have aroused a research upsurge due to their outstanding photoluminescence performance, low toxicity, and tunable structures. Herein, we demonstrate a molecular engineering strategy that synergistically enhances luminescence efficiency and radiation sensitivity by systematic elongation of branched alkyl chains in phosphonium&#8208;based cations. The (4&#8208;DEATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DEATBP = (4&#8208;(diethylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) crystal exhibits remarkable thermochromic luminescence properties and anti&#8208;thermal quenching effect, highlighting the application potential in high&#8208;temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. Through effective chain elongation, the (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DBATBP = (4&#8208;(dibutylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) single crystal achieves an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100% and exhibits superior performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation, with a high light yield of 67953 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10.45 nGy s&#8722;1. Additionally, the glassy (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 25 lp mm&#8722;1. (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 shows great application potential in the fields of white light&#8208;emitting diode (WLED) and express security check due to its outstanding luminescence performance.

         <title>Heteroanionic Halogenated TiBTx MBene Protective Layer with Dual&#8208;Functional Zincophilic and Hydrophobic Characteristics for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hexagonal transition metal borides (h&#8208;MBenes), emerging members of 2D materials, demonstrate significant potential as protective layers for metal anodes. However, conventional MBenes synthesized by wet etching have massive oxygen&#8208;containing terminations imported during chemical synthesis process, with zincophobic and hydrophilic, resulting severe dendrite growth kinetics and compromising electrode performance. In this study, we report a novel hetero&#8208;halogen TiBTX (TX = Cl and I) h&#8208;MBenes through a halogen&#8208;radius&#8208;isomerization strategy, enabling precise mixed&#8208;halogen functionalization to create an ultrahigh zincophilic and hydrophobic microenvironment. Compared to single &#8208;I terminations, the mixed&#8208;halogen TiBTX exhibits significantly enhanced zincophilicity with ordered Zn2+ adsorption, attributed to the asymmetry&#8208;inductive effect of the larger&#8208;radius &#8208;I ions. Simultaneously, the &#8208;Cl moieties serve as a protective barrier, mitigating water&#8208;induced corrosion of the Zn anode in aqueous electrolytes. Notably, the dual&#8208;functional TiBTx&#8208;31 layer (TiBI0.32Cl0.13) demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a prolonged cycling life exceeding 2000 hours an impressive average coulombic efficiency of 99.86%. Furthermore, the TiBTx&#8208;31@Zn||NVO full pouch cell maintains 95.3% capacity retention over 100 cycles.

However, conventional MBenes synthesized by wet etching have massive oxygen-containing terminations imported during chemical synthesis process, with zincophobic and hydrophilic, resulting severe dendrite growth kinetics and compromising electrode performance. In this study, we report a novel hetero-halogen TiBTX (TX = Cl and I) h-MBenes through a halogen-radius-isomerization strategy, enabling precise mixed-halogen functionalization to create an ultrahigh zincophilic and hydrophobic microenvironment. Compared to single -I terminations, the mixed-halogen TiBTX exhibits significantly enhanced zincophilicity with ordered Zn2+ adsorption, attributed to the asymmetry-inductive effect of the larger-radius -I ions. Simultaneously, the -Cl moieties serve as a protective barrier, mitigating water-induced corrosion of the Zn anode in aqueous electrolytes. Notably, the dual-functional TiBTx-31 layer (TiBI0.32Cl0.13) demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a prolonged cycling life exceeding 2000 hours an impressive average coulombic efficiency of 99.86%. Furthermore, the TiBTx-31@Zn||NVO full pouch cell maintains 95.3% capacity retention over 100 cycles. This work highlights the innovative halogen-radius-isomerization approach for interfacial engineering by tailoring halogen terminations, offering new insights for the development of high-performance h-MBenes-based energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Lipid Nanosonosensitizers with Size Reduction and NO Release: Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains difficult to treat due to its dense extracellular matrix (ECM), immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and deep&#8208;seated anatomy. To address these challenges, we developed IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer that synergizes sonodynamic therapy (SDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for orthotopic PC. IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO undergoes three key US&#8208;activated responses: (1) size reduction, (2) controlled release of irinotecan (IR) and nitric oxide (NO), and (3) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under low&#8208;dose US, IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO reduces in size (from ~120 nm to ~40 nm), enhancing tumor penetration, and releases NO to remodel the TME by normalizing vasculature and degrading ECM. This enhances nanosonosensitizers accumulation and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) infiltration. High&#8208;dose US irradiation triggers the generation of cytotoxic ROS, which, in combination with IR&#8208;mediated chemotherapy, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and enhances antitumor immunity. Additionally, combining IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO with PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) immunotherapy significantly prolongs survival in orthotopic PC models. The cascade strategy&#8212;size reduction, TME remodeling, and multimodal therapy&#8212;effectively overcomes stromal and immunosuppressive barriers, offering a robust platform for treating deep&#8208;seated PC.</dc:description>

         <title>Azuperylene: The Non&#8208;Alternant Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isoelectronic isomer of perylene, hereafter called as azuperylene, has been prepared. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the new isomer can be described as a union of two antiparallel azulenes in which the azulene&#8208;type aromatic character of the starting azulene is partially retained. Four 2,8&#8208;dialkoxy (i.e. ethoxy, n&#8208;butoxy, n&#8208;hexyloxy, n&#8208;octyloxy) functionalized derivatives of the new isomer core have been prepared. The solid&#8208;state structures of the new compounds have been resolved showing exceptional herringbone &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking ideal for charge transport. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors on sublimated substrates display an excellent hole transport mobility up to 1.03 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 which largely surpasses that of perylene and reveals the great potential for charge transport of this new class of non&#8208;benzenoid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Monolithium Monohydrogen Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins and their metal complexes play essential roles in biological and industrial processes, functioning as key components in catalysis, photodynamic therapy, and organic (opto&#8208;)electronic materials. Despite their significance, the intermediate states involved in metal incorporation into porphyrins remain poorly understood and are rarely observed as stable compounds. Here, we report the solvent&#8208;free synthesis of the first neutral alkali metal monohydrogen porphyrin, which was selectively obtained by reaction of lithium vapor with thin films of tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The resulting monolithium monohydrogen tetraphenyl&#173;porphy&#173;rin (LiHTPP) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and can be sublimated under UHV at 485 K without disproportionation, enabling its isolation. LiHTPP reacts with additional lithium to form dilithium tetraphenylporphyrin (Li2TPP), as confirmed through product analysis and reaction monitoring via photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Complementary theoretical simulations provide deeper insight into the chemical structure of this non&#8208;planar complex and the energetics of its formation. This study advances the understanding of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins and their role in metalation pathways, introducing a novel synthetic route for stable intermediates. The study also underscores the potential of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins for developing catalysts and electronic materials with tunable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Supramolecular Language Processing for Co&#8208;crystal Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approximately 40% of marketed drugs exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles. Co&#8208;crystallization, where pairs of molecules form a multicomponent crystal, constitutes a promising strategy to enhance physicochemical properties without compromising pharmacological activity. However, finding promising co&#8208;crystal pairs is resource&#8208;intensive, due to the large and diverse range of possible molecular combinations. We present DeepCocrystal, a novel deep learning approach designed to predict co&#8208;crystal formation by processing the "chemical language" from a supramolecular vantage point. Rigorous validation of DeepCocrystal showed a balanced accuracy of 78% in realistic scenarios, outperforming existing models. Explainable AI approaches uncovered the decision&#8208;making process of DeepCocrystal, showing its capability to learn chemically relevant aspects of the "supramolecular language" that match experimental co&#8208;crystallization patterns. By leveraging properties of molecular string representations, DeepCocrystal can also estimate the uncertainty of its predictions. We harness this capability in a challenging prospective study and successfully discovered two novel co&#8208;crystals of diflunisal, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. This study underscores the potential of deep learning &#8212; and in particular of chemical language processing &#8212; to accelerate co&#8208;crystallization and ultimately drug development, in both academic and industrial contexts.&#160;DeepCocrystal is available as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use web application at https://deepcocrystal.streamlit.app/.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Proton&#8208;Feeding Retards the Deprotonation for Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite&#160;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have shown great potential in the application of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their large exciton binding energy, tunable bandgaps and solution processability. However, the heavily used spacer cations will cause serious deprotonation reactions in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, leading to lattice collapse and abundant defect states, which is notorious for fabricating efficient perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Herein, we develop an in situ proton&#8208;feeding strategy to restrain the deprotonation process in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites by introducing a proton&#8208;rich Lewis base, namely trifluoromethyl nicotinic acid (TFNA), into the perovskite precursor solutions. The TFNA molecules can donate protons during the growth of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films to simultaneously compensate the deprotonated spacer cations, passivate the defects states by coordinating with Pb2+ and improve structural stability by forming hydrogen bonds with organic spacers. This leads to an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 78.8%. The resulting red&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 27.5% at 660 nm, accompanied by a 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement of the operational lifetime (T50) compared to that of the reference device based on pristine perovskite. This work deepens the understanding of the crystallization of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films and provides a new avenue to improve the PeLEDs performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[8]arene&#8208;Tethered Dendritic Octamer Acceptor with Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Enables 20.7% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Exceptional Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the molecular weight of the acceptor is an effective strategy to suppress excessive crystallization and molecular diffusion, thereby addressing morphological challenges in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, designing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptor with well&#8208;defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs&#160;towards commercialization.

         <title>Divergent Construction of Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Pentacyclic Scaffolds via Double Dearomative Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutane&#8208;fused polycyclic scaffolds are structurally interesting cores in natural product synthesis and drug discovery. The construction of these skeletons often requires elaborate synthetic effort and gives low efficiency. We herein demonstrated the divergent construction of various cyclobutane&#8208;fused 2D/3D pentacyclic scaffolds by a photocatalytic intermolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes. These skeletons, typically unattainable under thermal conditions, could be accessed with exclusive diastereoselectivity under mild photochemical conditions. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4&#8208;hydroalkylation, alkene isomerization, and [2+2] cycloaddition via an intertwined single electron transfer (SET)/energy transfer (EnT) nature. This protocol provided a divergent synthetic approach for constructing (pseudo)&#8208;dimeric cyclobutane&#8208;fused 2D/3D pentacyclic scaffolds. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intermolecular double dearomative cycloaddition between naphthalenes and benzothiophenes was also realized, providing indispensable methods for unprecedented structurally diverse polycyclic molecules that were difficult to access by conventional transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Bicarbonate Electrolysis to Formate Enabled via Ionomer Surface Modification in Cation Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a promising method for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals, with formate being a particularly viable product. However, current gas&#8208;fed CO2RR systems rely on highly pure CO2 feed gases and are incompatible with point&#8208;source CO2 emissions without prior capture and concentration. Bicarbonate electrolysis offers a potential solution by bridging the gap between CO2 emissions and utilization. However, existing electrolyzer configurations, especially those using bipolar membranes (BPM), require high working voltages and suffer from poor energy efficiency. Here, we present a cation exchange membrane (CEM)&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) incorporating a surface&#8208;modified bismuth cathode catalyst. The success of this approach is attributed to two key factors: the use of the positively charged ionomer PiperION for surface modification, which creates a favorable cathode microenvironment; the single CEM that enhances proton flux from the anode to the cathode while reducing ionic impedance. The CEM&#8208;based MEA demonstrates a formate Faradaic efficiency of up to 80%, with a significant 1 V reduction in operating voltage compared to BPM&#8208;based MEAs at 300 mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, the CEM&#8208;based MEA exhibits excellent tolerance to O2 impurities and maintains high performance even with simulated flue gas, making it suitable for direct CO2 utilization from point&#8208;source.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Manganese Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) holds tremendous potential for remediating NO3&#8722; pollution in groundwater while enabling clean ammonia (NH3) production. However, most catalysts achieve high conversion efficiency relying on high NO3&#8722; concentrations. How to catalyze the NO3&#8722;RR with low concentration of NO3&#8722; is still a challenge due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To address this limitation, we constructed a novel asymmetric isolated Mn atom based on N&#8208;coordination covalent organic framework (COF) (ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn), for efficient NO3&#8722;RR at a low NO3&#8722; concentration of 2 mg mL&#8722;1. This bidentate&#8208;coordinated COF featured a robust and chemically stable framework, while the synergistic interaction between asymmetric imine N and pyridine N modified the charge distribution of Mn atoms to optimize catalytic efficiency. ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, with 95.64% NH3 selectivity and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 1927 mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1, exceeding the corresponding parameters of symmetric Mn sitesby factors of 1.27 and 1.41, respectively. In situ ATR&#8208;FTIR measurements and theoretical calculations revealed that the asymmetric isolated Mn facilitated a reduction in the energy barrier for *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH conversion, and thus contributed to higher activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe Confined into MnO Nanoclusters Enhances Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts are promising alternatives to expensive noble metals for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we present a simple metal&#8208;atom localization strategy to confine the atomically dispersed Fe into MnO nanoclusters, which are dispersed and immobilized on high&#8208;conductivity carbon support (MF/CN). The experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the trace Fe(III) ions doped into MnO nanoclusters can induce charge transfer and spin state transition to trigger a butterfly effect, obtaining abundant active Mn(III) with single&#8208;electron eg configuration and strengthened built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF), which is greatly helpful to balance the adsorption and desorption of ORR O&#8208;containing intermediates, facilitate the interfacial electron transfer, and improve the electrical conductivity. As a result, the optimized MF0.04/CN exhibits compelling alkaline ORR activity (half&#8208;wave potential 0.79 V vs RHE) and stability (nearly 100% current retention rate for 30 h). Finally, the MF0.04/CN realizes a remarkable power density (138 mW cm&#8208;2) and durability (&gt; 666 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) in Zn&#8208;air batteries. This finding not only helps to design high&#8208;performance metal oxide heterointerfaces by tuning eg orbital occupancy and BIEF strength, but also deepens the understanding of the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemistry&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Primary Alkyl&#8208;alkoxylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a primary alkylative difunctionalization of olefins based on the decarboxylation of carboxylate ions to obtain alkyl radicals by electrochemical anodic oxidation is reported. The reaction employs quaternary ammonium carboxylates as the source of alkyl radicals and does not require additional oxidizing agents or electrolytes. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate range and functional group compatibility. It gently converts mono&#8208; or disubstituted styrene substrates and alkyl carboxylate anions of various carbon chain lengths and substituents to products under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, it is important to note that not only alcohols but carboxylic acids and water can also serve as nucleophilic reagents to participate in the reaction and yield the corresponding products. Preliminary mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the reaction is enabled by the lower oxidation potential of the carboxylate anion compared to that of the olefin. The anodic oxidation of the carboxylate anion occurs prior to the oxidation of the olefin, followed by decarboxylation to obtain alkyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Design, Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Insight into Lysine Selection via Controlled Degradation of 2,4&#8208;Diaminobutyric Acid and Ornithine Polypeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selection of twenty canonical amino acids in protein synthesis is well&#8208;established, yet the reasons behind their natural selection remain unclear. Specifically, why structurally similar analogs, such as L&#8208;2,4&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (Dab) and L&#8208;ornithine (Orn), are not chosen over L&#8208;lysine (Lys) is unknown. These analogs differ only in alkyl chain length, raising the question of whether such variations influence polypeptide stability and natural selection. To investigate how unnatural amino acids affect the stability of synthesized polypeptides, we present the efficient synthesis of o&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate&#8208;caged photo&#8208;responsive polypeptide amphiphiles based on Dab and Orn via polymerization of N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized amino acid precursors. Depending on the self&#8208;assembly methods, these poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) formed various nanostructures, including two&#8208;dimensional discs and oblate vesicles. Upon photoirradiation, the newly liberated primary amines in the polypeptide side chains underwent spontaneous cyclization with backbone amide linkages to generate thermodynamically stable 5&#8208;membered or 6&#8208;membered lactams. Such a backbone degradation process eventually led to the disassembly and disintegration of the assemblies. These findings provide new insights into the natural selection of Lys over its analogs, Dab and Orn, in proteins, and open new possibilities for creating functional polypeptide&#8208;based materials in controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering, and other biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance FeP Catalyst for Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Recovery via Joule&#8208;Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO&#8323;RR) offers a promising route for decentralized and sustainable ammonia production while addressing environmental challenges associated with nitrate pollution. However, the development of practical implementations has been slowed by the challenge of creating highly stable and selective catalysts for strongly basic environments, along with the difficulty of efficiently recovering ammonia from dilute solutions. Here, we introduce a partially oxidized amorphous iron&#8208;phosphide (POA&#8208;FeP) electrocatalyst that combines high activity and stability with an innovative Joule&#8208;stripping strategy for ammonia recovery. Electrodeposited onto nickel foam (NF), the POA&#8208;FeP catalyst achieves benchmark partial current densities of &#8722;720mA cm&#8722;2 in neutral media and &#8722;932mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, and near quantitative Faradaic efficiencies (FE). The robustness of the POA&#8208;FeP/NF catalyst was highlighted by its ability to maintain FE above 90% during continuous operation for over 1000h at a total current density of &#8722;300mA cm&#8722;2. We demonstrate that the Joule heating resulting from the operation of the electrolyzer at high current density can be exploited to induce the volatilization of ammonia, which can then be recovered as solid ammonium chloride with &gt;95% yield. This integrated Joule&#8208;stripping approach simplifies ammonia recovery and opens up new possibilities for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient nitrate reduction systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Supramolecular Photosensitizers Derived from Conventional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs) offer advantages such as efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), low dark cytotoxicity, good photostability, and high biocompatibility. While the development of new PSs through organic synthesis has been a focus of active research, supramolecular chemistry offers a complementary pathway. This study presents a versatile supramolecular strategy to convert conventional fluorophores into heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs using a cyclic peptide&#8208;based scaffold that densely assembles fluorophore moieties. Results demonstrate that supramolecular PSs constructed from four synthetic fluorophore types&#8212;cyanines, coumarins, rhodamines, and BODIPYs&#8212;exhibit a remarkable enhancement in ROS generation efficiency, attributed to the increased intersystem crossing efficiency induced by self&#8208;assembly. Moreover, these supramolecular PSs function as visible&#8208;light photocatalysts, efficiently regenerating NAD+ from NADH. The densely packed polymer shell further shields enzymes from ROS&#8208;induced deactivation, thereby facilitating the development of robust photo&#8208;enzyme catalytic systems. This study not only enriches the design methodology of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs, but also paves the way for eco&#8208;friendly photo&#8208;biocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting the Intermediates Hydrogenation for Urea Electrosynthesis over an &#8220;Active Hydrogen Pump&#8221; Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic coupling of CO2 and NO3&#8722; offers a sustainable approach for urea production. However, the limited supply of active hydrogen (*H) hinders the formation of the key carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates, thus impeding the selective C&#8210;N coupling. Herein, we developed copper molybdate (Cu3Mo2O9) nanorods, which could serve as &#8220;active hydrogen pump&#8221; catalysts by regulating the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption. Such electrocatalyst would guarantee a steady *H supply for intermediates hydrogenation, hence boosting the generation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates for selective C&#8210;N coupling and urea production. In a CO2&#8208;saturated 0.1 M KNO3 solution, Cu3Mo2O9 achieved a maximum urea yield rate of 177 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with a urea&#8208;producing FE of 40% in a flow cell configuration, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. This study underscores the crucial role of *H, which may guide the exploration of advanced catalysts for expediting the sustainable synthesis of indispensable chemicals requiring rapid intermediates hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heterodimeric Cluster&#8208;based Pair Catalyst for Electrochemical Synthesis of Cyclohexanone Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous catalysts are complex chemical ecosystems, where various functional units execute their individual responsibilities to together complete a catalysis ensemble. Here we report a dinuclear catalyst originated from two molecular&#8208;purity monomers including an atomically precise Ag4Pd2(SR)8 cluster and a polyoxotitanium Ti4O2(TBC[4])2(iPrO)4 cluster that are eventually paired off by the bridging sulfur. The heterodimeric catalyst with a unique interface consisted of the Ti&#8208;S&#8208;metal (metal = Pd and Ag) motifs exhibits selective recognition for nitrogen sources, thereby achieving high performances for the electrochemical synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime. The nitrate is favourably deoxygenated on the metal sites to generate nitrite, followed by the flipping of nitrite at the Ti&#8208;S&#8208;metal interface and the stepwise reduction of nitrite on the Ti site to produce hydroxylamine. Sequentially a spontaneous coupling from hydroxylamine and cyclohexanone proceeds to construct the C=N bond for cyclohexanone oxime. Using this combination of distinct functional modules into one catalyst, we develop a strategy for heterogeneous catalysts being designed to increase the substrate conversion while simultaneously increasing the target product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Dynamic Covalent Knoevenagel/Hydrazide Condensation for Polyacylhydrazones and Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid advancement of dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) has significantly impacted both chemistry and materials science. There is an increasing need for exploring catalyst&#8208;free dynamic covalent reactions with large equilibrium constant (Keq) ranges to provide new avenues for the tailored design of dynamic polymers. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free dynamic covalent condensation reaction between Knoevenagel derivatives and hydrazides to generate acylhydrazones. Systematic small&#8208;molecule studies validate a significant substituent effect on the Kn reactant, resulting in a wide Keq range covering nearly four orders of magnitude (0.1 ~ 719). The high Keq values (&gt; 500) achieved in polar aprotic solvents enable the catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass (~ 180 kDa) polyacylhydrazones. The retention of by&#8208;products during polycondensation leads to concentration&#8208;dependent topology switching between polymeric and macrocyclic acylhydrazones. By leveraging this reaction, we developed a novel covalent adaptable network (CAN) that exhibits remarkable stress relaxation properties (38 s at 160 &#176;C), facilitating efficient thermal reprocessing while maintaining high mechanical performance. This condensation reaction enriches the dynamic covalent toolbox and offers a versatile approach for the design and fabrication of dynamic polymers with tailored mechanical and dynamic behavior.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The rapid advancement of dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) has significantly impacted both chemistry and materials science. There is an increasing need for exploring catalyst-free dynamic covalent reactions with large equilibrium constant (Keq) ranges to provide new avenues for the tailored design of dynamic polymers. Here, we report a catalyst-free dynamic covalent condensation reaction between Knoevenagel derivatives and hydrazides to generate acylhydrazones. Systematic small-molecule studies validate a significant substituent effect on the Kn reactant, resulting in a wide Keq range covering nearly four orders of magnitude (0.1 ~ 719). The high Keq values (&amp;gt; 500) achieved in polar aprotic solvents enable the catalyst-free synthesis of high-molar-mass (~ 180 kDa) polyacylhydrazones. The retention of by-products during polycondensation leads to concentration-dependent topology switching between polymeric and macrocyclic acylhydrazones. By leveraging this reaction, we developed a novel covalent adaptable network (CAN) that exhibits remarkable stress relaxation properties (38 s at 160 &#176;C), facilitating efficient thermal reprocessing while maintaining high mechanical performance.

         <title>Uniform Half&#8208;substituted Chiral Arylcycloparaphenylene: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategic implementation of aryl&#8208;functionalization in every phenyl group in organic architectures presents a transformative approach to constructing novel molecular nanocarbon materials. In this present work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a uniform and chiral half&#8208;aryl substituted cycloparaphenylene (CPP), [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirms its hoop&#8208;shaped structure and the existence of planar chirality arising from stereochemically distinct substituent orientations. The resolved pS and pR enantiomers display mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism (CD) signals and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum| = 2.6 &#215; 10&#8722;2). Photophysical characterization reveals the emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, with pure [6]CPP&#8208;12tBuPh powder sample exhibiting intense orange fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Driven Site&#8208;Selective Activation of &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H in Alcohols: A Straightforward Dual&#8208;Catalysis Strategy for Efficient Acceptorless&#160;Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation of alcohols into corresponding carbonyl derivatives is of paramount importance for the construction of complex molecules. Current strategies for catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols were predominantly confined to reactive alcohols, such as benzyl or allyl alcohols, due to the relatively high &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bond dissociation energy of the conventional unreactive alcohols. Notably, weak bond catalysis, particularly hydrogen bonding, can selectively activate C&#8208;H bonds by modulating the distribution of electron density. Herein, we have developed a dual&#8208;catalysis platform that enabled highly efficient oxidation of alcohols promoted by a multifunctional catalyst. This strategy achieves selective activation of the hydroxyl &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bond via hydrogen bonding interactions and polarity matching, which is compatible with both primary and secondary alcohols, demonstrating potential applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. Moreover, DFT studies provide compelling evidence that hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions between 3&#8208;quinuclidinone and alcohols play a pivotal role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the total synthesis of malabaricane triterpene sodagnitin E, marking the first synthesis of any malabaricane natural product to date. The enantioselective synthesis of two key fragments, followed by their coupling&#160;via&#160;a Mukaiyama aldol reaction delivered the triterpene framework in a convergent synthesis. A thorough analysis of the synthetic material led to the elucidation of a previously unassigned stereocenter (C17) as well as the reassignment of the configuration at C27. This enabled the structural revision of the relative configuration at the central lactol moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of Molecular Conformation of the Passivating Agents for High&#8208;performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular structure engineering of passivating agents has proven to be a pivotal strategy for developing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). While previous studies have focused on molecular configuration design, the influence of molecular conformations on device performance remains largely unexplored. Herein, we systematically investigate this critical factor by developing a series of diammonium iodide passivators with tunable conformational rigidity through aryl or alkyl group modifications. Notably, PSC performance exhibits a consistent enhancement with increasing rotational flexibility of the ammonium groups. Detailed carrier dynamics analysis reveals a direct correlation between molecular conformational freedom and defect passivation effectiveness. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that both static geometric matching and dynamic conformation adaptability to perovskite lattice defects govern the passivation quality. The optimized passivator with maximum conformational flexibility enables PSCs to achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.6% (certified stabilized efficiency: 26.4%). This study establishes molecular conformation engineering as a crucial dimension in defect passivation strategies and provides fundamental insights for advancing perovskite photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Switching Oxygen Reduction Reaction Driven by Dual&#8208;crystalline Bimetallic MOF induces Self&#8208;Potential&#8208;Resolved Electrochemiluminescence biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Framework materials, particularly metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have emerged as versatile platforms for multifunctional applications due to their tunable structures and properties. In this study, a series of bimetallic ZnRuMOFs with dual&#8208;crystalline phase structure was designed and synthesized. This unique dual&#8208;crystalline bimetallic MOF configuration enables intramolecular autocatalysis and selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By utilizing endogenous dissolved O2 as a green co&#8208;reactant, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)&#8208;coupled ORR system with potential&#8208;resolving capability was developed. Experimental results, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, elucidated the ability of MOFs with different phase structures to catalyze specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the mechanism of ECL luminescence mediated by intramolecular autocatalysis using ZnRuMOF as the luminophor. The selectively generated ROS function as intramolecular coreactants, reducing radical transfer losses and significantly enhancing ECL stability. Leveraging these findings, a novel potentiometrically resolved ECL biosensor for the cardiovascular disease biomarker microRNA 24 was constructed. The biosensor integrates ROS&#8208;mediated intramolecular modulation with a platinum single&#8208;atom catalysts (Pt&#8208;N&#8208;SAC). This study demonstrates that precise modulation of MOF structures reveals distinct catalytic properties associated with different MOF configurations, offering a new strategy for the development of simple yet efficient monoluminescent ECL systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Diradical&#8208;Derived Conjugated Radical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated radical polymers (RPs) with polyradical structures in an &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymeric backbone have the potential to serve as both model molecules for spin&#8208;correlated condensed matters and as materials for optoelectronics and spin&#8208;based quantum applications. However, preparing RPs of this type with high stability and spin&#8208;delocalized nature presents a significant challenge. We report herein two ambient&#8208;stable conjugated RPs (RPH and RPC), synthetically obtained by an unprecedented straightforward copolymerization of two brominated diradical monomers (diradical characters up to 0.88) with bis&#8208;stannalyted DPP units. Compared to diradical monomers with a singlet open&#8208;shell ground state, the diradical&#8208;derived RPs gave rise to favorable spin&#8208;delocalization of conjugated polyradicals over macromolecular chain with ground states of S = 1/2, accompanied by featured electronic properties including intense near&#8208;infrared absorptions beyond 1000 nm, multi&#8208;stage amphoteric redox characteristics, and intriguing &#960;&#8208;paramagnetism in solution and solid states. Impressively, thin&#8208;film state RPH exhibited superior ambipolar carrier&#8208;transporting properties with well&#8208;balanced hole/electron mobility of up to 0.41/0.38 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 as well as attractive room&#8208;temperature quantum coherence times (T1 = 1.88 &#956;s, T2 = 218 ns), reflecting practical significance for quantum information manipulations. This study introduces a facile approach for constructing stable conjugated RPs, along with their integrated electronic and spin properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Diazatriptycene Exhibiting Acid&#8208;Induced Ternary Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching and Crystal Morphology Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doubly N&#8208;doped triptycene 2,6&#8208;diazatriptycene 1 was synthesized as the first example of triptycene&#8208;bearing intrinsic chirality in its core. The resolved enantiomers exhibited an acid&#8208;induced ternary circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switching behavior, enabling on/off and +/&#8211; control, with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of approximately 10&#8211;3. Density functional theory calculations indicated that these ternary CPL changes were derived from modulation of through&#8208;space conjugation within the triptycene skeleton. In addition, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 and the salt 1&#8226;(TfOH)n revealed the presence of herringbone arrangements, trimer clusters, chiral porous tubes, and 2D charge&#8208;segregated array structures. These results demonstrate that precise change of the molecular assembly can be achieved using N&#8208;doped chiral triptycene facilitated by ionic hydrogen bonding and donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels is pivotal for establishing sustainable energy systems, yet persistent challenges in carrier dynamics and reaction selectivity hinder practical implementation. This review systematically examines the emerging paradigm of &#8221;electricity&#8221;assisted solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel catalysis, innovatively proposing a dual&#8208;path framework based on distinct electrical intervention mechanisms: Cross&#8208;Space Charge Transfer System and Local Electric Field Regulation System, elucidating their unique roles in bridging light absorption and fuel synthesis. In the cross space charge transfer system, charge transfer driven by external bias enhances separation of photogenerated charges in single photoelectrode photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), while the self&#8208;powered dual photoelectrodes PEC&#8208;PEC, photovoltaic&#8208;photoelectrocatalysis (PV&#8208;PEC), and photovoltaic&#8208;electrocatalysis (PV&#8208;EC) systems achieve zero energy conversion from solar energy to fuel through band matching and device integration, utilizing charge transfer driven by photogenerated potential. In the local electric field regulation system, static intrinsic electric field (spontaneous polarization and interface electric field) and dynamic electric field (piezoelectric, pyroelectric, flexoelectric and triboelectric induced transient electric field) optimize carrier transport dynamics and accelerate reactant adsorption. This article systematically summarizes promotion of diverse forms of&#8220;electricity&#8221;on solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel catalysis, reveals energy conversion mechanisms, material design principles, performance bottlenecks, and solutions of different systems, providing insights into the future development direction of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Intrinsically Stable Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Introducing Fused&#8208;Ring Intramolecular Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a novel SAM molecular design strategy by introducing fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions. The designed molecule, JJ32, features a benzo[5,6][1,4]thiazino[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline skeleton, where strong D&#8211;A interactions enhance charge delocalization and downshift the LUMO energy level. This leads to enhanced photostability, redox stability, and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, the improved redox stability benefits the promising polyoxometalate/SAM composite HSL, allowing the JJ32/HPWO&#8208;based OSC to reach 19.85% efficiency with improved stability.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) incorporating electron&#8208;donating conjugated units as head groups have witnessed remarkable success in helping achieve high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these molecules frequently exhibit a shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, rendering them prone to photodegradation.&#160;To tackle this problem, we introduce fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions into the design of SAM molecules to downshift the LUMO level. The resultant molecule, JJ32, shows both enhanced photostability and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the fused&#8208;ring intramolecular D&#8211;A interactions also help stabilize the radical cation state of JJ32 to result in significantly improved redox stability. This enables them to be included in polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based composite hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs), resulting in an impressive efficiency of 19.85% alongside significantly enhanced stability in corresponding OSCs. This study not only validates the concept of using fused&#8208;ring D&#8211;A&#8208;structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Desolventization and Lithium&#8208;Rich Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with lithiophilic sites and hydrogen bond interaction with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) can accelerate the desolvation process of lithium ion and guide the rapid and uniform deposition of Li+.








Abstract
Effectively managing Li+ migration behaviors and addressing the issues of side reactions at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface is crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work introduces a two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding and lithiophilic sites for the first time to tailor the electronic structure and solvation chemistry in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) based electrolyte and stabilize the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) interface. Initially, the abundant lithiophilic sites (C&#9552;O, C&#9552;N) in the HOF coordinate with Li+, acting as key electron donors to optimize the electronic structure while also reducing the desolvation energy barrier when Li+ dissociates from the solvent sheath. Moreover, the multifunctional hydrogen bonding not only acts as the &#8220;appended manipulator&#8221; to anchor &#8208;NH2 to LiTFSI and reduces the adverse reactions at the LMAs interface but also mitigates the mechanical stress during lithium deposition. As evidenced by various in/ex situ characterizations, the HOF&#8208;modified lithium&#8208;metal symmetric batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycling performance (11&#160;000&#160;h) and low voltage fluctuations at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This unique strategy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded synergistic lithiophilic sites provides a new perspective on the design of artificial interfacial layers for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>A Biodegradable Radical Polymer Enables High&#8208;Performance, Physically Transient Organic Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable radical polymer with intrinsic memristivity and on&#8208;demand physical transience is presented. We leverage the nonconjugated nature of the radical polymer for a systematic molecular engineering. The polymer enabled a high&#8208;performance organic memristive device comparable to inorganic transient memory devices, now equipped with additional functionalities including optical transparency, flexibility, biocompatibility, and the transience.








Abstract
Electronic devices often demand high reliability and longevity, but they also contribute significantly to electronic waste. Physically transient electronics have thus emerged as a promising alternative in future electronics, particularly in wearable and implantable bioelectronics. In these applications, memristive materials have gained significant attention for their potential to realize neuromorphic systems that offer energy&#8208;efficient, hardware&#8208;based parallel processing. By integrating memristive capabilities with transient behavior, this study bridges these two cutting&#8208;edge fields, creating materials that not only enable advanced computing but also dissociate sustainably. Additionally, we leverage the unique features of soft materials for their tunability, biocompatibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, which collectively enhance this integration. In this work, we first illustrate molecular engineering strategy on a radical polymer. We then proceed to two&#8208;terminal devices therefrom, which exhibit exceptional memory performance of &gt;106 on/off ratio, &gt;104 s state retention, and stability over 250 DC sweep cycles. A flexible, optically transparent, and physically transient crossbar arrays are also developed, which maintain the performance through &gt;3,000 bending cycles and fully dissociate in water at room temperature. This work represents an advancement toward a biorealistic platform with substantial multifunctionality, making it readily translatable to future wearable and implantable neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Regulating Ion Transport Through Direct Coordination in Composite Gel Polymer Electrolytes Toward High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Loading Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes. The composite gel polymer electrolyte facilitates high&#8208;performance Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cell. 








Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt;4.0&#160;V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. What's more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium&#8208;ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes and dendrite&#8208;free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum&#8208;based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Specially, cells with 8.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Generation via Peroxide&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages of peroxide redox chemistry are explored for green hydrogen production. Peroxide redox electrocatalysts enable efficient and selective peroxide production and oxidation, facilitating on&#8208;site hydrogen generation while achieving a nearly 50% reduction in applied potential compared to conventional water&#8208;splitting methods. An integrated bipolar&#8208;ion gradient system further reduces energy requirements to nearly one&#8208;third of traditional electrolysis.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) production through water electrolysis is a promising route for sustainable energy storage. However, conventional water electrolysis faces several challenges, such as large thermodynamic potential gaps and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics, which lead to high electricity consumption and limitations in H2 storage and transportation. A promising approach to overcoming these hurdles is hybrid water electrolysis, which integrates alternative, thermodynamically favorable reactions at the anode to enhance efficiency. In this study, we explore how peroxide redox electrocatalysis can address critical barriers in sustainable H2 production, storage, and transport. By leveraging a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient peroxide redox electrocatalyst, we demonstrate various electrolysis configurations that significantly reduce the required cell voltage&#8212;from the standard 1.23&#160;V down to &#8722;0.06&#160;V, highlighting its potential for scalable and economically viable electrolysis methodologies for H2 production.

         <title>Chiral Spirobipyridine Synthesis by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition between bisalkynyl malononitriles and terminal alkynes. Chiral spirobipyridines bearing ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituents can be synthesized with the help of chiral bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.








Abstract
Chiral spirobiindanes are recognized as the privileged structures in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the structurally similar chiral spirobipyridines have not yet been explored as chiral ligands or organocatalysts due to the absence of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of spirobipyridines via double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction. Spirobipyridines with ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents could be obtained with exclusive regioselectivity and up to 99% ee in the presence of cobalt and bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Spirobipyridines coordinate with transition metals as chiral ligands. Spirobipyridine dioxides can be applied as chiral organocatalysts in the asymmetric allylation of aldehydes.

         <title>Constructing Ionic Transport Network via Supramolecular Composite Binder in Cathode for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective composite binder strategy is proposed to establish multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels within the LiFePO4 cathode, which significantly improves the Li+ transport efficiency and achieves high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high cathode active loading.








Abstract
Binders play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of electrodes. However, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride binder with low ionic conductivity could not meet the ionic transport requirements of the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a composite binder (PPCL) derived from the cross&#8208;linking of linear molecules and mechanically interlocked molecules with typical supramolecular channel structure is designed. The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8722;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li+ transport channels to achieve stable Li+ transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.

         <title>Valence Tautomerism and Alkaline Properties of Global Aromatic Imine&#8208; and Methine&#8208;Bridged all&#8208;Benzenoid Macrocyclic Superpyrazine and Supertriazine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared two imine macrocycles, SPAZ and STAZ, as analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. SPAZ and STAZ exhibit Br&#248;nsted basicity with pKa values of 0.97 and 3.27, respectively. Notably, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, facilitated by aza[30]annulene pathways.








Abstract
The comprehensive understanding of the ground&#8208;state electronic structures of all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles and their charged species, particularly those exhibiting global (anti)aromaticity, remains poorly resolved. Here, we present two imine&#8208; and methine&#8208;bridged all&#8208;benzenoid [6]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenes SPAZ (superpyrazine) and STAZ (supertriazine)&#8208;designed as &#960;&#8208;extended analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. For the first time, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; alternating benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, mediated by a 30&#960; azaannulene conjugated pathway. The aromatic stabilization energy of global aromatic delocalization would partially counterbalance the energy penalty for disrupting three benzenoid sextets. Further protonation studies demonstrate their alkaline characteristics (pKa&#160;=&#160;0.97 for SPAZ; 3.27 for STAZ), with diprotonated SPAZ&#8208;DH and monoprotonated STAZ&#8208;MH adopting planarized geometries that amplify global aromaticity through charge&#8208;induced structural constraints and enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. Notably, two&#8208;electron reduction generates a dianion SPAZ&#8208;DA exhibiting 32&#960; electron global antiaromaticity with amine N atom embedded aza[30]annulene pathway. These findings establish a framework for decoding electronic structure property relationships in all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles, offering insights into aromaticity modulated regulations through tautomerism, protonation, and redox switching.

&lt;p&gt;We prepared two imine macrocycles, &lt;b&gt;SPAZ&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;STAZ&lt;/b&gt;, as analogues of 1,4-pyrazine and 1,3,5-triazine, respectively. &lt;b&gt;SPAZ&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;STAZ&lt;/b&gt; exhibit Br&#248;nsted basicity with p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.97 and 3.27, respectively. Notably, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super-Kekul&#233;&#8221; benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super-sextet&#8221; transient structure, facilitated by aza[30]annulene pathways.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive understanding of the ground-state electronic structures of all-benzenoid macrocycles and their charged species, particularly those exhibiting global (anti)aromaticity, remains poorly resolved. Here, we present two imine- and methine-bridged all-benzenoid [6]cyclo-&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenes &lt;b&gt;SPAZ&lt;/b&gt; (superpyrazine) and &lt;b&gt;STAZ&lt;/b&gt; (supertriazine)-designed as &#960;-extended analogues of 1,4-pyrazine and 1,3,5-triazine, respectively. For the first time, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super-Kekul&#233;&#8221; alternating benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super-sextet&#8221; transient structure, mediated by a 30&#960; azaannulene conjugated pathway. The aromatic stabilization energy of global aromatic delocalization would partially counterbalance the energy penalty for disrupting three benzenoid sextets. Further protonation studies demonstrate their alkaline characteristics (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.97 for &lt;b&gt;SPAZ&lt;/b&gt;; 3.27 for &lt;b&gt;STAZ&lt;/b&gt;), with diprotonated &lt;b&gt;SPAZ-DH&lt;/b&gt; and monoprotonated &lt;b&gt;STAZ-MH&lt;/b&gt; adopting planarized geometries that amplify global aromaticity through charge-induced structural constraints and enhanced &#960;-electron delocalization. Notably, two-electron reduction generates a dianion &lt;b&gt;SPAZ-DA&lt;/b&gt; exhibiting 32&#960; electron global antiaromaticity with amine N atom embedded aza[30]annulene pathway. These findings establish a framework for decoding electronic structure property relationships in all-benzenoid macrocycles, offering insights into aromaticity modulated regulations through tautomerism, protonation, and redox switching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanosensitive Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Visualizing Temporal Changes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanosensitive conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) with integrated twistable bonds enable real&#8208;time imaging of membrane tension in lipid bilayers. Using fluorescence lifetime analysis, COE&#8208;BY probes reveal vesicle rigidity changes during endocytosis, providing insights into membrane mechanics at the subcellular level.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;spanning molecules that serve as fluorescent dyes for bioimaging. However, COE emission has thus far only been capable of visualizing dye location and their preferential accumulation in different membrane&#8208;bound intracellular compartments. Herein, we report the first example of environmentally sensitive COEs for visualizing temporal changes in live cells, providing information on the physical properties of intracellular lipid bilayer membranes. The new COE&#8208;BY series is designed around a BODIPY central unit with a membrane&#8208;spanning topology and six cationic pendant groups ensuring solubility in aqueous media. These reporters feature high two&#8208;photon absorption cross section, NIR&#8208;II excitation capabilities under multiphoton excitation, and high dye brightness; all highly desirable photophysical features for bioimaging. The emission lifetime of the probes was sensitive to changes to both the lipid composition of model vesicle systems and membrane tension within cells, induced by either mechanical or osmotic stress. Using two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it is possible to use the most efficient emitter, namely, COE&#8208;BYPhOC4, to image changes in the mechanical properties of intracellular membranes. We show that these COEs remain stably vesicle&#8208;bound within the endolysosomal pathway over extended periods, allowing for long&#8208;term monitoring of the associated biophysical changes of these vesicles over time.

         <title>Introducing Photochemical Action Plots as a Tool for Unlocking On&#8211;Off Switchable Behavior in a Polymeric Eosin Y Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8211;Kowollik team provides a powerful tool for the investigation of the wavelength dependence of light&#8208;driven reactions. Herein, the methodology is applied to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots.

Abstract
Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for investigating the wavelength&#8208;dependent efficiency of photochemical processes. Herein, we apply the photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8211;Kowollik team to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots, paving the way for future in&#8208;depth explorations of the wavelength dependence of similar reactions. Specifically, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the catalytic oxidation capabilities of an Eosin Y functionalized polymer photocatalyst (P1) as well as a small molecule representative of the polymer bound Eosin Y moieties (EY) for the oxidation of triphenylphosphine. Introduction of zinc(II) ions into the system proved to drastically influence the optical absorption properties of both catalysts, accompanied by a pronounced influence on their wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity profiles which is not predictable based on the absorption spectra. For P1, these changes can be reversed by metal&#8208;mediated single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) formation upon base addition, giving access to a stimuli&#8208;responsive polymeric photocatalyst. Detailed analysis of the photocatalytic action plots enabled the identification of a suitable wavelength for the realization of an on&#8208;off switchable polymeric photocatalytic system.

         <title>Intrinsically Luminescent Nematic Liquid Crystals Enabling High&#8208;Brightness Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Chiral Coassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of luminescent nematic liquid crystals (N&#8208;LCs) exhibiting full&#8208;color emission was developed. Through coassembly with chiral dopants, these N&#8208;LCs enabled the fabrication of high&#8208;brightness full&#8208;color and white circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) films with simultaneously enhanced glum (up to 0.75) and photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 71%), representing the best performance to date among all intrinsically luminescent CPL materials.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with simultaneous high dissymmetry factor (glum) and brightness are pivotal for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs betwwen glum value and photoluminescenc quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we report a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct intrinsically luminescent chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films via coassembly of luminescent liquid crystals (LLCs) and chiral dopant. First, five intrinsic LLCs molecules (2PFQ, 2PFBQ, 2PFB, 2PFSe, and 2PFS) were synthesized by combining the biphenyl framework with dioctyl&#8208;functionalized fluorene, achieving exceptional nematic phases and high brightness with PLQY up to 99%. Then, chiral coassembly of the obtained LLCs with chiral dopants (P/M&#8208;THH) followed by rapid thermal quenching yielded Bragg reflection&#8208;free N*&#8208;LC films exhibiting high&#8208;brightness CPL with recorded glum values (up to 0.75) and PLQY (up to 71%). Full&#8208;color tunability and white CPL (CIE: 0.33, 0.33) were realized through precise compositional control. The simultaneous optimization of glum and PLQY enables high&#8208;brightness CPL with advanced anticounterfeiting capabilities, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;brighness CPL materials for polarized photonic and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Ligate and Release Strategy Based on Photoclick Reaction in Tandem with Pd&#8208;Mediated Deallylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consecutive, controllable, and revertible new&#8208;to&#8208;nature ligation and cleavage strategy has been rationally devised to selectively visualize and manipulate biomolecules of interest. The photoclick cycloaddition between allenyl phenyl ether motifs and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone analogues installed a terminal allyl handle at the exocyclic site, thereby enabling on&#8208;demand Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation to release phenolic payloads (copyright permission obtained from BioRender).








Abstract
The development of chemoselective tools that can conjugate, modify, and decouple chemical groups from biomacromolecules has enabled the study of biological processes at increasing levels of fidelity. Until recently, these tools can either couple chemical entities to biomacromolecules or decouple them, but not both. A method that can perform these functions in distinct steps on demand would be highly useful. To that end, we devised a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature strategy by bringing together and modifying two biocompatible transformations. In this new strategy, ligation is accomplished via the photoclick reaction between an allenyl motif with 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone which installs an allyl group at the site of conjugation. This allyl group can then be selectively utilized as a handle for phenolic release via Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated its utility in the selective labeling and delabeling of model protein scaffolds and cellular matrix. This multifunctional method paves the way for a controllable &#8220;ligate and release&#8221; strategy that enables on&#8208;demand visualization of biological entities but with an in built release mechanism to restore their original state.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerism in Electrolytes for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>

Description: The reversibility of the Zn anode is dramatically improved by dynamic modulation of the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl electrolyte additives for suppressing the adverse reactions in this work.








Abstract
The reversibility of zinc (Zn) anode is subject to adverse reactions. Herein we design a dynamic modulation strategy via enol&#8208;keto tautomerism to inhibit the side reactions, thus improving the reversibility of the Zn anode. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results demonstrate the keto form of additives can be adsorbed on the Zn anode, inhibiting dendrite growth, while the enol form can serve as a bidentate ligand to participate in the construction of solvation sheath for Zn2+, enhancing the kinetics of Zn2+ transport, simultaneously suppressing water activity and reducing HER and corrosion. Consequently, the Zn anode&#160;with optimal electrolyte additive achieves high reversibility, where Zn||Zn symmetric cells operate over 4000 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells have a life for 930 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Further, this dynamic modulation enables Zn||V2O5 full cells to work over 5000 cycles with a capacity retention of 83% at 5 A g&#8722;1, and the Zn||Br2 pouch cells deliver a high capacity of &#8764;180 mAh. This study offers an original perspective on the dynamic regulation of electrolytes for Zn anode.

         <title>Photodriven Aquatic Locomotion in Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Composites with Tunable Wettability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;functionalized MXene integrated into liquid crystal elastomers enables uniform dispersion, enhanced photothermal response, and tunable wettability through superwettable coatings. These properties facilitate light&#8208;induced actuation for advanced soft robotics both at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater.








Abstract
Photodriven liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) composites with thiol&#8208;functionalized Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx MXene nanosheets are introduced as a versatile material system for achieving controlled aquatic locomotion. By incorporating superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic coatings, these composites demonstrate distinct modalities at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the LCE nanocomposites is enhanced through the homogeneous dispersion of MXene platelets within the LCE matrix, facilitated by thiol&#8208;functionalization. Superhydrophobic coatings increase buoyancy and reduce drag, enabling locomotion akin to water striders at the air&#8211;water interface. Conversely, superhydrophilic coatings submerse the composites to allow photomechanical actuation to drive underwater locomotion against gravity. By combining tunable wettability with robust photothermal performance, these MXene&#8208;LCE composites open new opportunities for designing and integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in aquatic actuation systems.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Organic Semiconductor Thin Films Realized via Thermal Precursor Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;directed supramolecular semiconductor thin films are realized by a thermal precursor approach. The precursor film is formed via solution processes and thermally converted to the target semiconductor film. This versatile strategy enables the fabrication of supramolecularly controlled thin films composed of insoluble molecules like &#960;&#8208;extended molecules with multiple hydrogen bonding sites.








Abstract
Flexible organic semiconductors are regarded as an important class of functional materials, enabling their fabrication via a solution&#8208;processed method. However, supramolecularly designed organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) devices using hydrogen bonds have not been sufficiently developed. This is because of the reduced solubility caused by introducing hydrogen bond sites and the difficulty in controlling molecular orientations and packing structures. Herein, we report a reasonable strategy for the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded semiconductor thin films of a tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with amide groups using the thermal precursor approach. The thin films are successfully fabricated by thermal conversion of the corresponding precursor in the film state. Assembly structure with a hydrogen&#8208;bond network is revealed by the combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared p&#8208;polarized multiple&#8208;angle incidence resolution spectrometry. The OTFT devices exhibit high hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 among hydrogen&#8208;bonded OTFTs reported previously. Notably, we unveiled the high thermal stability of semiconductor films without decreasing device performance in air up to 250&#160;&#176;C. This strategy can become a key methodology to form hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed organic electronic devices, namely supramolecular devices.

High defective Fe2O3 nanoparticles on Cu synthesis by plasma introduced multifunctional oxygen vacancies achieving 100% NH3 selectivity through a plasma&#8208;electrochemical system capable of directly reducing air to gaseous NH3.








Abstract
Current ammonia (NH&#8323;) synthesis is hindered by challenges including N&#8322; activation, NH&#8323; separation and process complexity. Here, we report a plasma&#8208;electrochemical process for the production of gaseous ammonia from air generated NOx, decoupled from processes employing liquid phase intermediaries such as NO&#8323;&#8315; and final product (NH4+). Importantly, this process uses air for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions and directly produces gaseous NH&#8323; which facilitates efficient product separation. For NOx reduction to NH&#8323;, we propose a universal strategy combining plasma pretreatment and wet chemical calcination to introduce multifunctional oxygen vacancies. The resulting highly defective Fe&#8322;O&#8323; nanoparticles on Cu achieves a significant ammonia production rate of 628 nmol&#183;s&#8315;&#185;&#183;cm&#8315;2, along with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Approach for Tunable and Efficient Circularly Polarized Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;covalent supramolecular and intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strategy, employing bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) and judicious choice of donors, enabled tunable circularly polarized delayed luminescence in the red region with a high quantum yield of &#8764;46% and a significant |glum| value of up to &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2.








Abstract
Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states. While supramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions are well&#8208;established to improve |glum| by enhancing magnetic transition dipole components, their application to triplet&#8208;harvesting organic systems remains unexplored. In this context, our current work introduces a supramolecular strategy to achieve highly efficient and tunable circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence by the involvement of intermolecular triplet CT states. Through&#8208;space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (&#8764;46%) and a significant |glum| &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2. Additionally, the modularity of this non&#8208;covalent design allows for the tuning of emission from the orange to deep&#8208;red regions by incorporating various donors. The strategy presented here opens new avenues for designing efficient CPL&#8208;active organic phosphors.

Through-space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom-substituted bis-chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (&#8764;46%) and a significant |g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the modularity of this non-covalent design allows for the tuning of emission from the orange to deep-red regions by incorporating various donors. The strategy presented here opens new avenues for designing efficient CPL-active organic phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Atmosphere&#8208;Responsive Protective Strategy Based on Deciphering the Anode Degradation Mechanism in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the intrinsic degradation mechanism of lithium anodes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and proposes a water&#8208;responsive protective layer to prevent harmful side reactions. The designed protection strategy responds to environmental composition, ensuring anode stability and battery operation, which provides guidance for the practical application and development of advanced and durable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries, with high energy density and CO2 utilization, are considered a promising candidate for Mars exploration. However, they continue to face challenges such as limited cycle life and significant polarization caused by anode degradation, which is often overlooked and whose underlying mechanism remains unclear. This work revealed the anode failure mechanism, identifying a water&#8208;triggered degradation process, which depletes active lithium content, and developed an atmosphere&#8208;induced protective strategy. The degradation is triggered by trace water and sustained by the CO2 component, which results in transforming active lithium into Li2CO3. Thus, a strategy was provided to respond to the water molecules brought by the semi&#8208;hermetic system and high charging voltage. The protective layer was in situ polymerized and can interact with water molecules, leading to further polymerization, thereby inhibiting side reactions, significantly extending the battery's lifespan. The Li&#8211;CO2 batteries can achieve stable cycling exceeding 1000&#160;h, more than twice the time compared to the unprotected case. This study revealed the fundamental mechanism of anode degradation in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, providing a theoretical basis for the development of subsequent anode protection strategies. Additionally, it offers a viable method for anode protection in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>NO&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Nanovesicles with Co&#8208;Stimulatory Molecule Self&#8208;Presentation for Multidimensional Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasonic&#8208;empowered nanoDC that integrates NO&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer with artificial DC membrane is utilized to orchestrate a potent T cell immune response. The artificial membrane from genetically engineered CD86+ tumor cells directly activates infiltrating T cells, which are recruited by ultrasound&#8208;triggered protein S&#8208;nitrosylation and tumor ICD. The nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune activation in tumor sono&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Synergistically improving T cell responsiveness represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors; however, current treatments struggle to fully activate cancer&#8208;immunity cascade. We propose a novel gas&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanoplatform, triggering ultrasonic&#8208;sensitive tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and cascading immune activation. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the nanocore liberates reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, generating highly toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) in situ. The ONOO&#8722; then orchestrated several intracellular events, including protein S&#8208;nitrosylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ICD&#8208;enhanced immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, the biomimetic artificial dendritic cell (DC) membranes, from genetically engineered tumor cells, simultaneously present peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHC&#8208;I) and CD86, enabling homologous tumor targeting but also mimicking the antigen presentation and costimulatory signaling of DCs to directly activate infiltrating T lymphocytes. In multiple murine models, this nanovaccine demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy, including tumor suppression, long&#8208;lasting antitumor immunity, and tumor metastasis inhibition. The ultrasound&#8208;responsive nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune boosters to address the challenges of immune tolerance and suboptimal patient response.

         <title>p&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen in Two&#8208;Dimensional Amorphous RuOx for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In, which facilitates the switch from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. In contrast, doping with other elements, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, results in negligible improvements in catalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing efficient Ru&#8208;based catalysts is crucial in reducing reliance on costly Ir for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, these Ru&#8208;based catalysts face a fundamental stability challenge due to the highly reactive nature of lattice oxygen. In this work, we propose an effective strategy to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In. Notably, Ga doping exhibits remarkable acidic OER performance, leading to a 137&#160;mV reduction in overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 125&#8208;fold improvement in stability compared to undoped RuOx. This also surpasses the performances of most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. In contrast, doping with other elements from the same period, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, shows negligible improvements in catalytic performance. In situ electrochemical spectroscopic analysis, couples with theoretical calculations, reveals that the p&#8211;p orbital hybridization in the Ga&#8211;O coordination within Ga&#8211;RuOx effectively reduces the reactivity of lattice oxygen, suppresses the overoxidation of Ru, and switches the reaction pathway from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This novel p&#8211;p orbital hybridization strategy holds great potential for the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.

         <title>Facile N&#9552;N Bond Cleavage of Cis&#8208;Azobenzene with Bis&#8208;silylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpectedly easy N&#9552;N bond scission of cis&#8208;azobenzene using two bis&#8208;silylenes with different spacers and distinct SiII&#183;&#183;&#183;SiII distances is reported. While both bis&#8208;silylenes enable C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#8208;bond activation of trans&#8208;azobenzene, the cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated activation of cis&#8208;azobenzene leads to bis&#8208;silamines (Si&#9552;N) and related novel products.

The very different features of cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated N&#9552;N bond activation of trans&#8208; vs. cis&#8208;azobenzene are reported, employing two bis&#8208;silylenes with distinct intramolecular Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si distances, PhN(LSi:)&#8322; 1 (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(tBuN)&#8322;, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 2.9&#160;&#197;) and XT(LSi:)&#8322; 2 (XT&#160;=&#160;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 4.3&#160;&#197;). While trans&#8208;azobenzene reacts with both bis&#8208;silylenes to form C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#160;bond activation products, the cis&#8208;isomer undergoes only N&#9552;N bond scission. Thus, the reaction of 1 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at room temperature affords the unprecedented N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 4, featuring a bis&#8208;silaimine with terminal and bridging Si&#9552;N moieties. In contrast, the reaction of 2 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at &#8211;30 &#176;C in THF allows for the isolation of the [1+2] cycloaddition intermediate 6, containing a three&#8208;membered SiN&#8322; ring (siladiazirane), which rearranges to the N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 8 at room temperature. Compound 6 reacts with one additional equivalent of cis&#8208;azobenzene to form bis&#8208;silaazirane 7 with two SiN&#8322; rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support stepwise Si(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Si(II) cooperative activation mechanisms and provide insights into the role of bis&#8208;silylenes for selective N&#9552;N cleavage reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The unexpectedly easy N&#9552;N bond scission of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene using two bis-silylenes with different spacers and distinct Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; distances is reported. While both bis-silylenes enable C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;-bond activation of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene, the cooperative disilicon(II)-mediated activation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene leads to bis-silamines (Si&#9552;N) and related novel products.

         <title>Luminescent Detection of Photomagnetic Effect in a Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Neodymium(III)&#8211;Octacyanidotungstate(IV) Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic neodymium(III)&#8211;tungsten(IV) layered cyanido&#8208;bridged framework combines 4f&#8208;metal&#8208;centered near&#8208;infrared emission with a thermally reversible octacyanidotungstate(IV)&#8208;based photomagnetic response. As a result, it exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescent read&#8208;out of photo&#8208;induced changes in magnetization relying on the ratio between two selected peaks of excitation spectra and their temperature dependence.








Abstract
Photomagnetic materials form a class of magnetic systems, in which light irradiation changes their magnetization. Photomagnetic behavior is often observed in spin transition materials, including spin&#8208;crossover complexes, and can lead to long&#8208;range magnetic ordering. Photo&#8208;induced magnetization can affect different physical properties, including second harmonic generation. Still, despite a growing number of luminescent spin&#8208;crossover systems, the simultaneous switching of both magnetism and luminescence was not yet explored. In this regard, we present systematic studies for a novel coordination polymer composed of anionic NdIII&#8211;[WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; layers, crystallizing with chiral organic cations embedded in the interlayer space. Not only we observe and rationalize theoretically near&#8208;infrared emission of NdIII centers sensitized by [WIV(CN)8]4&#8211; units, but we also found a plausible pathway to track the photomagnetic effect throughout the analysis of the Nd3+ excitation spectra and their temperature dependence. The observed thermally reversible effects in luminescence were correlated with the results of photomagnetic studies, providing an attractive pathway to monitor the light&#8208;induced magnetization changes through a photoluminescent read&#8208;out.

         <title>Controlled Growth of Oligophenylene&#8208;Structures on Graphene for Facile Secondary Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal decomposition of different BPO&#8208;based peroxides with different substituents, dendrimeric oligophenylene structures with thicknesses up to 10&#160;nm have been grown on graphene in a controlled manner. These newly introduced structures provide active sites for further functionalization as they have a higher reactivity than the graphene lattice, as shown by their subsequent functionalization with bromomethyl groups. These functional oligophenylene structures can serve as a versatile platform for secondary functionalization, as shown by the introduction of azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The approach presented here opens up a novel route to generate nanometer&#8208;sized graphene&#8208;based materials with tailored properties for subsequent applications.








Abstract
Functionalization of graphene derivatives is a common approach to tune material properties for use in various applications. Because of the low reactivity of the unsaturated carbon lattice of graphene, not only are few chemical approaches suitable for successful functionalization, such as those involving highly reactive in situ formed radical species or nitrene and carbene compounds, but also the degree of functionalization is usually limited, modifying only a few percent of the carbon atoms. Typically, uncontrolled side reactions such as homocoupling and oligomerization of newly introduced functional groups can occur instead of direct coupling to the carbon lattice. We want to turn this unwanted side reaction into an advantage and use intentionally formed covalent dendrimeric oligophenylene structures for secondary functionalization. We show that these oligomeric structures can be grown to specific thicknesses and used for further functionalization with bromomethyl groups at high density on the surface. This functionalization opens further avenues for subsequent nucleophilic substitution, as exemplified by the introduction of versatile azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The results presented here are not only applicable to large oligophenylene structures, but also demonstrate that, in principle, single aryl moieties on graphene of any size and density can be successfully functionalized.

Abstract
We present a versatile platform for fabricating two&#8208;photon excitable carbon dot&#8208;based nanocomposite thin films by harnessing the structural versatility of polymer brushes in combination with electron&#8208;beam lithography (EBL). This approach enables the precise spatial organization of carbon dots (CDs) at the nanoscale, facilitating dynamic modulation of their photoluminescent properties in response to environmental stimuli. Three model systems were examined, incorporating pH&#8208; and thermally responsive polymers, functionalized through covalent and dynamic covalent bonding strategies. By leveraging the spatial control afforded by nanostructured polymer brushes, we achieved precise tuning of optical properties while mitigating aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, a longstanding challenge in solid&#8208;state CD applications. In addition to the advances in controlling optical properties, this work highlights the potential of polymer brush systems to function as optically active, reprogrammable surfaces. The resulting nanoscale&#8208;engineered materials exhibit highly responsive, reconfigurable photonic behavior, offering a scalable pathway for integrating advanced optical interfaces into microchip technologies, biosensing platforms, and multiplexed diagnostic systems. The fusion of polymer brushes, carbon dots, and advanced lithographic techniques marks a substantial advancement in the development of functional materials with nanoscale precision and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind UV Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve solar&#8208;blind UV mechanoluminescent (ML) materials through strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode. DPO3C and DPO4C exhibited solar&#8208;blind UV emission with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm, with wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions from 293 to 741&#160;nm via host&#8211;guest doping. This study also paves the way for advancements in bright&#8208;field stress visualization.








Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 to 741&#160;nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.

DPO3C and DPO4C exhibited solar-blind UV emission with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm, with wide-range color-tunable ML emissions from 293 to 741&#160;nm via host&#8211;guest doping. This study also paves the way for advancements in bright-field stress visualization.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real-time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML-based sensors can be only used in dark-field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm (in solar-blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar-blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide-range color-tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 to 741&#160;nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar-blind UV ML materials and makes bright-field environment ML sensors possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lysine&#8208;Targeting, Covalent Inhibitors of Bromodomain BD1 of BET Proteins in Live Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully developed the first BD1&#8208;targted covalent inhibitor (TCI), BDS4, by utilizing 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA). Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to the marginal effects of BD2 inhibitor RVX&#8208;208. Our developed tool showed clear advantages of long&#8208;lasting domain&#8208;selective TCI in delineating the district function of BD1 and BD2. 








Abstract
The bromodomain extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan&#8208;BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1&#8208; or BD2&#8208;selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine&#8208;reactive covalent warheads herein we report a set of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; P3&#8211;P7) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals. Chemoproteomic experiments with P7, which utilizes 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA), identified 16 endogenous BRDs, thus giving a global landscape of ligandable lysines in BRDs. By further introducing EBA and salicylaldehyde into PLX51107 (a noncovalent BETi), we generated lysine&#8208;reactive, irreversible (BDS1&#8211;4) and reversible (BDS5&#8211;6) BD1 covalent inhibitors. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the successful covalent engagement between EBA and K91 near the acetylated lysine (Kac)&#8208;binding site of BD1 in BRD4. BDS4 showed 104&#8208;fold selectivity for BD1 over BD2 with prolonged anticancer effects. Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to RVX&#8208;208 (a reported BD2&#8208;selective noncovalent inhibitor), which showed only marginal effects. Our work serves as a useful tool to delineate distinct functions of BD1 and BD2 in future studies.

         <title>Design Strategies Based on Electronic Interactions for Effective Catalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of effective bidirectional electrocatalyst focused on electronic interactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Development of effective bidirectional catalyst is essential for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The catalytic activity of catalyst is directly related to the degree of the interaction between the catalysts and adsorbates. In the review, we introduce the design strategy for catalysts with high catalytic activity focused on the electronic structure and properties of catalysts and reactants.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density (&gt;500&#160;W h kg&#8722;1). However, LSBs exhibit an unsatisfactory energy density (&lt;400&#160;W h kg&#8722;1) and cycle life (&lt;300 cycles) because of the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates and the sluggish conversion reaction kinetics caused by insulating sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Although various types of catalysts, including metal&#8208;based compounds to single&#8208;atom catalysts, have been reported to address these issues, most catalysts exhibited limited catalytic activity under practical lean electrolyte conditions (&lt;5&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). A comprehensive understanding of the synthetic strategy and catalytic mechanism of catalysts is essential for their design, but understanding the electronic effects of the catalysts and LiPS is more important. Furthermore, the electronic design of these catalysts is not well understood. In this review, we introduce the catalytic mechanisms in LSBs and discuss catalyst design strategies in terms of electronic effects on the interactions between reactants and catalysts, with a primary focus on heterogeneous catalytic systems. We additionally consider how the electronic property of homogeneous systems, particularly redox mediators, affects catalytic behavior under lean electrolyte conditions and propose future research directions for catalyst development in LSBs.

         <title>Iron(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Hydroxylation of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene Coupled with Short Chain Branching Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative degradation enables C&#9472;H hydroxylation of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) along with the growth of methyl and ethyl short&#8208;chain branches. Fluorine on the ligand enhances the interaction with LDPE while facilitating hydrogen peroxide activation. The growth of short&#8208;chain branches occurs via &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. The oxidized LDPE exhibits significantly improved mechanical properties. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely used in packaging applications, but after being discarded its environmental impact is a pressing concern due to a lack of effective chemical recycling strategies, especially owing to its chemical inertness and nonpolar nature. To address these challenges, we present a mild iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative upcycling of LDPE in which C&#9472;H hydroxylation of LDPE occurs coupled with the growth of methyl short chain branching (Me&#8208;SCB) and ethyl shortchain branching (Et&#8208;SCB). As a result, the resulting products achieve significant improvements in surface wettability, crystallinity, and mechanical properties despite a concomitant reduction in molecular weight. CH&#8230;F interactions and &#963;&#8211;&#960; interactions are found between LDPE and the catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the catalytic mechanism that fluorine on the ligand facilitates hydrogen peroxide activation and subsequent deprotonation, leading to the formation of high&#8208;valent ironoxo species. The growth of short&#8208;chain branching (SCB) involves the &#946;&#8208;scission of CC bonds and a radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;walking mechanism. This work represents a transformative advancement in deep understanding of polyolefin upcycling and opens a new approach of polyolefin functionalization and architecture modulation.

         <title>Selenite&#8208;Directed Organotin&#8211;Oxo Macrocycles for Nanolithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four high&#8208;nuclearity organotin&#8211;oxo macrocyclic clusters&#8212;Sn8, Sn12&#8208;&#945;, Sn12&#8208;&#946;, and Sn12Fe18&#8212;were successfully constructed utilizing the unique trigonal pyramidal geometry of selenite ligands, and then their lithographic performance was systematically investigated.








Abstract
The systematic design of organotin&#8211;oxo macrocycles with enhanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photon&#8208;harvesting capability and sub&#8208;50&#160;nm lithographic resolution remains a pivotal challenge in advancing nanofabrication technologies. Herein, we present a novel series of polynuclear nbutyltin&#8211;oxygen macrocycles&#8212;Sn8, Sn12&#8208;&#945;, Sn12&#8208;&#946;, and Sn12Fe18&#8212;constructed through selenite ligand&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly. Among these, Sn12&#8208;&#945; demonstrated exceptional electron beam lithography (EBL) performance, achieving a critical dimension resolution of 50&#160;nm at a low dose of 50 &#181;C&#183;cm&#8722;2, attributed to its elevated Sn/Se content, compact molecular architecture (diameter, 1.5&#160;nm), and excellent film&#8208;forming ability (surface roughness, 0.59&#160;nm). By replacing conventional carboxylate ligands with inorganic selenite, this study addresses longstanding limitations in structural versatility and EUV absorption efficiency inherent to traditional organotin&#8211;oxo systems. These findings establish a paradigm for engineering metal&#8211;oxide photoresists through ligand&#8208;driven cluster dimensionality control, offering a scalable pathway to high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution patterning for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.

By replacing conventional carboxylate ligands with inorganic selenite, this study addresses longstanding limitations in structural versatility and EUV absorption efficiency inherent to traditional organotin&#8211;oxo systems. These findings establish a paradigm for engineering metal&#8211;oxide photoresists through ligand-driven cluster dimensionality control, offering a scalable pathway to high-sensitivity, high-resolution patterning for next-generation semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Activation of C&#9472;H Bond in Toluene by Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Supported Subnanometric PtOx Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrocatalytic activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in hydrocarbon molecules to produce valuable oxygenates still suffers from the limited generation of reactive species and the weak adsorption of reactants. This study achieved the selective oxidation of toluene using a TiO2 supported subnanometric PtOx cluster (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode via an electrophilic OH*&#8208;mediated pathway. The modification of PtOx cluster can facilitate toluene adsorption and OH* generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a subnanometric PtOx cluster&#8208;loaded TiO2 (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4&#8208;fold higher than that of pristine TiO2. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate a self&#8208;powered PEC tandem device with S&#8208;shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of &#8764;170&#160;&#181;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtOx/TiO2 photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)&#8208;mediated pathway, which can suppress the over&#8208;oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that subnanometric PtOx clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue toward the activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Ionic Liquids by Combined Pulse EPR and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids have been proposed as alternatives to molecular solvents. Here, spin probes and spin&#8208;labelled ILs are studied by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, revealing the IL interaction sphere. The results challenge previous interpretations of nitroxide&#8208;solvent nanostructuring in ILs.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are a unique class of compounds that have attracted interest for numerous and diverse applications, ranging from solvents for sustainable synthesis to sustainable electrolytes. Understanding their nanostructure and solute&#8208;solvent interactions is a prerequisite to harnessing the full potential of ILs. It has been proposed that ILs solvate non&#8208;polar solutes via their alkyl chains through the formation of nanoscale structures, such as micelles. Here, we determine the non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for such nanostructuring in ILs. We use pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with ILs tailored to probe specific interactions through spin and isotopic labelling. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular cation&#8211;anion interactions are probed by electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and 19F PRE experiments and show that nitroxide solutes associate with the polar domains of the imidazolium cation through weak hydrogen bonding with the imidazolium ring protons, as supported by MD simulations. Thus, this study reveals a less structured nanostructure than a micellar picture might suggest, but with clear IL cation&#8208;solute interactions. Our methodology to reveal nanostructure not only has implications for ILs but is also applicable to other soft matter systems.

         <title>p&#8211;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of halogenated COF nanoemitters via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The introduction of halogen atoms facilitates p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within COF skeleton, leading to a 49&#8208;fold ECL enhancement compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8211;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8211;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.

We describe a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, affording various valuable arylethylamines with exclusive regiocontrol.

Abstract
Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;Markovnikov&lt;/i&gt;-selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio- and enantioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;Energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material descriptors are first proposed to guide the design and screening of high&#8208;energy density p&#8208;type organic cathode materials. Triphenylamine and synthesized p&#8208;PZA POP proved the rationality of these descriptors. Na||p&#8208;PZA POP batteries exhibit a surprisingly high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50&#160;&#176;C (166.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1) to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (141.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;Coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets has been successfully developed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. The isolated Mo sites optimize the driving force of photogenerated holes, which greatly accelerates the electron transfer rate of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;concentration alkyl radicals.








Abstract
Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficient utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develmically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400&#160;nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picoseconds. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#9472;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation.

         <title>Coronal Complexation Induces Snowman&#8208;Shaped Janus Polymersome Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snowman&#8208;like Janus polymersomes were produced in a simple, yet versatile two&#8208;step approach involving a plasticizing agent and a cationic polymer additive to complex with the charged polymersome. Shape transformation was driven by coronal complexation altering membrane structure, followed by segregation of the polymer additive to form a protruding bleb of the Janus polymersome.








Abstract
Engineering polymersome shape is a keen area of interest because minimal variations in polymersome properties can greatly affect the performance of nanoreactors, drug delivery vehicles, and more. Although methods to transform polymersome shapes have been evolving rapidly, limitations remain in the scope of applicable polymersome compositions and adaptability to engineer a desired shape. In this work, we developed a method utilizing cationic polymer additives and coronal complexation to transform charged spherical polymersomes into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. The resulting morphologies feature a hollow polymersome compartment conjoined to a protruding bleb consisting of the complexed polymer additive, which we propose forms via a dewetting process. This methodology provides enhanced shape control through adjustments in additive composition or plasticizer content, offering additional routes to engineering novel polymersome structures.

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatially controlled occlusion of polymeric nanoparticles into cuprous oxide (Cu2O) systematically alters lattice distortion, oxygen vacancy content, and catalytic efficiency in the resulting composite crystals, offering a robust framework for the development of advanced functional composite materials.








Abstract
Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in a spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from the surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.

         <title>Integrative Lattice and Surface Engineering of Nanoscale Fe0 for Superior Dechlorination of Trichloroethene in Groundwater: Coordination in Reactivity, Selectivity, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice and surface engineering strategy was employed to synthesize a novel core&#8208;shell nanomaterial for superior reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene. In this design, FeNi serves as the core and FeS as the shell. Core composition and shell properties interactively determine materials&#8217; performance, and the optimal material exhibited 242.7&#8208;fold higher reactivity and 81.2&#8208;fold greater selectivity compared to the unmodified counterpart.








Abstract
Nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nFe0) materials hold great promise in environmental remediation, yet achieving high reactivity, selectivity, and stability in reduction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we address this challenge by employing Ni lattice and FeS surface engineering to fabricate novel nFe0&#8208;based nanomaterials (dubbed as FeNix@FeSy), featuring FeNi as the core and FeS as the shell. The FeNi5@FeS10 delivered approximately 242.7&#8208; and 81.2&#8208;times higher reactivity and selectivity, respectively, over unmodified nFe&#176; for the remediation of trichloroethene (TCE; a notorious environmental pollutant), while maintaining high stability in groundwater remediation. We found that the core composition (i.e., Ni/Fe ratio) of FeNix@FeSy primarily determined reactivity, governed by a tradeoff between the galvanic effect and lattice strain, while shell properties mainly controlled selectivity, despite some interactions between them. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the FeS surface served as a favorable adsorption site for TCE, and the low energy barriers (TS2, 0.19&#160;eV) of FeNi5@FeS10 facilitated the cleavage of the first chlorine from TCE. Moreover, the core&#8208;shell structure promoted electron transfer from the core to the shell and TCE. This integrative lattice and surface engineering strategy provides a new avenue for designing advanced functional materials for environmental remediation and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;A lattice and surface engineering strategy was employed to synthesize a novel core-shell nanomaterial for superior reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene. In this design, FeNi serves as the core and FeS as the shell. Core composition and shell properties interactively determine materials&#8217; performance, and the optimal material exhibited 242.7-fold higher reactivity and 81.2-fold greater selectivity compared to the unmodified counterpart.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nFe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) materials hold great promise in environmental remediation, yet achieving high reactivity, selectivity, and stability in reduction remains a long-standing challenge. Here we address this challenge by employing Ni lattice and FeS surface engineering to fabricate novel nFe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-based nanomaterials (dubbed as FeNi&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;@FeS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;), featuring FeNi as the core and FeS as the shell. The FeNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;@FeS&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; delivered approximately 242.7- and 81.2-times higher reactivity and selectivity, respectively, over unmodified nFe&#176; for the remediation of trichloroethene (TCE; a notorious environmental pollutant), while maintaining high stability in groundwater remediation. We found that the core composition (i.e., Ni/Fe ratio) of FeNi&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;@FeS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; primarily determined reactivity, governed by a tradeoff between the galvanic effect and lattice strain, while shell properties mainly controlled selectivity, despite some interactions between them. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the FeS surface served as a favorable adsorption site for TCE, and the low energy barriers (TS2, 0.19&#160;eV) of FeNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;@FeS&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; facilitated the cleavage of the first chlorine from TCE. Moreover, the core-shell structure promoted electron transfer from the core to the shell and TCE.

         <title>Strain Energy Induced Rotary Speed Acceleration in a Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy accelerates rotary speed in overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors by tuning cycloparaphenylene loop size, preserving core structures. Strain energy variations drive hierarchical acceleration up to 389&#8208;fold. This study systematically reveals motor behavior under strain, offering new avenues for engineering light&#8208;driven nanomachines.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors based on overcrowded alkenes represent a major type of molecular machines that are able to rotate unidirectionally. The regulation of the rotary speed without altering the core structure of a motor is crucial and remains a major challenge. In the present study, we reported that the rotary speed of molecular motors can be significantly enhanced by harnessing the strain energy of cycloparaphenylene (CPP). A series of molecular motors incorporated in CPP with varying sizes were synthesized, and their photochemical and thermal isomerization behaviors were meticulously examined using UV&#8211;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The remarkable increase of the acceleration effect of the rotary speed with decreasing macrocycle sizes, up to 389&#8208;fold, can be attributed to the strain energy induced bending in the stator part, which reduces steric hindrance in the &#8220;fjord region&#8221; of the molecule, supported by a detailed computational study employing density functional theory. This work provides systematic insight into the behavior of molecular motors under strain energy, thereby paving the way for the application of motor&#8208;incorporating CPPs as a general strategy to accelerate the rotary speed of molecular motors.

         <title>Lattice Water Deprotonation Enables Potassium&#8208;Ion Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abnormal water deprotonation in a lattice has been predicted in a chained model by density functional theory calculations and further verified by isotropic tracing and experimental electrochemical investigations. The lattice water deprotonation reaction in the initial charging process enables thereafter reversible potassium&#8208;ion insertion/desertion.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a key process in clean energy applications and usually occurs on the surface of catalytic materials. Here, we report the anomalous partial water splitting, namely, water deprotonation behavior within the lattice of hydrated materials modeled by Fe1&#8208;xMgx(C2O4) &#8226; 2H2O (x&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.25&#8211;0.43), which triggers the otherwise inactive framework into an excellent cathode material for potassium ion storage. Density functional theory suggests that redox&#8208;active lattice Fe sites can split crystal water into hydroxyls and hydrogens in the initial charge, rendering thereafter reversible K&#8208;ion chemistries, whereas lattice Mg sites are inactive but stabilize the entire framework. Our experiments validated the as&#8208;predicted electrochemical behavior, and the isotopic tracing unambiguously confirmed the hydrogen evolution from crystal water. This intriguing &#8220;water deprotonation in lattice&#8221; phenomenon may open a new path for the design of cathode materials by electrolysis&#8208;assisted electrochemistry.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Induced Br&#248;nsted Acidity Enables Controllable Hydrocracking of Polyolefin Waste to Liquid Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/NbOx nanorod catalyst enables efficient polyolefin hydrocracking, achieving 95% yield of liquid fuels (C5&#8211;20) under mild conditions. Operando spectroscopy and DFT reveal Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated via hydrogen spillover, as key catalytic sites, exhibiting a near&#8208;linear correlation with hydrocracking activity.








Abstract
Efficient upcycling of polyolefin waste into liquid fuels remains challenging due to over&#8208;cracking and the lack of sufficient acidity in non&#8208;zeolitic catalysts. Here, we report a Ni/niobium oxide nanorod (Ni/NbOx) catalyst that achieves 95% selectivity to C5&#8211;20&#8203; alkanes at full polyethylene (PE) conversion under mild conditions (240&#160;&#176;C), with minimal gaseous products (4%). The catalyst reaches a high liquid fuel formation rate of 1274 gliquid&#8203; gNi&#8722;1&#8203; h&#8722;1, rivaling noble metal systems. Its performance is governed by the morphology and crystallinity of NbOx nanorods, which provide sufficient acidity without micropore confinement, mitigating diffusion limitations and over&#8208;cracking. Detailed operando infrared spectroscopy and computational studies reveal, for the first time, that Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated in situ via hydrogen spillover on the (110) facet, are the key catalytic sites in niobium oxide&#8208;based catalysts. The density of these acid sites exhibits a linear correlation with hydrocracking activity. The catalyst also demonstrates high efficiency across diverse polyolefin feedstocks and excellent reusability, offering a scalable and cost&#8208;effective solution for plastic upcycling.

         <title>Why Does the Performance of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalysts Decrease in Acidic Conditions?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts proceeds through electron injection into the &#960;* orbital, triggered by the hydrogenation of pyridinic nitrogen. By closely tracking the changes in the electronic state during the reaction, we have reported that the decrease in ORR activity in acidic electrolytes is due to the protonation of pyridinic nitrogen, which precedes its hydrogenation.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has emerged as a promising low&#8208;cost and durable alternative to platinum catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, its catalytic activity decreases significantly in acidic electrolytes, limiting the practical applications. Here, we report the degradation mechanisms of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts, focusing on the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N), which serves the primary active site. We found that the electrochemical hydrogenation of pyri&#8208;N to pyri&#8208;NH, coupled with oxygen adsorption, is a critical process. Although this reaction occurs at higher potentials in basic electrolytes, it shifts to lower potentials in acidic environments due to the protonation and stabilization of pyri&#8208;N. These results demonstrate that the decrease of the catalytic activity in acidic electrolytes is tied to the basicity of pyri&#8208;N. By controlling the basicity of pyri&#8208;N, specifically its pKa, a guideline for enhancing the ORR and other electrode reactions has been established.
