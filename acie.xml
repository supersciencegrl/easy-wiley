      <title>Surface Coordination of Multiple Ligands Endows N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters with High Robustness and Surface Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Deciphering the molecular pictures of the multi&#8208;component and non&#8208;periodic organic&#8208;inorganic interlayer is a grand technical challenge. Here we show that the atomic arrangement of hybrid surface ligands on metal nanoparticles can be precisely quantified through comprehensive characterization of a novel gold cluster, Au  44  (  i  Pr  2  &#8208;bimy)  9  (PA)  6  Br  8  , which features three types of ligands, namely, carbene (1,3&#8208;diisopropylbenzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene,  i  Pr  2  &#8208;bimy), alkynyl (phenylacetylide, PA), and halide (Br), respectively. The delicately balanced stereochemical effects and bonding capabilities of the three ligands give rise to peculiar geometrical and electronic structures. Remarkably, despite its complex and highly distorted surface structure, Au  44  (  i  Pr  2  &#8208;bimy)  9  (PA)  6  Br  8  exhibits unusual catalytic properties and yet it is highly stable, both chemically and thermally. Moreover, rich reactive sites on the cluster surface raise the prospect of bio&#8208;compatibility (as it can be functionalized to yield water&#8208;soluble derivatives) and bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of neutral palladium&#8208;oxo clusters Pd16 and Pd24 and their supramolecular interactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the synthesis, structure and physicochemical characterization of the first three examples of neutral palladium&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs). The 16&#8208;palladium(II)&#8208;oxo cluster [Pd  16  O  24  (OH)  8  ((CH  3  )  2  As)  8  ] (  Pd  16  ) comprises a cyclic palladium&#8208;oxo unit capped by eight dimethylarsinate groups.

      <title>Kinetic Resolution of Aziridines Enabled by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Car&#8208;bene/Copper Cooperative Catalysis: Carbene Dose&#8208;Controlled Chemo&#8208;Switchability</title>
      <dc:description>Asymmetric methods that convert racemic starting materials to enantioenriched products are inherently significant in chemical synthesis.

      <title>Adrenergic modulation with photochromic ligands</title>

      <title>Oxidation Control of Bottlebrush Molecular Conformation for Producing Libraries of Photonic Structures</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly is important for creating photonic structures, and structural color is tunable typically relying on size&#8208;varied building blocks obtained by time&#8208;consuming chemical synthesis. Herein, molecular conformation of bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in solution is successfully manipulated  to create libraries of photonic structures  . Amphiphilic BBCPs bearing oxidation&#8208;responsive ferrocene groups on the hydrophilic block are used to fabricate porous particles via evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W/O) double emulsions stabilized by the BBCP surfactant. In&#8208;situ oxidation of the ferrocene groups by hydrogen peroxide at the W/O interface leads to enhanced hydrophilicity, more hydration, and chain extension of the hydrophilic block. Consequently, larger internal water droplets are spontaneously formed, yielding larger pores within the microparticles. The pore diameter is readily tunable from 144 to 301 nm with a single BBCP, generating full&#8208;spectrum structural colors. This work provides a straightforward method for fabrication of libraries of photonic pigments in an easy and scalable manner.</dc:description>

Amphiphilic BBCPs bearing oxidation&#8208;responsive ferrocene groups on the hydrophilic block are used to fabricate porous particles via evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W/O) double emulsions stabilized by the BBCP surfactant. In&#8208;situ oxidation of the ferrocene groups by hydrogen peroxide at the W/O interface leads to enhanced hydrophilicity, more hydration, and chain extension of the hydrophilic block. Consequently, larger internal water droplets are spontaneously formed, yielding larger pores within the microparticles. The pore diameter is readily tunable from 144 to 301 nm with a single BBCP, generating full&#8208;spectrum structural colors. This work provides a straightforward method for fabrication of libraries of photonic pigments in an easy and scalable manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Autonomous Transient pH Flips Shaped by Layered Compartmentalization of Antagonistic Enzymatic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Transient signaling orchestrates complex spatiotemporal behaviour in living organisms via (bio)chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Compartmentalization of signal&#8208;processing is an important aspect for controlling such networks. However, artificial CRNs mostly focus on homogeneous solutions to program autonomous self&#8208;assembling systems, which limits their accessible behaviour and tuneability. Here, we introduce layered compartments housing antagonistic pH&#8208;modulating enzymes, and demonstrate that transient pH signals in a supernatant solution can be programmed based on spatial delays. This overcomes limitations of activity mismatches of antagonistic enzymes in solution and allows to flexibly program acidic and alkaline pH lifecycles beyond possibilities of homogeneous solutions. Lag time, lifetime, and the pH minima and maxima can be precisely programmed by adjusting spatial and kinetic conditions. We integrate these spatially controlled pH flips with switchable peptides, furnishing time&#8208;programmed self&#8208;assemblies and hydrogel material system.</dc:description>

      <title>17.1%&#8208;Efficient Eco&#8208;Compatible Organic Solar Cells from a

      <dc:description>To elevate the perf&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;ormance of polymer solar cells (PSC) processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents, a dissymmetric fused&#8208;ring acceptor BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 with chlorine and trifluoromethyl end groups has been designed and synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data suggests that BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 has a 3D network packing structure as a result of synergistic H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregations between adjacent molecules, which will strengthen its charge transport as an acceptor material. When PBDB&#8208;TF was used as a donor, the toluene&#8208;processed binary device realized a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.31%, which was further improved to 17.12% when PC71ThBM was added as the third component. An efficiency of over 17% is currently the highest record among polymer solar cells processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents. Compared to its symmetric counterparts BTIC&#8208;4Cl and BTIC&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#947;, the dissymmetric BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 integrates their merits, having further optimized the molecular aggregations with excellent storage and photo&#8208;stability, and also extending the maximum absorption peak in film to 852 nm. As a low band&#8208;gap acceptor with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, the BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3&#8208;based semitransparent PSCs (ST&#8208;PSCs) with 24.45% average transmittance (AVT) yields a high PCE of 13.06% from same halogen&#8208;free solvent. The devices exhibit good transparency from the outdoor image through the ST&#8208;PSCs, indicating a promising utilization potential of semitransparent building integrated photovoltaics (ST&#8208;BIPV).

      <title>Coenzymes and Their Role in the Evolution of Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Although coenzymes play key roles in biotic metabolism, they have not been in the focus as elements in protometabolism nor has their possible prebiotic generation been discussed in detail. This Review provides a conceptual view of the role of coenzymes with respect to known theories of protometabolism and their incorporation into the RNA world hypothesis.







Abstract
The evolution of coenzymes, or their impact on the origin of life, is fundamental for understanding our own existence. Having established reasonable hypotheses about the emergence of prebiotic chemical building blocks, which were probably created under palaeogeochemical conditions, and surmising that these smaller compounds must have become integrated to afford complex macromolecules such as RNA, the question of coenzyme origin and its relation to the evolution of functional biochemistry should gain new impetus. Many coenzymes have a simple chemical structure and are often nucleotide&#8208;derived, which suggests that they may have coexisted with the emergence of RNA and may have played a pivotal role in early metabolism. Based on current theories of prebiotic evolution, which attempt to explain the emergence of privileged organic building blocks, this Review discusses plausible hypotheses on the prebiotic formation of key elements within selected extant coenzymes. In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of life.

      <title>Evidence of phenolic pool as a key intermediate for zeolite&#8208;catalyzed lignin pyrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Phenolic pool is considered to be an important intermediate during&#160;catalytic conversion of biomass. However, no direct evidence has been reported on its full picture in molecular level, due to the huge challenges in probing the reactive and low volatile phenolic oligomers with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. Herein, we reported online detection and structural identification of phenolic pool by utilizing an in situ atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the phenolic pool is formed through monomers' repolymerization with an equidistant grouped pattern, and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke. The exploration of the real reactive species is also of great importance for the rational design and synthesis of advanced catalysts with high activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Flow Electrolyzer Mass Spectrometry with a Gas Diffusion Electrode Design</title>
      <dc:description>Operando mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to probe reaction intermediates near the surface of catalyst in electrochemical systems. For electrochemical reactions involving gas reactants, conventional operando mass spectrometry struggles in detecting reaction intermediates because the batch&#8208;type electrochemical reactor can only handle a very limited current density due to the low solubility of gas reactant(s). Herein, we developed a new technique, namely flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design, which enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities (&gt;100 mA cm&#8208;2). As a case study, we investigated the electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) on polycrystalline copper and elucidated the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation. Combining FEMS and isotopic labelling, we showed that the oxygen in the as&#8208;formed acetaldehyde intermediate originates from the reactant CO, while ethanol and n&#8208;propanol contained mainly solvent oxygen. The observation highlights the complexity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed eCORR and provides direct experimental evidence into an isotopic scrambling mechanism, where acetaldehyde is going through oxygen exchange before further reduction to ethanol.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Single&#8208;Site Nanozyme for Tumor&#8208;Specific Amplified Cascade Enzymatic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity (nanozyme) are at the targeted frontier for therapeutic interventions. However, it still remains a formidable challenge to selectively kill tumor cells through enzymatic reactions, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Herein, a new strategy is presented by developing single&#8208;site cascade enzymatic reaction for tumor&#8208;specific therapy while avoiding off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. Copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu&#8208;HCF) nanozyme with active single&#8208;site copper exhibits cascade enzymatic activity (i.e., glutathione oxidase and peroxidase) within tumor microenvironment. Results show that Cu&#8208;HCF single&#8208;site nanozymes (SSNEs) first exert tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase ability through depleting intracellular glutathione and converting single&#8208;site CuII species to CuI for subsequent amplified peroxidase activity via Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8208;Weiss reaction, and thus substantial highly toxic hydroxyl radicals are generated for tumor cell apoptosis. Our work demonstrates that SSNEs could amplify the killing efficacy of singlet oxygen species and suppress the tumor growth in vivo, providing a promising self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;site nanozyme for amplified cascade enzymatic anticancer application.</dc:description>

      <title>How Oxygen&#8208;binding Enhances Long&#8208;range Electron Transfer: Lessons from Reduction of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases by Cellobiose Dehydrogenase</title>
      <dc:description>Long&#8208;range electron transfer (ET) in metalloenzymes is a general and fundamental process governing activation and O  2  reduction. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET, is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. Interestingly, we find that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O  2  , directly leads to LPMO&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;O  2  &#8226;  , bypassing formation of the generally suggested LPMO&#8208;Cu(I) species. The uncovered ET mechanism rationalizes experimental observations and has far&#8208;reaching implications in LPMO catalysis, as well as the O  2  or CO binding&#8208;enhanced long&#8208;range ET processes in other metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Photocatalytic N  2  fixation to NH  3  with water as the reducing agent represents a promising future strategy for ammonia synthesis, motivating the discovery of efficient photocatalysts that offer high sunlight utilization and catalytic efficiency to N  2  fixation.

Noticeably, a majority of Cu  2  O photocatalysts synthesized to date with large lateral sizes (typically tens to hundreds of nanometers) generally suffer from severe electron&#8208;hole recombination and limited surface sites, restricting its photocatalytic activity for potential N  2  fixation. Ultrafine photocatalysts with lateral dimensions ~1&#8208;3 nm offer distinct advantages over conventional nanoparticle&#8208;based photocatalysts in this context, though the controlled synthesis of ultrafine photocatalysts remains challenging.

      <title>Tandem Mn&#8208;I exchange and homocoupling processes mediated by a synergistically operative lithium manganate</title>
      <dc:description>Pairing lithium and manganese(II) to form lithium manganate [Li  2  Mn(CH  2  SiMe  3  )  4  ] (  2b  ) enables the efficient direct Mn&#8208;I exchange of aryliodides, affording transient (aryl)lithium manganate intermediates which in turn undergo spontaneous C&#8208;C homocoupling at room temperature to furnish a range of symmetrical (bis)aryls in good yields under mild reaction conditions. Combining EPR with X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies light has been shone on the mixed Li/Mn constitution of the organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions, including the homocoupling step which had previously been thought to occur via single&#8208;metal Mn aryl species. These studies have illuminated how Li and Mn work together in a synergistic manner to facilitate both the Mn&#8208;I exchange and the C&#8208;C bond forming steps. Both steps are carefully synchronised, with the alkyliodide ICH  2  SiMe  3  &#160;concomitantly generated during the Mn&#8208;I exchange, being essential to enable the aryl homocoupling process by acting as an  in&#8208;situ  generated oxidant.</dc:description>

      <title>&#963;&#8208;Conjugation and H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly: Key Features for Efficient Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescent Organic Molecular Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic molecular crystals attracts great attention. The features of the persistent luminescence strongly depend on the electronic properties of the molecular components, mainly p&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) chromophores, and on their molecular packing in the crystal. Here, a new strategy is developed by rationally designing two isomeric molecular phosphors incorporating and combining for the first time a bridge for &#963;&#8208;conjugation between the D and A units and a structure&#8208;directing unit for H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Quantum chemical calculations highlight the critical role played by the two degrees of freedom of the s&#8208;conjugated bridge, on the chromophore optical properties. The molecular crystals exhibit RTP quantum yields up to 20% and lifetimes up to 520 ms. On the other hand, the crystal structures of the efficient phosphorescent materials establish the existence of an unprecedented well&#8208;organization of the emitters into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rectangular &#8216;columnar&#8208;like&#8217; supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding.

      <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective (3+3) Cycloaddition of Nitrones with 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols Enabled by Cooperative Organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The regio&#8208; and enantioselective (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols was accomplished by the cooperative catalysis of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA).

      <title>Spectroscopic and electrokinetic evidence for a bifunctional mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential anodic reaction in many energy storage processes. OER is most often proposed to occur via a mechanism involving four consecutive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps, which imposes a performance limit due to the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates. A bifunctional OER mechanism, in which the energetically demanding step of the attack of hydroxide on a metal oxo unit is facilitated by a hydrogen atom transfer to a second site, has the potential to circumvent the scaling relationship. However, the bifunctional mechanism has hitherto only been supported by theoretical computations. Here we describe an operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The data support two distinct mechanisms for the two catalysts: FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate&#8208;determining O&#8208;O bond forming step is the OH  &#8208;  attack on a Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a Ni  III  &#8208;O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive PCET steps. The experimental validation of the bifunctional mechanism enhances the understanding of OER catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Acquiring High&#8208;Tc Layered Metal Halide Ferroelectrics via Cage&#8208;Confined Ethylamine Rotators</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) ferroelectrics have attracted widespread interest in the field of optoelectronics, due to the combination of excellent semiconducting and ferroelectric properties. Curie temperature (  T  c  ) below which ferroelectricity exists, is a crucial parameter for ferroelectrics. However, the lack of research on  T  c  tuning of 2D OIHP ferroelectrics hinders their further progress. Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)  2  (EA)Pb  2  Br  7  (  2L  ; IBA =  isob  utylammonium), and (IBA)  2  (EA)  2  Pb  3  Br  10  (  3L  ). Intriguingly,  T  c  is successfully tuned from 326 K (  2L  ) to 370 K (  3L  ) with increased layer&#8208;thickness. Structural and computational analyses suggest that  the improvement of  T  c  is due to the higher phase transition energy barrier triggered by cage&#8208;confined EAs rotators with increased layer&#8208;thickness.  This work suggests that EA is an effective &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; to rationally design high&#8208;  T  c  2D OIHP ferroelectrics. In light of &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; strategy, one can expect more 2D OIHP ferroelectrics with promising performance.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) ferroelectrics have attracted widespread interest in the field of optoelectronics, due to the combination of excellent semiconducting and ferroelectric properties. Curie temperature (  T  c  ) below which ferroelectricity exists, is a crucial parameter for ferroelectrics. However, the lack of research on  T  c  tuning of 2D OIHP ferroelectrics hinders their further progress. Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)  2  (EA)Pb  2  Br  7  (  2L  ; IBA =  isob  utylammonium), and (IBA)  2  (EA)  2  Pb  3  Br  10  (  3L  ). Intriguingly,  T  c  is successfully tuned from 326 K (  2L  ) to 370 K (  3L  ) with increased layer&#8208;thickness. Structural and computational analyses suggest that  the improvement of  T  c  is due to the higher phase transition energy barrier triggered by cage&#8208;confined EAs rotators with increased layer&#8208;thickness.  This work suggests that EA is an effective &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; to rationally design high&#8208;  T  c  2D OIHP ferroelectrics. In light of &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; strategy, one can expect more 2D OIHP ferroelectrics with promising performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Biomimetic Recognition and Optical Sensing of Carboxylic Acids in Water by Using a Buried Salt Bridge and the Hydrophobic Effect</title>
      <dc:description>Buried salt bridges widely exist in protein structures, but are rarely used in synthetic systems for molecular recognition in water. By mimicking the binding pocket of bioreceptors, we designed and synthesized a pair of  endo  &#8208;functionalized macrocyclic hosts with secondary ammoniums in a hydrophobic cavity. We found that these macrocycles are able to selectively recognize carboxylic acids in water through salt bridges and the hydrophobic effect. Moreover, it was demonstrated that these macrocyclic receptors can be used in CD&#8208;based optical chirality sensing of chiral carboxylic acids and fluorescent sensing of phenylpyruvic acid &#8211; a biomarker for phenylketonuria. This research showcases that buried salt bridges can be effectively used by  endo  &#8208;functionalized macrocyclic hosts for molecular recognition in water where solvent screening on polar noncovalent interactions is high.</dc:description>

      <title>The Origin of Selective Adsorption of CO2 on Merlinoite Zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we describe the CO2  adsorption behavior at 25&#8208;75 &#176;C and 0&#8722;1.0 bar of various alkali cation&#8208;exchanged forms of merlinoite (framework type MER) zeolites with Si/Al = 2.3 and 3.8. The adsorption isotherms at 25 &#176;C on the Na+  , K+  , Rb+  , and Cs+  forms of MER zeolite with Si/Al = 2.3 are characterized by a clear step, the CO2  pressure of which differs notably according to the type of their extraframework cations. Structural analysis shows that CO2  adsorption on the former three zeolites includes the relocation of gating cations with high site occupancy and the remarkable concomitant structural breathing. We define this unusual adsorption phenomenon as a cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing mechanism. The overall results suggest that the actual mechanism of selective CO2  adsorption on intermediate&#8208;silica small&#8208;pore zeolites can change from cation gating to cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing to breathing, depending on a combination of their topological and compositional (framework Al content and extraframework cation type and concentration) flexibilities.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;mode Color&#8208;tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Single Component Coordination Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Materials with tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties have wide applications in security signs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encrypting and other fields, which have attracted great attention. However, the majority of reported tunable LPL materials are pure organic molecules or polymers. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic coordination polymers displaying color&#8208;tunable LPL were synthesized by the self&#8208;assembly of HTzPTpy ligand with different cadmium halides (X = Cl, Br, and I). In solid state, their LPL emission colors can be tuned by the time&#8208;evolution, as well as excitation and temperature variation, realizing multi&#8208;mode dynamic color tuning from green to yellow or green to red, and representing the first example in single component coordination polymer materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the modification of LPL is due to the balanced action from single molecule and aggregate triplet excited states aroused by external heavy&#8208;atom effect. The results suggest that the rational introduction of different halide anions into coordination polymers to realize multi&#8208;color LPL is promising for different domain applications, including imaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting and security protection.</dc:description>

      <title>Delivery of a Masked Uranium(II) by an Oxide&#8208;Bridged Diuranium(III) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Oxide is an attractive linker for building polymetallic complexes that provide molecular models for metal oxides activity, but studies of these systems are limited to metals in high oxidation states. Herein, we synthesized and characterized the molecular and electronic structure of diuranium bridged U(III)/U(IV) and U(III)/U(III) complexes. Reactivity studies of these complexes revealed that the U&#8208;O bond is easily broken upon addition of N&#8208;heterocycles resulting in the delivery of a formal equivalent of U(III) and U(II), respectively, along with the uranium(IV) terminal&#8208;oxo coproduct. In particular, the U(III)/U(III) oxide complex effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and two&#8208;electron reduction of 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine affording unique examples of diuranium(III) complexes bridged by N&#8208;heterocyclic redox&#8208;active ligands. These results provide insight into the chemistry of low oxidation state metal oxides and demonstrate the use of oxo&#8208;bridged U(III)/U(III) complexes as a strategy to explore U(II) reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Diarylacetnitrile as a Molecular Probe for the Detection of Polymeric Mechanoradicals in the Bulk State via a Radical Chain&#8208;transfer Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>Since the beginning of the history of polymer science, understanding the influence of mechanical stress on polymer chains has been a fundamental and important research topic. The detection of mechanoradicals generated by homolytic cleavage of the polymer chains in solution has been studied in many cases. However, the detection of mechanoradicals in the bulk is still limited due to their high reactivity. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy to detect mechanoradicals visually and quantitatively using a chain&#8208;transfer agent that generates relatively stable fluorescent radicals as a molecular probe. Mechanoradicals generated by ball milling of polystyrene samples were successfully detected by using diarylacetonitrile as a fluorescent molecular probe via this radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism. This probe enables the visualization and quantitative evaluation of mechanoradicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission.</dc:description>

Among them, double perovskites with Cs  2  AgInCl  6  composition, often doped with various elements, have been under the spotlight for their intriguing optical properties, viz., self&#8208;trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant&#8208;induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards crystals and nanocrystals, also aiming at exploring many alloy compositions with various monovalent and trivalent cations other than Ag  +  and In  3+  . Hence, we offer this perspective on the recent developments on Cs  2  AgInCl  6  bulk crystals and nanocrystals and take a close look at their synthesis strategies, intrinsic optical properties and tunable photoluminescence originating from different alloying and doping effects.

      <title>AIEgen&#8208;Lipid Conjugate for Rapid Labeling of Neutrophils and Monitoring of Their Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>Studies on neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutic engineering have shown great potentials in treating infection and inflammation disorders. Conventional neutrophil labeling methods are time&#8208;consuming and often result in undesired contamination and activation since neutrophils are terminal&#8208;differentiated cells with a half&#8208;life span of only 7 h. A simple, fast and biocompatible strategy to construct engineered neutrophils is highly desirable but remains difficult to achieve. In this study, we present an AIEgen&#8208;lipid conjugate, which can efficiently label harvested neutrophils in 30&#8208;second with no washing step required. This fast labeling method does not affect the activation and transmigration property of neutrophils, which has been successfully used to monitor neutrophil behaviors such as the chemotaxis process and migrating function towards inflammation sites both in vitro and in vivo, offering a tantalizing prospect for neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutics studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Dearomatizing [4+1] Spiroannulation of Naphthols: Discovery of Structurally Non&#8208;Traditional Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Materials</title>
      <dc:description>The development of streamlined synthetic routes to spirofluorene derivatives, in particular those with a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, is an appealing task in the field of organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct [4+1] spiroannulation of ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts to construct spirofluorenyl naphthalenones (SFNP) under mild reaction conditions. This spiroannulation not only directly transforms the hydroxyl group into the carbonyl group, but also tolerates reactive functional groups such as the halo groups, which provide an opportunity to rapidly assemble structurally non&#8208;traditional thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials that feature a carbonyl group with an adjacent spirofluorenyl unit as the acceptor. As an illustrated example, the OLED device utilizing the assembled  DMAC&#8208;SFNP  as the host material exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5 V and an ultra&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 32.2%. This work not only gives us an inspiration for designing structurally non&#8208;traditional TADF materials, but also displays the charm of C&#8722;H activation as a revolutionary synthetic strategy in the innovation of optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of streamlined synthetic routes to spirofluorene derivatives, in particular those with a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, is an appealing task in the field of organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct [4+1] spiroannulation of ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts to construct spirofluorenyl naphthalenones (SFNP) under mild reaction conditions. This spiroannulation not only directly transforms the hydroxyl group into the carbonyl group, but also tolerates reactive functional groups such as the halo groups, which provide an opportunity to rapidly assemble structurally non&#8208;traditional thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials that feature a carbonyl group with an adjacent spirofluorenyl unit as the acceptor. As an illustrated example, the OLED device utilizing the assembled  DMAC&#8208;SFNP  as the host material exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5 V and an ultra&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 32.2%. This work not only gives us an inspiration for designing structurally non&#8208;traditional TADF materials, but also displays the charm of C&#8722;H activation as a revolutionary synthetic strategy in the innovation of optoelectronic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Quantitative Imaging of Native Microbiota Distribution in the Gut</title>
      <dc:description>Due to the challenges to acquire detailed spatial information of gut bacteria in situ, microbiota&#8217;s three&#8208;dimensional (3D) distributions in the gut remain largely uncharted. Here, we propose a tissue clearing&#8208;based and D&#8208;amino acid labeling&#8208;facilitated (TiDaL) strategy that combines a novel microbiota in vivo labeling protocol, CUBIC&#8208;based tissue clearing and whole&#8208;mount tissue imaging, to achieve 3D imaging of indigenous gut microbiota. We demonstrate high resolution 3D acquisition of their biogeography in different gut sections, and present quantitative spatial details in relation to the host epithelium. We unexpectedly observe microbiota in the small intestine crypts which were thought to be bacteria&#8208;free. Moreover, significant bacterial overgrowth in the first two&#8208;thirds of the small intestine is detected in an enteritis model. We expect that this quantitative 3D imaging strategy for native gut microbiota will provide insightful information into the host&#8208;microbiota interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Cerium vanadate nanozyme with specific superoxide dismutase activity regulates mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis in neuronal cells</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoparticles that functionally mimic the activity of metal&#8208;containing enzymes (metallonanozymes) are of therapeutic importance to treat various diseases. However, it is still not clear whether such nanozymes can completely substitute the function of natural enzymes in living cells. In this work, we show for the first time that a cerium vanadate (CeVO  4  ) nanozyme can substitute the function of superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) in the neuronal cells even when the natural enzyme is down&#8208;regulated by specific gene silencing. The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial damage in SOD1 and SOD2&#8208;depleted cells by regulating the superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins. Further, the nanozyme effectively prevents the mitochondrial depolarization, leading to a significant improvement in the cellular levels of ATP under oxidative stress.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Low Cost Industrial Organic Pigment Coating</title>
      <dc:description>Surface passivation of perovskite thin films has been established as a promising approach to improving both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). While remarkable progress has been achieved with various surface passivating agents, long&#8208;term stability of PSCs has not been fully addressed. Here, we report a new strategy for surface passivation of PSCs using a low cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA). The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl)&#8208;quinacridone (TBOC&#8208;QA), followed by facile thermal annealing to convert TBOC&#8208;QA to insoluble QA. With the halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead Iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9% recorded for the unmodified devices. Density functional theory calculations revealed strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, which effectively reduced the surface defects of halide perovskite thin films and suppressed the nonradiative recombination. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to remarkably enhanced contact angle from 35.6&#8304; for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2&#8304; for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. As a result, the stabilities of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were greatly enhanced, retaining about 90 % of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000 hours storage under ambient conditions. The universality of this passivation strategy was evaluated by extending MAPbI3 systems to triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite systems, which further confirm the effectiveness of industrial pigment passivation of PSCs with enhanced efficiency and stability.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ assembly of choline acetyltransferase ligands by a hydrothiolation reaction reveals key determinants for inhibitor design</title>
      <dc:description>The potential drug target choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) catalyzes the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons, T&#8208;cells, and B&#8208;cells. Herein, we show that arylvinylpyridiniums (AVPs), the most widely studied class of ChAT inhibitors, act as substrate in an unusual coenzyme A&#8208;dependent hydrothiolation reaction. This&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;synthesis yields an adduct that is the actual enzyme inhibitor. The adduct is deeply buried in the active site tunnel of ChAT and interactions with a hydrophobic pocket near the choline binding site have major implications for the molecular recognition of inhibitors. Our findings clarify the inhibition mechanism of AVPs, establish a drug modality that exploits a target&#8208;catalysed reaction between exogenous and endogenous precursors, and provide new directions for the development of ChAT inhibitors with improved potency and bioactivity.</dc:description>

The adduct is deeply buried in the active site tunnel of ChAT and interactions with a hydrophobic pocket near the choline binding site have major implications for the molecular recognition of inhibitors. Our findings clarify the inhibition mechanism of AVPs, establish a drug modality that exploits a target&#8208;catalysed reaction between exogenous and endogenous precursors, and provide new directions for the development of ChAT inhibitors with improved potency and bioactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Isomerization Reactions in Anionic Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Borates and Control of Properties and Reactivities in the resulting CoII Complexes through Agostic Interactions</title>

Strong agostic interactions with the &#8222;C&#8208;H&#8220;&#8208;groups of the cyclohexyl substituents result in an unusual low spin square planar Co  II  complex, which is unreactive towards external substrates. Such agostic interactions are absent in the complex with phenyl substituents on the borate backbone. That complex displays a high spin tetrahedral Co  II  center, which is reactive towards external substrates including dioxygen. A combined synthetic, crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical approach is used to investigate the compounds. We conclusively show here that the structure and properties of these Co  II  complexes can be strongly influenced through interactions in the secondary coordination sphere. Additionally, we unravel a unique ligand rearrangement for these classes of anionic mesoionic carbene based ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>The Triplet Hydroxyl Radical Complex of Phosphorus Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
A triplet radical&#8208;radical complex consisting of a hydroxyl radical and phosphorus monoxide (.OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP.), which serves as an important intermediate in the combustion of phosphines, has been captured in solid Ar&#8208;matrices at 2.8&#8197;K. Its interconversion with metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) has also been observed.







Abstract
Phosphorus monoxide (.PO) is a key intermediate in phosphorus chemistry, and its association with the hydroxyl radical (.OH) to yield metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) contributes to the chemiluminescence in the combustion of phosphines. When photolyzing cis&#8208;HOPO in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 2.8&#8197;K, the simplest dioxophosphorane HPO2 and an elusive hydroxyl radical complex (HRC) of .PO form. This prototypical radical&#8208;radical complex reforms into cis&#8208;HOPO at above 12.0&#8197;K by overcoming a barrier of 0.28&#177;0.02&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The vibrational spectra of this HRC and its D&#8208; and 18O&#8208;isotopologues suggest a structure of .OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP., for which a triplet spin multiplicity with a binding energy of &#8722;3.20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 has been computed at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level.

     alt="The Triplet Hydroxyl Radical Complex of Phosphorus Monoxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A triplet radical&#8208;radical complex consisting of a hydroxyl radical and phosphorus monoxide (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;), which serves as an important intermediate in the combustion of phosphines, has been captured in solid Ar&#8208;matrices at 2.8&#8197;K. Its interconversion with metaphosphorous acid (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;HOPO) has also been observed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphorus monoxide (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;PO) is a key intermediate in phosphorus chemistry, and its association with the hydroxyl radical (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH) to yield metaphosphorous acid (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;HOPO) contributes to the chemiluminescence in the combustion of phosphines. When photolyzing &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;HOPO in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 2.8&#8197;K, the simplest dioxophosphorane HPO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and an elusive hydroxyl radical complex (HRC) of &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;PO form. This prototypical radical&#8208;radical complex reforms into &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;HOPO at above 12.0&#8197;K by overcoming a barrier of 0.28&#177;0.02&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The vibrational spectra of this HRC and its D&#8208; and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8208;isotopologues suggest a structure of &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;, for which a triplet spin multiplicity with a binding energy of &#8722;3.20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; has been computed at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization Polycondensation for the Synthesis of Aromatic Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;catalyzed polymerization reactions&#160;enable the synthesis of novel aromatic polymers.&#160;In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011426), J.&#8197;D. Azoulay et&#8197;al. demonstrate how the multifaceted reactivity of cationic gold promotes direct C&#8722;H functionalization polycondensations&#160;between alkyne&#8208;containing comonomers and the C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of diverse heteroarenes. The high reactivities and exceptional degrees of polymerization afford a valuable approach to polymerize a veritable treasure trove of otherwise unreactive monomers.
