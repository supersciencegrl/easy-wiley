         <title>Preferential Texture of Surface Coating on Zn Anodes for Advanced Aqueous Batteries: Small Change but Big Gain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZIF&#8208;8 is proposed as a model to elucidate the effect of the crystal orientation of surface coatings on Zn foils on electrochemical performance. The preferential orientation of ZIF&#8208;8(200) reduces the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reactivity, blocks the deleterious species, and improves the interface stability, promoting the electrochemical performance of Zn foils.








Abstract
Zinc metal, as the mainstream anode material of aqueous batteries, faces severe side reactions and notorious dendrite growth. Surface passivation of Zn anodes with a protective layer is one of the effective strategies to address these issues. The previous reports have focused on applying different components as surface layers while neglecting the impact of their crystallographic orientation on electrochemical performance. Here, a ZIF&#8208;8 layer is prepared as a model to elucidate this effect on the Zn anode. DFT calculations indicate that ZIF&#8208;8(200), compared to ZIF&#8208;8(110) and ZIF&#8208;8(211), exhibits a lower d&#8208;band center, a smaller difference in d&#8208;p band centers, and a weaker H2O adsorption, thereby inhibiting hydrogen evolution as confirmed by experimental results. Meanwhile, ZIF&#8208;8(200) also increases the interfacial interaction between ZIF&#8208;8 and Zn, enhances the mechanical properties, and suppresses the dendrite growth. The small pores of ZIF&#8208;8 restrict the migration of SO42&#713;, I3&#713;, and VO2+, thus enabling the selective transport of Zn2+. Thus, the preferential orientation of ZIF&#8208;8(200) significantly improves the electrochemical performance of the Zn anodes. These results demonstrate a new way to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anodes through crystal engineering of surface layers.

         <title>P450 Enzyme LyoI Performs Hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bifuran Oxidation in the Polyether Ionophore Lysocellin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a study of the biosynthesis of the polyether ionophore lysocellin, the P450 enzyme LyoI was found to catalyze a rare oxidation of a hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran moiety to its hemiketal form. The oxidation was identified as the key for unlocking the bioactivity of lysocellin. The sequence of LyoI lacks a key acidic residue, essential for its oxidative capabilities, which was utilized to identify a range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes.








Abstract
Polyether ionophores are potent antimicrobials, albeit also cytotoxic against mammalian cells. We have identified several polyether ionophores containing a common hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol (hemiketal) moiety, which cannot be derived from the canonical biosynthetic steps observed for the compound class, suggesting an unusual oxidative transformation. To identify the responsible enzyme, we applied CRISPR&#8211;BEST to knock out genes in the lysocellin&#8208;producing strain S. longwoodensis. This allowed us to propose the first annotation of the lysocellin biosynthetic gene cluster and identify the responsible P450 enzyme, LyoI, through reconstitution of the function in vivo. LyoI knockout provided access to the non&#8208;oxidized precursor (pre&#8208;lysocellin) which allowed both in vitro validation of the unusual direct hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran to hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol oxidation and investigation of the impact on biological activity. Interestingly, absence of the LyoI&#8208;mediated oxidation greatly reduced the biological potency of the compound. Closer investigation of the sequence revealed that LyoI lacks a key conserved acidic residue, which proved essential for the unusual oxidative function of the enzyme. Through a sequence similarity network of LyoI, we were able to identify a wide range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes, highlighting the possibilities of a biosynthesis&#8208;focused approach to discovering novel enzymes.

         <title>Enhancement of Emission Efficiency and Color Tuning by Mixing Platinum(II) and Palladium(II) Complexes in a One&#8208;dimensional Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mixing isomorphous Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes, which have very low emission efficiencies at room temperature, in pure crystals, a series of mixed crystals with high emission efficiencies and luminescent colors depending on the mixing ratio were successfully constructed. The characteristic luminescence of the mixed crystals originates from excited oligomers with different Pt/Pd ratios.








Abstract
A series of mixed metal crystals comprising square&#8208;planar platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes, K[M(CN)2(dFppy)]&#183;H2O (M&#160;=&#160;Pt2+, Pd2+; dFppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridinate), were prepared, and their unique luminescence properties&#8212;emerging upon mixing&#8212;were revealed. Seven mixed crystals with Pt/Pd ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:4.5, 1:10, and 1:13 adopt the same crystal structure (P21/c) as the pure metal complexes, in which the metal complexes are stacked with short M&#8943;M contacts (3.35&#8211;3.37&#160;&#197; at 293&#160;K). Reflecting the M&#8943;M interactions, the mixed crystals exhibited luminescence attributable to the emission from the triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) state. The emission color varied with the Pt/Pd mixing ratio, and notably, a significant enhancement in emission quantum yield was observed (e.g., &#934;&#160;=&#160;0.64 for the Pt/Pd&#160;=&#160;1:2 crystal at room temperature). The emission efficiency further improved at temperatures above room temperature. These unprecedented emission properties are explained by energy transfer among multiple emission sites within the one&#8208;dimensional chain, involving excited oligomers containing various combinations of Pt and Pd complexes. Thus, metal mixing offers a new strategy for enhancing emission efficiency and enabling color tuning.

         <title>Exercise Modulates Exocytosis: Chemical Insights from the Intracellular Vesicle Perspective</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides fundamental chemical insights from the intracellular vesicle perspective into how exercise improves vesicle secretory function, suggests that exercise enhances neurotransmitter storage and release by upregulating exocytosis&#8208;associated proteins (i.e., F&#8208;actin, myosin II, VAMP, SNAP&#8208;25, and Munc&#8208;18) and increasing calcium influx.








Abstract
The systemic benefits of exercise are partially attributed to exerkines release via extracellular vesicles, prompting extensive research on the effects of exercise on these vesicles. However, whether and how exercise modulates intracellular vesicle chemistry (e.g., neurotransmitter storage and exocytotic dynamics) remains unclear. Clarifying these mechanisms is essential to understanding how exercise influences exocytosis&#8208;associated physiological and pathological processes. In this study, by using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we reveal that exercise modulates intracellular vesicle chemistry by enhancing the neurotransmitter storage capacity, increasing the neurotransmitter release, and shortening the exocytosis events, while slightly reducing the fraction of release. Mechanistic studies suggest that these changes are likely due to the upregulation of certain exocytosis&#8208;associated proteins (i.e., F&#8208;actin, myosin II, vesicle&#8208;associated membrane protein, synaptosomal&#8208;associated protein 25, and mammalian uncoordinated&#8208;18) and the increase in the calcium influx. These findings provide valuable chemical insights into the beneficial effects of exercise from the intracellular vesicle perspective.

Bio&#8208;inspired proton transport regulation via 5&#8208;fluorouracil tautomerism within sulfonated MOF&#8208;808 to reconcile the inherent trade&#8208;off between low activation energy and sustained proton mobility








Abstract
The strategic modulation of proton transport kinetics and precise control of migration energy barriers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are essential for developing next&#8208;generation proton conductors. Inspired by biological proton channels, this study introduces a dynamic regulation strategy by keto&#8208;enol tautomerism to reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between low activation energy (Ea) and sustained proton mobility. We successfully construct a hierarchical proton conductive system (denoted as FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H) by integrating 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) molecules into sulfonic&#8208;functionalized MOF&#8208;808 through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification. The enol tautomer of 5&#8208;FU reconfigures hydrogen&#8208;bond networks under humidity variations, synergizing with anchored &#9472;SO3H groups to establish proton transport pathways along ordered ionic channels (&#9472;SO3H&#183;&#183;&#183;H2O&#183;&#183;&#183;5&#8208;FU) and tautomerism&#8208;driven delocalization via reversible keto&#8208;enol isomerization. The optimized compound FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H exhibits a high proton conductivity of 7.15&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and 95% RH, representing an approximate 300&#8208;fold enhancement over pristine MOF&#8208;808, a 15&#8208;fold improvement versus the 5&#8208;FU&#8208;encapsulated analogue FU@MOF&#8208;808, and the sulfonated framework MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate an ultra&#8208;low formation energy barrier (9.05 and 1.59&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1) from keto to enol conversion, attributed to sulfonic acid stabilization of protonated transition states. Furthermore, the proton conductive mechanism is visually corroborated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, suggesting Grotthuss&#8208;dominated proton migration within hydrated nanochannels, aligning with experimental results.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Assembly of a Nested Gd20@Gd32 @Ni36 Cluster via Urea Controlled Carbonate Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nested three&#8208;shell cluster Gd52Ni36 featuring a carbonate&#8208;templated dodecahedral Gd20 core was synthesized via a urea&#8208;mediated slow&#8208;release strategy. The mechanism of cluster formation was studied and the synthesis was optimized through a machine learning&#8211;guided high&#8208;throughput screening of 780 reaction conditions.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based polyhedral clusters are of great interest due to their unique geometries and functional properties, but their controlled synthesis remains a major challenge. Here, we report a nested three&#8208;shell cluster, [Gd52Ni36(MeIDA)36(OH)114(CO3)12 (H2O)48]&#183;(ClO4)18&#183;(H2O)21 (Gd52Ni36, H2MeIDA = N&#8208;Methyliminodiacetic acid), achieved by using urea as a slow&#8208;release carbonate source to direct the formation of a dodecahedral inner shell. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a unique Gd20@Gd32@Ni36 arrangement, with the innermost Gd20 forming a Platonic dodecahedron templated by carbonate. A machine learning&#8211;guided, high&#8208;throughput synthesis platform enabled the exploration of 780 reaction conditions, uncovering key parameters and phase boundaries governing cluster formation. This work demonstrates data&#8208;driven strategies can accelerate the discovery of complex lanthanide architectures.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Induced Hydrogen Bonding Supramolecular Network for Ultra&#8208;Stable Ammonium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitro&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic framework (HATNTN) is developed for NH4+ ions storage. It forms dynamic hydrogen bonding supramolecular networks to stabilize organic molecules. A two&#8208;step coordination process enables outstanding NH4+ storage, making HATNTN a promising organic anode for aqueous ammonium ion batteries, offering high capacity of 203.4 mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and long stability over 30,000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AAIBs) are emerging as sustainable energy storage systems due to their inherent safety and eco&#8208;friendliness. Organic electrode materials demonstrate significant potential as anode materials due to their structural diversity, eco&#8208;friendly, and abundant redox&#8208;active moieties. However, their practical application is hindered by low specific capacity and poor cycling stability. In this study, we introduced 2,8,14&#8208;trinitrodiquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (HATNTN), a nitro&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic structure, as a host material for enhancing NH4+ storage. The synergistic integration of nitro groups and aromatic frameworks enables dual enhancements: robust NH4+ coordination via a two&#8208;step redox mechanism and enhanced dissolution resistance via hydrogen&#8208;bonding supramolecular network. HATNTN anode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 203.4 mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and an exceptional cycle life of 30,000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, HATNTN//VO300 full battery delivers a stable specific capacity of 106.2 mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 30,000 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1, with a cycle life exceeding 2500 h and a capacity retention rate of 88.1%. Combining in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we elucidate the critical role of nitro&#8208;induced hydrogen bonding in stabilizing NH4+ storage interfaces. This study establishes a supramolecular design paradigm for durable organic anodes, advancing high&#8208;performance AAIBs toward practical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Conversion of Methane to C2+ Hydrocarbons and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable CH4 conversion in a solid oxide steam electrolyzer is proposed to produce C2+ hydrocarbons and hydrogen synchronously, and the electro&#8208;spillover oxygen modulated surface C&#9472;H cleavage followed by the gaseous &#183;CH3 radical coupling mechanism is elucidated. 








Abstract
Catalytic methane (CH4) upgrading to C2+ products has attracted widespread interest. However, non&#8208;oxidative coupling and oxidative coupling of CH4 are limited by coking and over&#8208;oxidation, respectively. In this work, we propose an efficient and stable CH4 conversion system in a solid oxide steam electrolyzer, enabling the simultaneous production of C2+ hydrocarbons and H2. Furthermore, through various in situ characterizations, we reveal a gaseous &#183;CH3 radical coupling mechanism underlying the electrochemical CH4 conversion. These findings pave the way for the efficient design of the electrode for anodic CH4 coupling reactions in a solid oxide electrolyzer and establish a new framework for atom&#8208;efficient strategies for CH4 upgrading.

         <title>Regiodivergent Ligand&#8208;Controlled Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydroxymethylation of Alkynes with Aqueous Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent water&#8208;tolerant reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has been developed via synergistic visible light organophotoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. The reaction produced valuable linear and branched allylic alcohols with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by choosing of suitable ligand under otherwise the same reaction conditions.








Abstract
Allylic alcohols are versatile and essential building blocks in synthetic chemistry, widely used for the preparation of complex molecules, pharmaceuticals, and materials. We report here a regiodivergent reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde to prepare allylic alcohols enabled by visible light photoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. Using readily available, bulk, and cheap aqueous formaldehyde as a simple C1 source, this method allows for the selective production of both linear and branched allylic alcohols in one&#8208;step manner. The excellent regioselectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled by adjusting the electronic and steric properties of the ligands. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by careful selection of ligands. Mechanistic studies reveal a pathway involving ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and formaldehyde, followed by a protonolysis process, offering new insights into the catalyst design and reaction mechanism.

         <title>Adjusting Chemical Hardness&#8211;Softness Balance of Electrolyte to Enable High&#8208;Voltage Reversible Fluoride Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte system based on tetrabutylammonium fluoride salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid solvent is designed based on anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base balance modulation. The soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively expanding the electrochemical window and cycling life of fluoride ion batteries based on Cu2O cathode.








Abstract
Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs), as a promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage technology, have attracted significant attention. However, developing an ideal fluoride&#8208;ion electrolyte that suppresses the &#946;&#8208;H abstraction (caused by strong Lewis&#8208;basicity F&#8722;) and electrolyte decomposition remains challenging. To address this bottleneck, we design an electrolyte system based on commercial tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF4) ionic liquid solvent through anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base (HSAB) balance modulation, unveiling its multiscale mechanisms for mitigating interfacial parasitic reaction and enhancing metal anode stability. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively blocking the &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway and expanding the electrochemical window to 4.5&#160;V. The ionic conductivity of this ionic liquid based electrolyte reaches 5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C even after in situ polymerization. The Cu2O cathode coupling insertion and conversion reactions can alleviate the volume deformation and capacity decay of Cu2O||Li&#8211;LiF high&#8208;voltage FIBs, with a high resting voltage (2.91&#160;V) and a high initial capacity of 589.9&#160;mAh g&#8722;1. The Cu2O||Pb&#8211;PbF2 FIBs maintain a high reversible capacity of 243.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 even after 800 cycles under 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. The work establishes a novel electrolyte design paradigm for high&#8208;voltage reversible FIBs.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Functionalization Enabled by Donor&#8211;Acceptor Microporous Polymer Aerogels Featuring Ultralong&#8208;Lived and Long&#8208;Range Excitons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the construction of conjugated microporous polymer aerogels featuring ultralong&#8208;lived excitons, high&#8208;concentration local catalytic centers, and a hierarchically porous gel network that wraps solvent and reactants to provide a &#8220;single&#8221; reaction phase without interfacial resistance. The aerogels as quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalysts show general applicability to four C&#9472;H functionalization reactions, achieving remarkable conversion efficiencies, gram&#8208;scale productivities, and recyclability.








Abstract
Simultaneous promotion of charge and mass transportation between catalytic centers and reactants is crucial for photocatalysis but remains a substantial challenge on account of the widespread use of homogeneous or heterogeneous photocatalysts that suffer from sluggish reactant&#8208;diffusion kinetics or interfacial electron&#8208;transport resistance, respectively. Herein, we demonstrate the construction of conjugated microporous polymer aerogels as available quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalysts by integrating structural designability, which allows for the incorporation of electron&#8208;acceptor building blocks featuring ultralong&#8208;lived excitons as high&#8208;concentration local catalytic centers, and hierarchically porous gel networks that wrap solvent and reactants to provide a &#8220;single&#8221; reaction phase without interfacial resistance. A total of 18 samples of C&#9472;H functionalization reactions underpinned by four different mechanisms were screened to showcase the general applicability of the obtained aerogel photocatalysts, which achieved remarkable conversion efficiencies, gram&#8208;scale productivities, and recyclability. By combining a designable structure for photophysical properties with hierarchical porosities for optimal charge/mass transfer, we believe microporous polymer aerogels can serve as a versatile design platform for quasi&#8208;homogeneously photocatalyzing challenging reactions.

         <title>TASK2&#8208;Inspired pH&#8208;Gating Polymeric Nanochannels with Multiple Interconvertible Permeability States by Synergistic Regulation of Conformation and Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic precise permeation regulation of biological ion channels, an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy is provided to build smart polymeric nanochannels with four ion permeability states in response to pH stimuli. Beneficial for synergy transformation of structure and charge properties, the nanochannels achieve pH&#8208;gating on&#8211;off switch of fast cation flux, superhigh cation/anion selectivity, and salinity&#8208;gradient energy transduction, respectively. 








Abstract
Biological ion channels can regulate finely the ion transmembrane permeation, with superhigh ion selectivity and on&#8211;off ion flux in response to external stimuli, for signal transduction and energy conversion. However, fabricating smart artificial nanochannels with analogous functions remain challenging by single design of structure or charge property. In vivo, function basis of pH&#8208;gated TWIK&#8208;related acid&#8208;sensitive K+ channel 2 (TASK2) channels is attributed to synergy control of geometrical conformation and surface potential for filter gates. With this inspiration, we report an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy to construct biomimetic responsive nanochannels, based on dye&#8208;loading branched poly(piperidine)s. Two nanochannel models, negatively&#8208;charged large pores (0.76&#160;nm) and positively&#8208;charged small pores (0.49&#160;nm), can be switched quickly by external pH stimuli, due to protonation/deprotonation and conformation change of gates. Thereby, symmetric and asymmetric pH stimuli at the two sides of nanochannels achieve four distinct permeability states to various ions, respectively, to mimic inactivated, inhibited, rest, and activated states of TASK2 channels. Applying for salinity&#8208;gradient energy conversion, the high&#8208;selectivity/high&#8208;flux states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;3332) and low&#8208;selectivity and low&#8208;flux permeability states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;0.33) act as an on&#8211;off switch of salinity&#8208;gradient energy nanogenerator, with superhigh energy conversion efficiency of &#8764;50%. This work suggests the potential of extrinsic&#8208;gate composite nanochannels for in vitro biomimetic applications.

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Reduction of Non&#8208;Neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet constructed from an asymmetric tridentate ligand structure was designed for the photoreduction of CO2 to syngas under different contents of CO2 and natural sunlight. The carboxyl group in the asymmetric tridentate ligand structure facilitated dissociation of water to generate *H by hydrogen bond. Moreover, *H assists CO2 (g) adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2 where CO2 enrichment and purification is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2.

&lt;p&gt;A metal-covalent organic framework nanosheet constructed from an asymmetric tridentate ligand structure was designed for the photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to syngas under different contents of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and natural sunlight. The carboxyl group in the asymmetric tridentate ligand structure facilitated dissociation of water to generate *H by hydrogen bond. Moreover, *H assists CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment and purification is an energy-intensive process. Herein, we report a Co-COOH-COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co&lt;sub&gt;17.7&lt;/sub&gt;-COOH-COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from neat CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 180.5&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from 40 vol% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under visible light, while it is up to 112.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from neat CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 116.0&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from 40 vol% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [4+2]/Cheletropic Retro&#8208;[4+1] Cycloadditions of Thiophene S,S&#8208;Dioxides with 3&#8208;Substituted Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric IEDDA/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions, using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides (TDOs) and 3&#8208;substituted indoles as reaction partners, are realized by a chiral Fe(III)/BOX complex. A series of cyclohexa&#8208;fused tricyclic indolines bearing a bridgehead quaternary stereogenic center are synthesized in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by the concise total synthesis of pentacyclic Strychnos indole alkaloid (+)&#8208;geissoschizoline.








Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides are a prominent method for synthesizing unsaturated six&#8208;membered carbocycles. However, to the best of our knowledge, catalytic asymmetric variations of these reactions have not yet been achieved. Herein, we report Fe(III)&#8208;bis(oxazoline) complex&#8208;catalyzed inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand [4+2] cycloaddition/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] extrusion of SO2 reactions between thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides and 3&#8208;substituted indoles. The key to the success of this transformation involves using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxide components bearing an N&#8208;acyloxazolidinone group at the C2 position, which coordinates with the chiral catalyst, and a halide group at the C5 position to prevent the self&#8208;dimerization of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. Computational studies revealed that the [4+2] cycloaddition proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, with the subsequent retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition acting as a driving force to facilitate the initial [4+2] cycloaddition. This [4+2]/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition reaction sequence enables the synthesis of a broad range of hexahydrocarbazoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center, which are core structures in numerous families of indole alkaloids, in good yields with high enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated through diverse product transformations and a concise, enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;geissoschizoline.

         <title>Optoregulated mRNA Delivery Controls Pleiotropic Immune Signaling for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced transfection system (LITS) was designed to precisely control the delivery of mRNA, achieving spatiotemporal de&#8208;coupling of the pleotropic inflammatory and tolerogenic signals of interleukin&#8208;2 to conduct safe eradication of tumors.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of protein expression remains a critical challenge in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics, particularly for tumor&#8208;targeted therapy. Here, we introduce a Light&#8208;Induced Transfection System (LITS) leveraging photosensitizing polymers to deliver mRNA systemically and activate its translation via light&#8208;triggered endosomal escape. This system enables localized protein expression in any irradiated tissue, allowing for spatial control of therapeutic effects. Using interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) as a model, we demonstrate that LITS can trigger proinflammatory cytokine levels in irradiated tumors, while inducing tolerogenic IL&#8208;2 levels in nonirradiated healthy tissues. This modulation of IL&#8208;2&#8242;s pleiotropic effects provides both potent antitumor activity and reduced toxicity. Furthermore, by optimizing light exposure, LITS synergizes IL&#8208;2 efficacy by driving immunogenic cell death to eradicate lung metastasis in a breast cancer model. Our findings establish LITS as a programmable mRNA delivery platform for on&#8208;demand targeted and safe therapies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the Ru 4d and the C&#8801;N 2p induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and further modulates the d&#8208;electron structure of V/Fe, enabling the cooperative V3+/V4+, Ru(2x&#8208;&#948;)+/Ru2x+, and Fe2+/Fe3+ multi&#8208;redox reactions.








Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage offers grid&#8208;scale energy storage system with long lifespan, great safety, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, preparing proton storage materials with balanced conductivity, activity, and stability remains challenging due to suboptimal structure design. Herein, we report atomic&#8208;level engineering of d&#8208;p orbital hybridization strategy to regulate transition metal (V/Fe) d&#8208;band centers. Vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF)/RuOx quantum dots (RuOxQDs) heterostructure (VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs) was synthesized via in situ co&#8208;precipitation. The d&#8208;p hybridization of Ru's 4d orbital with VHCF's C&#8801;N 2p orbital (cyano) induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and creates &#8220;electronic highways&#8221; for regulating the d&#8208;electrons of V/Fe, shifting their d&#8208;band centers to achieve continuous multi&#8208;electron transfer. Moreover, optimizing the d&#8208;electron structure reduces the V5+ ratio and thus decreases vanadium dissolution during cycling. The VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs cathode delivers a large capacity of 162&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability (127&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 40&#160;A g&#8722;1), and ultralong stability over 10&#160;000 cycles. When paired with MoO3&#8211;MXene anode, the asymmetric full device achieves a high energy density of 53&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1.3&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. The atomic&#8208;level orbital hybridization regulation of d&#8208;electron structure provides a new direction for high&#8208;performance proton storage.

         <title>Rational Design of an Organotellurium Chalcogen Bonding Catalyst for Azetidine Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of bidentate organotellurium dication catalysts are rationally designed to strengthen the weak chalcogen bonding interactions. The enhanced reactivity enables the first catalytic application of chalcogen bonding in the activation of azetidines via a bidentate activation mode, thereby initiating [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions with non&#8208;activated alkenes and alkynes to access various piperidine and tetrahydropyridine architectures.








Abstract
The application of chalcogen bonding catalysis has been largely confined to benchmark reactions due to the limited structural diversity and activating ability of the catalysts, especially those derived from tellurium. Herein, we present a group of rationally designed bis&#8208;telluronium catalysts and realize the first application of chalcogen bonding donor in catalyzing the [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction between azetidines and non&#8208;activated alkenes or alkynes. This chemistry demonstrates excellent functional group tolerance and offers an efficient avenue to access the piperidine and tetrahydropyridine architectures in generally moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good efficiency. A wide array of mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations have been performed to verify the high activity of the organotellurium catalysts with strong electron&#8208;deficient aromatic substituents and to suggest a novel bidentate activation mode between catalyst and azetidine via Te&#8943;O interaction.

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type Photophysics of Rotational Isomers in a Diphenylanthracene Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To fully grasp the genuine photophysical landscape of organic molecules, we must consider conformational isomerism arising from structural flexibility. Or else, this may mislead diverse mixtures of conformers to be assigned as a single ensemble. This work demonstrates Janus&#8208;type photophysics of rotamers in a diphenylanthracene dimer, highlighting different types of exciton coupling, charge transfer characteristics, and triplet formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Organic molecular dimers serve as valuable model systems for manipulating and exploring interchromophore interactions. However, the structural flexibility introduced by linker or chromophore rotation gives rise to conformational isomers with distinct atomic arrangements, complicating the interpretation of photophysical processes. In this study, we investigate 9,9&#8242;,10,10&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bianthracene (TPBA) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA. To address the &#8220;Janus&#8208;type&#8221; photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment&#8208;dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in&#8208;depth study of the Janus&#8208;like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.

         <title>Selective Chemo&#8208;Divergent Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate Enabled by Multi&#8208;Functional Poly(Ionic Liquids)&#8208;Stabilized Ru Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and selective chemo&#8208;divergent hydrogenation of cyclic carbonates is promoted by in situ generated poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;stabilized ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru@PIL) catalysts. Under solvent&#8208;free conditions, ethylene carbonate is transformed into either ethylene glycol and CH4 or EtOH and CO2, following a &#8220;direct hydrogenation&#8221; or a &#8220;hydrogenative decarboxylation&#8221; pathway, respectively.








Abstract
Cyclic carbonates, in particular ethylene carbonate (EC), are pivotal compounds across chemical sciences because of their unique properties. Although, their transformation into valuable products has attracted great attention, efficient and selective transformations remain challenging. In this work, we report a catalytic system composed of Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) stabilized by poly(ionic liquids) (Ru@PIL), that enables the selective chemo&#8208;divergent hydrogenation of EC into either EtOH and CO2 or EG and CH4, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. Those transformations relied on the multi&#8208;task ability of poly(ionic liquids) (PILs), which provides efficient electro&#8208;steric protection of the NPs, good solubility in neat carbonates, and organocatalytic activity depending on the nature of the PIL counter&#8208;anions. Hence, PIL incorporating nucleophilic anions, such as I&#8722;, triggers the cascade transformation of EC into EtOH via a sequential decarboxylation&#8208;hydrogenation process. Conversely, in the presence of non&#8208;nucleophilic anions, the PIL is catalytically a spectator, yielding to the &#8220;direct hydrogenation&#8221; of EC by the RuNPs.

         <title>Doping Bulky Fluorinated Organic Anion to Construct Highly Efficient Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Type Photosensitizers for Cancer Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to enhance the fluorescence intensity and to modulate cellular uptake of anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIE PSs by doping bulky fluorinated anions tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (FTB) into nanoparticles was proposed. The optimized DF&#8208;FTB8 (FTB:DPBCF&#8208;Br&#160;=&#160;8:1) exhibited superior cellular uptake, outstanding imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation level, enabling efficient cancer photodynamic therapy. 








Abstract
Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature have demonstrated promising potential in photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer. However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the &#960;+ core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF&#8208;Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 to obtain NPs (named DF&#8208;TBX or DF&#8208;FTBX, X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF&#8208;Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X&#160;=&#160;8 in DF&#8208;TB8 and DF&#8208;FTB8, resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF&#8208;FTB8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers.

Ultimately, DF-FTB&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion-&#960;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; type photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Ni Single Atoms Toward Efficient Urea Photosynthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urchin&#8208;like Ni1/TiO2&#8208;x catalyst with atomically dispersed Ni and Ov dual sites enables efficient urea synthesis by synergistically activating N2 and CO2. The Ni sites facilitate N2 adsorption, while Ov activates CO2. The CO2 reduction product (i.e., CO) can migrate to Ni sites, coupling with *N2 to form *NCON*, converting to urea. This dual&#8208;site mechanism lowers barriers and boosts kinetics, offering a green urea synthesis route.








Abstract
The direct photochemical synthesis of urea under mild conditions presents considerable promise. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic urea synthesis is severely restricted by the co&#8208;adsorption and activation of inert CO2 and N2 molecules. Herein, an ingenious design of a high&#8208;performance Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst by strategically coupling Ni single atoms (Ni SAs) and oxygen vacancies (Ov) onto urchin&#8208;like TiO2 architecture. By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73&#160;&#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1h&#8722;1. Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N2 adsorption and activation, generating *N2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N2 to form a &#8220;tower&#8208;like&#8221; urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual&#8208;active&#8208;site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high&#8208;value products.

         <title>Tailoring Tubular Supramolecular Polymers with Polar Lumens to Host Hydrophilic Dye Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique class of tubular polymer structures that are soluble in apolar organic solvents but are endowed with polar pores has been created through the rational design of the monomer units, which self&#8208;assemble in amphiphilic cyclic entities that then stack into tubular architectures. These tailored assemblies are able to selectively host hydrophilic dye molecules that are complementary in size and chemical affinity for the pore coating, providing containers for the study of energy transfer processes.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are living an intense research period in which new synthetic strategies, unusual morphologies, and diverse promising applications are being explored. We contribute here to this field with the development of a unique class of supramolecular polymers that are able to selectively encapsulate guest molecules within their lumen. This is achieved through a rational design of the monomer units, which self&#8208;assemble in amphiphilic cyclic entities that then stack into lipophilic tubular architectures that contain a polar pore. These tailored assemblies are able to host hydrophilic dye molecules that are complementary in size and chemical affinity for the pore coating. Dye extraction is characterized by: (1) the emergence of the dye absorption and emission features in solution, (2) a red shift of the absorption and emission maxima, caused by a confined environment of high viscosity, and (3) an energy transfer process from the monomer at the tube's walls to the included dye guest, which was characterized by photoluminescence (PL), excitation, and transient absorption measurements. When different dyes are co&#8208;encapsulated, the tubular supramolecular polymer provides a unidimensional confined chiral environment to promote sequential energy transfer processes between them.

A complex featuring an Au(0)&#8211;Au(0) &#963;&#8208;bond is stabilized by tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P ligands, with the &#963;&#8208;bond serving as a two&#8208;electron donor to the Mg centers and enabling two&#8208;electron reductions of various substrates. This work highlights the significance of ligand design for stabilizing low&#8208;valent Au center and provides new cases to explore the properties of dinuclear Au(0) complexes.








Abstract
Despite significant advances in gold chemistry, the synthesis and stabilization of gold centers in a low oxidation state, particularly dinuclear Au(0) species, remain a considerable challenge. In this work, we report the successful isolation of a novel dinuclear Au(0) complex stabilized by tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P ligands. Computational studies demonstrate that the Au(0)&#8211;Au(0) &#963;&#8208;bond acts as a two&#8208;electron donor to the Mg centers. Reactivity studies further revealed the complex's unprecedented ability to perform two&#8208;electron reductions on a range of substrates, akin to the behavior of well&#8208;established Mg(I) and Zn(I) dimers.

         <title>A C&#8208;to&#8208;B Atom Swap on Coumarins and Dibenzolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic boronic hemiesters, boron isosteres of lactones, display unique and valuable chemical properties. Herein, we report a novel method for their synthesis via nickel&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation, enabled by electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands to achieve a formal &#8220;C&#8208;to&#8208;B&#8221; atom swap. This strategy efficiently transforms a variety of coumarin derivatives and seven&#8208;membered dibenzolactones into the corresponding benzoxaborines, showcasing broad functional group tolerance and synthetic versatility.








Abstract
We report a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;boron &#8220;C&#8208;to&#8208;B&#8221; atom swap reaction to transform readily available coumarins into their isosteric benzoxaborins via a net replacement of the C&#9552;O group with a B&#9472;OH moiety. These conditions were applied to coumarin natural products and other 6&#8211;7&#8208;membered lactones (25 examples, 29%&#8211;93%). We leverage this methodology to transform a flat polyaromatic hydrocarbon into three&#8208;dimensional tribenzo[b.d.f]oxepines through a series of atom&#8208;swapping reactions followed by ring expansion via the oxaborin intermediate.

         <dc:description>
Thioimidates serve as a synthetic branch point for other functional groups but are relatively unexplored in radical and polymer chemistry. This study marks the first investigation of thioimidate radical chemistry and subsequent elaboration into diverse polymeric amidines.








Abstract
The first reactions of thioimidates under radical&#8208;mediated conditions are described along with the delineation of structural factors that impact radical reactivity and possible side reactions. Thioimidate&#8208;containing copolymers with methylmethacrylate (MMA) are synthesized through radical&#8208;mediated, chain&#8208;growth polymerization. These materials serve as a synthetic branch point for facile conversion into amidines by treatment with a weak acid and an external amine. Our approach allows for more diverse amidine structures than have been previously reported in polymers. This chemistry also enables crosslinking to form novel hydrogels with finely tuned acid&#8211;base behavior. Subsequent examination of the acid&#8211;base properties revealed that these features are preserved across linear, soluble amidine polymers to cross&#8208;linked amidine gel polymer&#160;architectures.

         <title>Synergistic Covalently and Mechanically Interlocked Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the innovative design and construction of a synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP), in which the covalent polymer (CP) and the mechanically interlocked polymer (MIP) are seamlessly integrated into a unified system. This design effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional polymer networks, establishing a new paradigm in the field of novel materials design.








Abstract
Integrating different polymer types into a unified system in a thoughtful manner leverages their complementary advantages, providing a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance materials. Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs), characterized by their unique spatial entanglement, exhibit distinctive performance advantages, yet their potential to expand material properties through rational integration with other polymer architectures presents substantial opportunities for continued investigation. Herein, we report a coherent integration of covalent polymers (CPs) and mechanically interlocked polymers through sequential orthogonal polymerizations, developing a novel synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP) featuring both structural stability and force&#8208;induced dynamics. Compared to its structurally similar but noninterlocked control sample, CMIP demonstrates markedly enhanced thermomechanical stability and performance recovery, achieving a 93.4% recovery efficiency at 100% strain after just 5 min of rest, in contrast to 59.7% for the control. This remarkable stability and recovery result from the synergistic interplay between the covalent polymer framework and the interlocked structure, which work in tandem to preserve network integrity and enable rapid host&#8722;guest reformation. Notably, despite this significant improvement, CMIP retains a comparable damping capacity (91%&#160;versus 87%) and material toughness (14.8&#160;versus 15.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), owing to the efficient energy dissipation mechanisms enabled by host&#8722;guest dissociation and subsequent sliding motion. This strategy imparts CMIP with unique characteristics, offering a prospective pathway for the development of a diverse array of advanced synergistic materials with enhanced, multifaceted properties.

         <title>Biocatalytic Alkylation of Ambident Nucleophiles Enables Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Heterocycles and Late&#8208;Stage Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes are key structural motifs in bioactive compounds, but their regioselective synthesis via coupling of readily available azoles with haloalkanes remains very challenging. Here, we present a mild biocatalytic approach that proceeds on gram&#8208;scale, is highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, offering rapid access to valuable N&#8208;alkylated building blocks and enabling demanding late&#8208;stage alkylations.








Abstract
The alkylation with electrophilic haloalkanes is a key methodology in chemical synthesis to build desired molecules. Although alkylation of compounds bearing a single nucleophilic site is routine, the selective alkylation of polyfunctional molecules with multiple competing nucleophilic positions of comparable reactivity is often very challenging. In this work, we report a generalizable solution for selective alkylation chemistry that combines the selectivity of enzyme catalysis with the reactivity of off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf alkylation reagents. We employ engineered transferases in a modular cyclic cascade and use functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes as challenging proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept substrates. This catalytic alkylation approach is mild, highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, proceeds on gram&#8208;scale, provides rapid access to important N&#8208;alkylated heterocyclic building blocks and enables challenging late&#8208;stage alkylations. This study demonstrates a generalizable strategy to streamline synthetic routes to many pharmaceutically important compounds by selective biocatalytic alkylation of polyfunctional molecules and ambident nucleophiles.

         <title>Stretch&#8208;Induced Structural Ordering and Orientation for Tensile Yield Behavior and Anisotropic Optical Property of Molecular Granular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular granular materials (MGMs) based on functional molecular clusters with hierarchical structures can be feasibly synthesized through supramolecular interaction. The stretch process contributes to the structural orientation and ordering of the MGMs with viscoelasticity and anisotropic optical property.








Abstract
The densely packed sub&#8208;nm particles, molecular granular materials (MGMs), represent a new class of functional materials that deliver distinct mechanical properties from polymers and conventional granular materials. However, their costly synthesis and the vague understanding of their mechanical property hinder extensive progress. Herein, the supramolecular complexation approach is developed for the feasible construction of MGMs with hierarchical structures, while in situ small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) is applied to monitor the mechanical deformation of MGMs for microscopic understanding. Amphiphilic oligomers are assembled from the ionic attraction of 1&#160;nm molecular clusters and further pack into ordered hexagonal phases (HEX1) driven by hydrophobic interaction. Interestingly, stretching can induce structural orientation, and thus triggering the transformation of HEX1 to another hexagonal phase (HEX2) with denser packing, accounting for the tensile yield behavior of the MGMs. The supramolecular structure endows hierarchical structure relaxation dynamics, enabling their unique viscoelasticity with a resilient rubbery plateau even at high temperatures. Their flexibility renders the capability to facilely process the MGMs into highly oriented films and coatings with anisotropic properties for potential applications in optical device fabrications.

         <title>Molecular Rotors as Reactivity Probes: Predicting Electrophilicity from the Speed of Rotation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new empirical parameter, ERB, quantifies electrophilicity from rotational barriers of N&#8208;phenylimide molecular rotors. ERB predicts reactivity trends in Michael additions, SN2, SNAr, Pd&#8208;oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions by capturing both attractive and repulsive transition state interactions.








Abstract
A new empirical electrophilicity reactivity parameter, ERB, was developed based on the rotational barriers of a series of N&#8208;phenylimide molecular rotors containing various electrophilic groups. In the bond rotation transition state, these electrophilic groups form close contact with an electronegative C&#9552;O oxygen. Thus, strong electrophilic groups significantly lowered the rotational barrier. As a result, the rotational barriers were inversely correlated with the strengths of the electrophiles. The rotational barriers were measured by dynamic NMR (EXSY), enabling the quantification across a wide range of types of electrophiles. Computational analysis confirmed that the observed variations arose from intramolecular interactions in the transition state, where the C&#9552;O oxygen served as a probe of both the electrophilic group's electrostatic potential and steric accessibility. By simultaneously capturing attractive and repulsive transition state interactions, ERB provides an effective means of predicting electrophilicity and reactivity trends across a broad range of electrophiles and reaction types. The utility of ERB was initially validated using a series of rotors containing Michael addition electrophiles, followed by broader application to a diverse array of reactions involving sp3 and sp2 electrophiles, including SN2, SNAr, Pd&#8208;oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions.

Tidying away gases and anions. The complementary storage &amp; in&#8208;solution release of tetrafluoride (SOF4), sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) anions was achieved. This was performed using fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO2&#8208;OSF5) a stable, high boiling liquid, obtained from SO2 and the pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) prepared quantitatively in gram&#8208;scale. Here, the gas free anion precursor of the emerging OSF5 chemistry and a dual&#8208;SuFEx reagent for one&#8208;pot synthesis of Sulfonyl fluoride (&#9472;SO2F) and Sulfurimidoyl Fluoride (&#9472;N&#9552;S(O)F2) is presented.








Abstract
Herein, the investigation of inorganic reagents containing the pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) moiety is presented. First, the gram&#8208;scale preparation of the reactive yet stable pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) as well as its spectroscopic data are reported. Then, the preparation and full characterization of the corresponding fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO3SF5, FSPO) by the fluoro&#8208;pentafluorooxosulfanylation of SO2 are highlighted. This liquid reagent (b.p. 39.6&#160;&#176;C) was later successfully used for modulable release of [cat][OSF5] ion&#8208;pair. The selective, in&#8208;solution release of SOF4 and SOF4/SO2F2 species was also demonstrated. Finally, the SuFEx reactivity was investigated and showed interesting reservoir ability. Indeed, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sulfonyl fluoride (&#8208;SO2F) and sulfurimidoyl fluoride (&#9472;N&#9552;S(O)F2) species.

         <title>Ag&#8314;&#8208;Mediated Structural Reconstruction of a Metastable Cu35 Cluster Toward Cu&#8211;Ag Heterometallic Architectures for Superior Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural remodeling of a high&#8208;nuclearity Cu35 nanocluster via Ag+ ion etching enables the construction of a bimetallic Cu14Ag6 cluster. Its Ag&#8943;Cu&#8943;Cu trimetallic sites disrupt conventional symmetric C&#9472;C coupling pathways, achieving highly selective electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion.








Abstract
Controlled structural transformations of metal nanoclusters (NCs) via dynamic bond reorganization provide fundamental insights into cluster reactivity and open avenues for functionality tuning. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene&#8208;protected Cu(I)&#8208;alkynide cluster, {NaCu35(TC4A)4(Ph&#8208;C&#8801;C)20} (Cu35), which exhibits remarkable structural plasticity. This metastable cluster can grow into a Cu36 species via ion substitution or undergo thermal&#8208;induced fragmentation to form a smaller Cu14 cluster. Under thermal etching by Ag+ ion, structural reconstruction is triggered, leading to the formation of the bimetallic Cu14Ag6 and Cu40Ag16 clusters. The structural reorganization significantly alters the catalytic outcomes in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Although the monometallic Cu35 and Cu14 favor gaseous CH4/C2H4 production, the bimetallic Cu14Ag6 demonstrates remarkable selectivity for ethanol synthesis. Notably, Cu14Ag6 achieves an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 49.27% for ethanol production, alongside a high partial current density of &#8722;67.94&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This marks the highest ethanol selectivity reported to date for atomically precise cluster catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, compared to homometallic Cu&#8943;Cu dual sites (which typically favor C2H4), the unique Ag&#8943;Cu&#8943;Cu trimetallic microstructure in Cu14Ag6 is more thermodynamically favorable for asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CHO and *OCH2, facilitating the formation of the key *CHO&#8722;*OCH2 intermediate, which drives the ethanol&#8208;selective pathway.

         <title>Deuterated Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Pure&#8208;Green Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIE Coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and Long Lifetimes</title>

         <dc:description>
Utilizing a sequential borylation strategy, we constructed a deuterium pure&#8208;green MR&#8208;TADF emitter. The associated device achieved narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm, CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.75), a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.6% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off and a lifetime (LT80) of 6078 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, especially high&#8208;order B/N MR&#8208;TADF emitters, offer new opportunities in obtaining wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut, high color purity, and highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Extending the device durability is still very challengeable for these emitters. Deuteration of emitters to slow down their degradation and lengthen device lifespan is a promising strategy. However, how to access deuterated high&#8208;order MR&#8208;TADF emitters remains to be explored. Herein, a synthetic protocol of high&#8208;order B/N products is proposed using deuterated starting materials and sequential borylation. Combining with fine&#8208;tuning electronic effect through adjusting position of tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) substituents, we successfully obtained deuterated triboron MR&#8208;TADF material &#969;&#8217;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;D that delivers precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The resulting binary OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.6% at maximum and 30.7% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2. Additionally, an Ir(ppy)3&#8208;sensitized device shows excellent operational stability, with an extrapolated lifetime (LT80) of 6078 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&#8722;2. This study hence offers a promising methodology toward high&#8208;performance OLED with long device lifetime.

A systematic study is presented that investigates the influence of the excluded volume effect by macromolecules on supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. Upon crowding, the discotic supramolecular monomers sequentially assemble into polymers and higher&#8208;order aggregates (HOAs), affected by the macromolecule's concentration, size and polarity. The proven tunability and general applicability of this entropically driven assembly open new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.








Abstract
Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in biological systems by regulating dynamic processes, yet its effects in fully synthetic environments remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically investigate how excluded volume effects influence supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. We employ various discotic supramolecular monomers that assemble sequentially into polymers and kinetically&#8208;controlled higher&#8208;order aggregates (HOAs) only in the presence of macromolecular crowders. The phase diagram of the supramolecular assemblies reveals a strong dependence on the macromolecule concentration, size, and polarity, which can be tuned to control polymerization. Remarkably, at high crowder concentrations, large condensed and aligned assemblies were observed in dried samples, suggesting a transition to phase&#8208;separated states. By testing different monomers, macromolecules, and solvents, we establish the general applicability and versatility of macromolecular crowding in guiding supramolecular polymerization. This work provides fundamental insights into assembly processes in crowded environments and opens new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.

         <title>C(sp2)&#9472;H Bond Activation with a Heterometallic Nickel&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>

Despite the prevalence of Ni/Al catalysts for pyridine C&#9472;H functionalization, mechanistic details of such systems remain scarce. Herein, we present the discovery of PCy3&#8208;catalyzed bond&#8208;breaking and making processes that occur in the coordination sphere of a novel Ni&#9472;Al heterometallic complex. The reaction is 1st order in PCy3 and proceeds with a low KIE of 0.9&#8211;1.1. These data suggest that both C&#9472;H activation and H2 reductive elimination steps in this system are low energy, are readily accessible, and are not rate limiting.








Abstract
Herein we present a ligand&#8208;catalyzed bond&#8208;breaking and making process that occurs with a Ni&#8211;Al heterometallic complex. While combinations of Ni pre&#8208;catalysts and Al additives are known for site&#8208;selective C&#9472;H functionalization, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD)2] and [(BDI)AlH2] (1; BDI&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketiminate) results in facile formation of a Ni&#8211;Al heterometallic complex [(&#951;4&#8208;COD)Ni{(&#956;&#8208;H)2Al(BDI)}] (2; COD&#160;=&#160;1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp2)&#9472;H activation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H2 evolution, a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy3. The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labeling studies, and modeling. The reaction is 1st order in PCy3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9&#8211;1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C&#9472;H oxidative addition and H2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.

         <title>Design of Tough 3D Printable Elastomers with Human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;Loop Reinforcement Learning</title>

This research demonstrates how machine learning, guided by human expertise, can accelerate materials discovery. We developed a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop reinforcement learning approach that identified high performing 3D&#8208;printable elastomers. We discovered materials with double the average toughness of empirically discovered elastomers, and we identified structure&#8208;property relationships to guide future polymer design.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance elastomers for additive manufacturing requires overcoming complex property trade&#8208;offs that challenge conventional material discovery pipelines. Here, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress&#8211;strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi&#8208;component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (&gt;10&#160;MPa) and high strain at break (&gt;200%). Analysis of the high&#8208;performing materials revealed structure&#8208;property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine&#8208;guided, human&#8208;augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi&#8208;objective materials optimization.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Mott&#8211;Schottky Analogy in SnCu Nanoalloy Promote High&#8208;Efficiency Urea Electrosynthesis at Ultralow Potential</title>

         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;enriched Cu active sites arising from an atomic&#8208;scale Mott&#8211;Schottky analogy in SnCu nanoalloy catalyst, exhibited quadruple synergism: enhanced CO2 and NO3&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption, elevated *CO surface coverage, accelerated *NHO&#8208;*CO coupling, and concurrent HER suppression, collectively achieving a twofold enhancement in urea yield compared to pristine Cu.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722; offers a sustainable strategy to address environmental challenges and growing urea demand. However, current systems suffer inefficient C&#8208;N coupling due to poor selectivity toward critical C/N&#8208;intermediates. Herein, we engineered atomic&#8208;scale Mott&#8211;Schottky analogy in SnCu nanoalloy to create electron&#8208;enriched Cu sites, enabling remarkable urea production through quadruple synergy. Sn2Cu delivered exceptional urea yield (28.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1) with 46.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in H&#8208;cell, while demonstrating practical potential with superior catalytic performance (yield: 72.6&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1, FE: 41.3%, stability: 60 h) at &#8722;0.52&#160;V in flow cell. In&#8208;situ synchrotron radiation&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed electron&#8208;enriched Cu active sites enhanced CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption and *CO coverage, while steering reaction pathway toward *CO&#8208;*NHO coupling and suppressing hydrogen evolution, thereby reducing rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier and prioritizing C&#8208;N coupling. This work develops a structure&#8211;adsorption&#8208;reactivity framework, providing fundamental guidance for advanced urea electrocatalyst design.

A structural fingerprint optimization strategy is proposed for the 1[TMOF4]&#8734; chain&#8208;based compounds, aimed at modifying the geometric features of functional chains to maximize the optical nonlinearity. In the ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal (H3O)(Biu)2(NbOF4), the structural fingerprints of the functional chains satisfy the ideal criteria, resulting in a record&#8208;breaking second harmonic generation (SHG) response (10.8&#160;&#215;&#160;KH2PO4) among all known transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. 








Abstract
Partial fluorination of oxides has positioned oxyfluorides as a promising class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their balanced optical properties. However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chain&#8208;based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors, namely, the &#8736;(O&#9472;Nb&#9472;O&#8242;) bond angle, &#967;[F,Nb,Nb&#8242;,F&#8242;] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO2F4] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating &#960;&#8208;conjugated biuret (C2H5N3O2) molecules with optimally aligned 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chains, we synthesized (H3O)(Biu)2(NbOF4) (Biu&#160;=&#160;biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH2PO4, among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.062 @1064&#160;nm) and wide band gap (Eg&#160;=&#160;4.50&#160;eV) further support its potential as a high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material. These results highlight the power of structural fingerprint optimization in fully activating polar chains and offer a new strategy for designing next&#8208;generation UV NLO crystals with enhanced SHG performance.

&lt;p&gt;The image illustrates the HIF1&#945;-VHL signalling pathway as a set of interconnected gears. Our visible-light peptide, PSB-BCB-04, enables conditional stabilization of HIF-1&#945; under normoxia by means of a tetra-ortho-fluoroazobenzene staple, whose cis conformation inhibits the VHL complex by disrupting the EloBC-pVHL interaction.

         <dc:description>
Using electrochemistry to enact organic molecule transformations offers a potential route towards greener chemical manufacturing. However, such reactions can often be complex with a multitude of factors at play. In their Communication (e202509115), Yanwei Lum et al. performed a systematic study of the impact of electrolyte cations on the selectivity of electrochemical C&#9472;H chlorination of cyclohexane. It was found that larger cations increase the propensity towards the formation of chlorine radicals, which then facilitates the formation of chlorocyclohexane through a radical non&#8208;chain mechanism.

         <title>Engineered Nanofluidics for Molecular Recognition and Physical Perception</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofluidics has garnered significant attention due to the designability and unique transport features at the nanoscale. With the development of nanofabrication, nanofluidic devices are systematically developed for ultrasensitive molecular recognition and physical perception, paving the way for intelligent recognition applications in the fields of bioscience, food safety, medical diagnostics, and so on.








Abstract
Nanofluidics has garnered significant attention as the ultra&#8208;sensitive method for molecular recognition and physical perception that are not easily accessible through the traditional methods. The development of nanofluidic devices necessitates the integrated solid&#8208;state nanochannels/nanopores with versatile surface modification strategies using precise nanofabrication techniques. This review systematically summarizes the development of the solid&#8208;state nanochannels and nanopores, nanofabrication methods, sensing principles, transport characteristics, and the strategies employed to perceive molecules and physical stimuli. The discussion also emphasizes promising research directions and explores how the interaction between interface chemistry influenced by molecular recognition and physical stimuli, in conjunction with the exceptional ion transport properties of nanofluidic devices, significantly impacts the sensing performance of the nanofluidics. Lastly, we present the vision for the future prospects of biomimetic nanofluidic devices in ionic sensing applications.

Recent developments in iron&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative transformations using CO as a C&#8321; feedstock are summarized in this minireview. Reaction mechanisms of selected reactions and the potential for further advancements in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
The utilization of carbon monoxide (CO) as an inexpensive and indispensable C1 feedstock for the efficient construction of diverse carbonylated compounds has been a subject of numerous studies for decades. Nowadays, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation represents a pivotal synthetic approach for the generation of carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules. Among the known catalysts for these transformations, non &#8208;noble metal&#8208;based systems have garnered increasing interest in recent years due to their substantial advantages, including wide availability, low cost, and low toxicity. In this review, we have summarized and discussed original and recent developments in iron&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative transformations, wherein CO is utilized as the C1 feedstock.

         <dc:description>
Privileged chiral catalysts have transformed asymmetric synthesis, conferring generality to processes that are routinely leveraged in the construction of societally important functional small molecules. This mini&#8208;review is intended to survey the conception and evolution of privileged chiral photocatalyst scaffolds that enable simultaneous orchestration of reactivity and enantioselectivity in non&#8208;ground state regimes.








Abstract
Privileged chiral catalysts have transformed asymmetric synthesis, conferring generality to processes that are routinely leveraged in the construction of societally important functional small molecules. Operating in the ground state, these catalysts are conspicuous in their ability to simultaneously regulate reactivity and translate chiral information, often with broad substrate tolerance: this technology continues to expedite chemical space exploration. In stark contrast to the specificity of many enzymatic transformations, this promiscuity affords remarkable latitude for creative endeavour in synthesis. Given the transformative impact that stereoselective photocatalysis has had over the last decade, identifying privileged chiral catalysts that permit reactivity and enantioselectivity to be regulated in excited&#8208;state scenarios has emerged as an attractive but challenging frontier. Providing solutions to address this paradox will require the reactivity/selectivity divide to be reconciled through the validation of chiral scaffolds that effectively operate in non&#8208;ground state environments. Inspired by the venerable treatment by Yoon and Jacobsen entitled &#8220;Privileged chiral catalysts&#8221; (Science 2003, 299, 1691&#8211;1693), this mini&#8208;review is intended to survey the conception and evolution of privileged chiral photocatalyst scaffolds, and offer a perspective on emerging contenders.

This Reply addresses Ceroni's Correspondence, which proposed a revised electron transfer (ET) mechanism for the cyanoarene&#8208;photocatalyzed consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) process via time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. While their model highlights solvated electrons from the excited radical anion 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenyl amino)phthalonitrile (4DPAPN&#8226;&#8722;), new experimental and theoretical analyses underscore the plausibility of the original proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET)/ConPET pathway. Rigorous reinvestigation under controlled conditions reaffirms the complexity of the mechanism and calls for further spectroscopic and computational studies to resolve these interplaying pathways. The discussion advances the debate on photoredox mechanisms, offering actionable strategies for future mechanistic elucidation.








Abstract
In this journal, a Correspondence by Ventura, Cozzi, and Ceroni reported time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy studies in the electron transfer process from cyanoarene photocatalyst 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenyl amino)phthalonitrile (4DPAPN) in the presence of tetrabutylammonium oxalate (TBAOx). This was used as a model reaction to investigate the mechanism of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) in our previously reported asymmetric [3+2] photocycloaddition. They proposed a new electron transfer pathway in which the electron from the excited state of the radical anion 4DPAPN*&#8226;&#8722; solvated in acetonitrile. This article replies to their Correspondence, including: the experimental and theoretical analysis on the driving force of electron transfer and a series of new experiments conducted with purer reagents under more stringent conditions, which suggest that the process of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) followed by ConPET cannot be excluded, as proposed in our previous publication. Yet, Ceroni et&#160;al.&#8217;s efforts to study organic photochemical reactions using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy remain worthwhile, and their proposed mechanism also led us to consider other possible pathways for the reaction. This article concludes with a series of constructive suggestions for further studying the ConPET mechanism using time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy and other techniques.

         <title>Digital&#8208;Twin&#8208;Assisted Insights Into Irreversible Capacity and Activation Strategy Power High&#8208;Loading Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the origin of the rapid capacity fading of the cathodes with the increasing electrode thickness in the Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which stems from sluggish lithium diffusion in the solid&#8208;state electrolytes as a result of &#8220;sandwich&#8221; concentration gradients in the discharged electrode. With the help of 3D digital&#8208;twin electrodes and 4D&#8208;resolved simulations, an electrode scale irreversible&#8208;lithium model is firstly proposed, and an in situ photo&#8208;induced activation strategy enabled improved lithium diffusion in a high&#8208;loading electrode.








Abstract
In solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the fraction of active materials involved in electrode electrochemistry reduces with the increase of electrode thickness. Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current collector as in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando charge and mass transport. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on simplified models. Herein, we build digital&#8208;twin electrodes with digital&#8208;space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital model&#8208;driven simulation, we find an &#8220;lithium trapping&#8221; effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Responsive Up&#8208;Regulation of Bifunctional Disulfides for Suppressing Protein Misfolding and Promoting Oxidative Folding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;responsive folding promotor was developed by conjugating metal&#8208;binding ligands and a redox&#8208;active disulfide. The oxidative strength of the bifunctional disulfide was enhanced by metal coordination, inhibiting protein misfolding and up&#8208;regulating the oxidative folding capacity under metal stress. The disulfide compound also promoted oxidative folding of a pharmaceutical peptide and was used to suppress pathological protein aggregation.








Abstract
The stress&#8208;responsive up&#8208;regulation process is a sophisticated biological response to maintain cellular homeostasis. In intracellular anti&#8208;oxidant systems, the expression level of oxidoreductases is up&#8208;regulated under oxidative stress, mitigating oxidative damage on biomolecules and enhancing protein folding capacity. Herein, inspired by the biological system, we developed a synthetic folding promotor whose reactivity is up&#8208;regulated under stress conditions. We conjugated two metal&#8208;binding 1,4,7,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) ligands and a redox&#8208;active disulfide to obtain cyclam&#8208;SS, whose reactivity can be enhanced under metal&#8208;induced stress. Metal coordination increased the redox potential of cyclam&#8208;SS, activating it as an oxidant. While CuII ions severely hampered the oxidative folding of substrate polypeptides, cyclam&#8208;SS exhibited bifunctional folding&#8208;promoting properties, i) suppressing CuII&#8208;mediated misfolding and aggregation, and ii) harnessing CuII to enhance oxidative folding. Cyclam&#8208;SS was also useful for disulfide&#8208;bond formation to promote oxidative folding of pharmaceutical and pathological proteins, as demonstrated with proinsulin and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, cyclam&#8208;SS protected cultured cells from copper&#8208;induced stress. Thus, we demonstrated the induction of the stress&#8208;responsive up&#8208;regulation process by a bifunctional folding promotor controlling the folding status of biologically important proteins under metal&#8208;induced stress. The strategy of &#8220;stress&#8208;responsive up&#8208;regulation&#8221; could aid the development of novel synthetic materials for treating intracellular stress and related disorders.

         <title>Polycation Engineering in Polymeric Metal Halides Enables Tunable and Multicolor Emission from Single Transition&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a polycation engineering strategy, distinct emission centers resulting from different coordination geometries of the same metal have been obtained. This allows manganese halides to achieve continuously tunable emission from green to red, and enables the photoluminescence of copper halides to be linearly modulated from blue to yellow.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional metal halides have emerged as a versatile platform for the development of light&#8208;emitting materials, but achieving tunable or even multicolor emission from a material containing a single type of metal has proven highly challenging. Here, we leverage the &#8220;structural tolerance&#8221; of recently&#8208;developed polymeric metal halides to integrate two distinct coordination units of a single metal into a material, thereby achieving highly tunable optical properties in single&#8208;phase metal halides. By manipulating the steric hindrance of polycations, facilely adjustable green, red or bicolor emission can be realized in manganese bromides, which originates from controllable transformation from manganese&#8208;bromine tetrahedra into octahedra. This design principle is further extended to polymeric copper halides, wherein broad self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions derived from distinct copper&#8208;iodine polyhedrons allow the emission colors to be linearly tunable from blue to yellow, encompassing pure white light, by tailoring the composition, excitation wavelength, or temperature. This study opens avenues for facile and precise modulation of the optical properties of metal halides by exploiting the intrinsic coordinative diversity of metal elements.

We report the design and fabrication of a self&#8208;powered blue&#8208;light photodetector based on boronate&#8208;ester&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;5) film, synthesized using hexahydroxytriphenylene and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediboronic acid organic linkers. The p&#8208;COF&#8208;5/n&#8208;Si photodetector exhibits an ultra&#8208;short rise time of 41&#160;&#181;s and a decay time of 222 &#181;s under 0&#160;V bias.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework materials have recently garnered significant interest from the scientific community due to their fascinating properties that include highly ordered porosity, structural versatility, high chemical and thermal stabilities, and facile surface modification. Herein, for the first time, we present the design and fabrication of a self&#8208;powered blue&#8208;light photodetector based on boronate&#8208;ester&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;5) film, synthesized using hexahydroxytriphenylene and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediboronic acid organic linkers. Specifically, we have developed a COF&#8208;5/n&#8208;Si photodetector that exhibits an ultra&#8208;short rise response time of 41&#160;&#181;s and a decay response time of 222 &#181;s under 0&#160;V bias. Our work integrated rapid response times and the distinctive benefit of self&#8208;powering, setting it apart from existing COF&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Abasic Site&#8208;Reactive Probe (mTAP) Enables the Manipulation of Mitochondrial DNA Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeting water&#8208;soluble probe mTAP exclusively reacts with mitochondrial abasic sites, enabling the manipulation of mitochondrial DNA levels under genotoxic stress. 








Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential genes for mitochondrial and cellular functions and acts as a cell signaling molecule in innate immune and inflammatory responses. Defects in mtDNA are implicated in a range of mitochondrial disorders and human diseases. Currently, no chemical strategy exists to prevent mtDNA loss under genotoxic stress. To address this, we developed a mitochondria&#8208;targeting probe (mTAP) that selectively reacts with key mtDNA repair intermediates&#8211;abasic (AP) sites. We confirmed that mTAP forms oxime conjugates exclusively with mitochondrial AP sites without conjugation with nuclear AP sites. Upon mTAP conjugation, DNA substrates containing AP sites were resistant to cleavage by AP endonuclease (APE1) and mitochondrial extracts. This conjugation significantly reduced the DNA&#8208;binding affinity of APE1 without affecting the DNA&#8208;binding activity of a mtDNA&#8208;packaging factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Importantly, cellular experiments demonstrated that mTAP treatment alleviated the decrease in mtDNA and transcription product levels induced by mitochondrial AP site damage. Functional assays also demonstrated that mTAP treatment did not compromise mtDNA replication activity or increase the overall mtDNA damage level. These findings highlight the potential of mTAP as a valuable chemical tool to modulate mtDNA levels under genotoxic stress.

         <title>Synergistic Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Reinforce Buried Interface Anchoring for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a synergistic self&#8208;assembled monolayer (syn&#8208;SAM) strategy by blending a non&#8208;planar molecule ABT with the commonly used Me&#8208;4PACz SAM. 1.56&#160;eV single&#8208;junction PSCs achieved a maximum PCE of 25.75% (certified 25.45%). This approach is also beneficial for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on fully textured HJT silicon bottom cells, achieving record PCEs of 31.56% (area: 1.07 cm2) and 26.57% (area: 20.06 cm2).








Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been commonly used as a single&#8208;component hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but suffer from facile &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and self&#8208;aggregations in solution and consequently poor anchoring ability with the atop perovskite layer. Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn&#8208;SAM) strategy through blending a non&#8208;planar molecule 3,3&#8208;(4&#8208;amino&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me&#8208;4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi&#8208;device compatibility. The single&#8208;junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn&#8208;SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm2) for 1.56&#160; and 1.68&#160;eV bandgap perovskites, respectively. Moreover, this approach is beneficial for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on fully textured surfaces of heterojunction (HJT) silicon bottom cells, affording PCEs of 31.56% (area: 1.07 cm2) and 26.57% (area: 20.06 cm2). All devices exhibit excellent long&#8208;term storage and thermal stability even under non&#8208;encapsulated conditions.

         <title>Photocontrolled Release of Urea Enables the Detection of Urea&#8211;Urease Intermediates by Cryo&#8208;FTIR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urease is a fast enzyme, presenting kcat of the order of 103&#8211;104 s&#8722;1. To enable the visualization of its mechanism we explored the technique of cryo&#8208;FTIR. By means of using a ruthenium complex as a caged&#8208;urea, upon light irradiation urea was released and we could see the coordination of the urea to the active site.








Abstract
Caged compounds are a valuable tool to photocontrol the release of enzymatic substrates in a reaction. For example, caged urea molecules were proposed to control urea delivery to urease reactions and aid the determination of the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. Owing to the success of several caged compounds based on ruthenium complexes, we synthesized a new inorganic caged urea (RuBpy&#8208;urea) and monitored the release of free urea by infrared spectroscopy upon irradiation. Transient infrared absorption (TRIR) indicates diffusion&#8208;controlled release of urea, and kinetics studies after photolysis demonstrate the functionality of the new caged molecule for photocontrolled delivery of urea to urease. Coupling photocontrolled delivery of urea to cryo&#8208;FTIR (fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) revealed that inhibition of urease results in different FTIR spectrum than the one observed for the noninhibited urease.

Through integrating hydrophobic and hydrophilic segment into the block copolymer, we developed organic electrochemical transistors with sufficiently good performance and suppressed water swelling/doping. This offers an approach to enhance the sensitivity to ion and dopamine in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with mixed ionic&#8210;electronic transport features have demonstrated significant potential in biosensing applications. Semiconductor polymers grafted with hydrophilic side chains have notably enhanced performance and applications. However, water&#8208;induced overswelling and doping in biocompatible aqueous environments hinder high&#8208;sensitivity detection. In this study, we introduce two block copolymers, DPP&#8208;b&#8208;Pg2T&#8208;T and NDI&#8208;b&#8208;Pg2T&#8208;T, which integrate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments to achieve balanced ionic&#8211;electronic conductivities and the sensing performance. These materials effectively suppress swelling and water doping, resulting in low noise signals in aqueous electrolytes. Consequently, devices based on two polymer materials exhibit superior ion concentration variation performance and enhanced sensing capabilities, with an improved sensitivity to dopamine (DA) of up to 266&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Imaging&#8208;Based High&#8208;Content Screening with Clickable Probes Identifies XPB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study introduces TL&#8208;alkyne as an innovative tool for bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling of endogenous XPB in live cells, facilitating the creation of a cell&#8208;based imaging HCS assay. This platform not only enabled the identification of pelitinib as a novel XPB inhibitor but also demonstrated its potential to improve cancer treatment through synergistic effects with chemotherapy.








Abstract
High&#8208;content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS's ability to directly assess drug&#8208;protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging&#8208;based HCS and bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized a probe Triptolide&#8208;alkyne (TL&#8208;alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe&#8208;labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1874 compounds containing. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with cysteine residue 342 of XPB, suppressed XPB's ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.

         <title>Regioselective Hydration of Terpenes with Cofactor&#8208;Independent Carotenoid 1,2&#8208;Hydratase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a highly regioselective and cofactor&#8208;independent enzymatic approach to terpene and terpenoid hydration using a carotenoid 1,2&#8208;hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus. Beyond detailing reaction optimization strategies, an extensive substrate scope, and scale&#8208;up potential, it explores mutagenesis and structural modeling to identify key catalytic residues and improve enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Terminally hydrated terpenes are highly sought&#8208;after compounds in the flavor and fragrance industries. However, their selective synthesis remains a considerable challenge in catalysis. Regioselective hydration of non&#8208;activated C&#9472;C double bonds is typically hindered by poor selectivity and low atom efficiency in conventional methods. In this study, we harness the underexplored potential of the acyclic carotenoid 1,2&#8208;hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus IL144, employing it as a whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst for cofactor&#8208;independent terminal hydration of a diverse range of terpenes. This enzyme demonstrates exceptional activity across more than 20 C12&#9472;C20 terpenes and shows notable tolerance to various functional groups, establishing it as a valuable tool for sustainable organic synthesis. We emphasize the critical influence of expression system choice in maximizing enzymatic performance, enabling high&#8208;yield transformations on the gram scale. Through a combination of homology modeling, consensus analysis, and targeted mutagenesis, essential residues involved in catalytic activity were identified. Notably, enhanced catalytic efficiency was only achievable through the epistatic effect of three specific mutations. These findings highlight the biocatalytic potential of acyclic carotenoid hydratase, offering a green and efficient route to the production of valuable tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Balancing Tetrahedral and Cation Entropies for Long&#8208;lifespan Low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to enhance low&#8208;temperature cycling stability in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries by balancing tetrahedral and cation entropies in hybrid electrolytes. By optimizing solvent ratios, the trend of the two entropy values is quantitatively analyzed and optimized, so as to maintain high cyclic stability while having excellent freezing resistance.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, their application is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low&#8208;temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3&#8208;butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable glass&#8208;forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid&#8211;liquid transition temperature from &#8722;16.4 to &#8722;101&#160;&#176;C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn2&#8314; to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by&#8208;reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long&#8208;term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000&#160;h at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C under 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/0.1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2, and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C). This work offers a guideline to design stable and low&#8208;temperature AZIBs, expanding the application scope for aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Structural Basis for a Scaffolding Role of the COM Domain in Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
COM domains are known as docking domains between subunits of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Here, the first structure of a fused, internal COM domain with its neighboring domains is reported. Structural, biochemical and crosslinking data show that COM domains play an unexpected role in properly positioning epimerization (E) and condensation (C) domains to facilitate shuttling of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) and efficient product assembly.








Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi&#8208;domain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of therapeutically relevant natural products. Efficient peptide synthesis relies on intricate domain interactions, whose underlying principles remain poorly understood. The communication&#8208;mediating (COM) domains facilitate interactions between separate NRPS subunits. For unknown reasons, COM domains co&#8208;occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal cis&#8208;COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a cis&#8208;COM domain within an E&#8208;COM&#8208;C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;crosslinking experiments, we investigated both cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture.

     alt="Structural Basis for a Scaffolding Role of the COM Domain in Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COM domains are known as docking domains between subunits of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Here, the first structure of a fused, internal COM domain with its neighboring domains is reported. Structural, biochemical and crosslinking data show that COM domains play an unexpected role in properly positioning epimerization (E) and condensation (C) domains to facilitate shuttling of the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) and efficient product assembly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi-domain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of therapeutically relevant natural products. Efficient peptide synthesis relies on intricate domain interactions, whose underlying principles remain poorly understood. The communication-mediating (COM) domains facilitate interactions between separate NRPS subunits. For unknown reasons, COM domains co-occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-COM domain within an E-COM-C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity-dependent photo-crosslinking experiments, we investigated both &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture. Their function as docking domains may be a secondary consequence of their division into separate donor and acceptor parts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Inositol Pyrophosphate Toolbox: Stereoselective Synthesis and Application of PP&#8208;InsP4 Isomers in Plant Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereochemically defined inositol pyrophosphate isomers (PP&#8208;InsP4) were synthesized and assigned by NMR spectroscopy using a chiral solvating agent. In the form of isotopically labeled standards, they were applied in CE&#8208;MS&#8208;based profiling of plant extracts and kinase assays, enabling structural reassignment and functional insight into enzymatic inositol phosphate turnover.








Abstract
Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well&#8208;characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP&#8208;InsPs, such as 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP5 (5&#8208;InsP7) and 1,5&#8208;(PP)2&#8208;InsP4 (1,5&#8208;InsP8), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31P&#8208;NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18O&#8208;labeled PP&#8208;InsP4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE&#8208;MS), enabling the assignment of PP&#8208;InsP4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation&#8208;induced root&#8208;specific PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer does not match any 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 and [3&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 at the 5&#8208;position, while other InsP5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP&#8208;InsP4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP&#8208;InsP4, providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.

         <title>Photoresponsive Slide&#8208;Ring Gels Enable Modulation of Sliding Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive cyclodextrin&#8208;based slide&#8208;ring gels are presented, which allow for a reversible modulation of the sliding dynamics. Upon light irradiation, the azobenzene&#8208;containing network polymers are isomerized, which alters their binding affinity toward the threaded cyclodextrins. As a result, the macrocycle sliding dynamics change, allowing for a reversible switching of the material's mechanical properties between a stiff and a soft state.








Abstract
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs) have emerged as a promising class of materials owing to their unique topology. Upon mechanical loading, the slidable cross&#8208;links of the polymer network freely translocate along the polymer backbone enabling pronounced energy dissipation in the material, which is associated with exceptional ductility and toughness. Despite the critical role of sliding dynamics in defining SRG mechanical properties, attempts to control them have primarily been limited to tuning the overall loading of macrocycles. Further, SRGs that can be triggered via an external stimulus have yet to be reported. In this work, we present light&#8208;responsive SRGs based on azobenzene&#8208;containing polymers. Reversible photoswitching of the azobenzenes modulates the sliding dynamics of the threaded &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) macrocycles. By using UV&#8211;Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that &#945;&#8208;CDs readily bind to the azobenzenes along the polymer backbone in the E configuration. Upon light irradiation, and thus isomerization to the Z isomer, the macrocycles no longer interact with the azobenzenes, allowing them to freely translocate along the polymer backbone. As a result of this E to Z isomerization and difference in sliding dynamics, the mechanical properties of the SRGs reversibly alternate between a stiff and a soft state.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Ferroelectric Induced Multifield Coupling Effect Accelerates Charge Spatial Separation for Boosting Tandem Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupled with ferroelectric polarization in plasmonic&#8208;ferroelectric WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 heterojunction accelerates spatial separation and directional extraction of charge carriers, thereby ultimately boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction integrated with benzylicalcohol C&#9472;C coupling.








Abstract
Integrating solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic&#8208;ferroelectric heterojunction (WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO3&#8208;x and ferroelectric polarization in K4Nb6O17, thereby not only promoting energetic hot&#8208;carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot&#8208;electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K4Nb6O17 surface for CO2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO3&#8208;x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is 9.87 and 6.27&#8208;folds higher than that of K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C&#9472;C coupling for directed production of more value&#8208;added hydrobenzoin (313.15&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multifield coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Regulation of Perovskite Growth and Energetics via Oligoether Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembling Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligoether chain was incorporated to construct self&#8208;assembling molecules, which can not only enable good coverage and optimized buried interface properties but also assist high&#8208;quality and ordered perovskite growth as well as regulate top energetics of perovskite. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% was realized in perovskite solar cells along with enhanced long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling molecules (SAMs) are widely used as interfacial layers to optimize the surface properties of nickel oxides (NiOx) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, less attention is paid to the effect of SAMs on the regulation of perovskite growth and energetics. Here, based on the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular backbone, an oligoether chain is introduced with different chain lengths to endow two novel SAMs, namely, EPA and MEPA, with good capability of bottom&#8208;up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiOx with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain&#8208;containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization, and importantly well&#8208;matched energy level alignment at the top surface, especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiOx/MEPA&#8208;based PSCs along with good device stability, which can maintain 90% of the initial efficiency under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions over 1260&#160;h.

         <title>Mathematical Double&#8208;Matrix Switchable Homochiral Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the first homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics showing on/off switchable second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) response. They exhibit strong SHG&#8208;CD with the anisotropy factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) up to 1.28 and a 432F2 ferroelectric phase transition, enabling the unprecedented on/off switching of both SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric active and SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric inactive states.








Abstract
Homochiral ferroelectrics have attracted increasing attention in recent years because of their distinctive chiroptical effects in contrast to ordinary ferroelectrics. Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between nonzero and zero values in both second&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibility &#967;(2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we reported homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 (BTA&#160;=&#160;3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium), which exhibits a 432F2 ferroelectric phase transition at 362&#160;K, accompanied by the switchable matrix elements between nonzero (for point group 2) and zero (for point group 432) values in both &#967;(2) and d matrices. They show strong SHG&#8208;CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432F2 phase transition enables (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase. Our findings shed light on the exploration of mathematical double&#8208;matrix switchable chiral ferroelectrics with SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response switching.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Molecular Carbons Based on Quadruple [n]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of efficient near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) emitters is constructed by combining the structural multiplicity and &#960;&#8208;extension strategies centered on quaterrylene diimide scaffold. The designed (P,P,P,P)/(M,M,M,M)&#8208;Q6H enantiomers demonstrate exceptional NIR&#8208;CPL performance with a circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) of up to 93 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
We present a molecular design strategy that combines structural multiplicity and &#960;&#8208;extension on a quaterrylene diimide scaffold to construct efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters. Through a carefully controlled synthesis involving sequential regioselective Suzuki coupling followed by Sholl&#8208;type oxidative cyclization, we successfully obtained two novel quadruple [n]helicenes (QnH). Comprehensive experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrated their distinct configurational preferences: Q5H exclusively adopted the meso (P,P,M,M) configuration, while Q6H produced only the (P,P,P,P)/(M,M,M,M) enantiomeric pair. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction unambiguously confirmed the unique &#8220;four&#8208;bladed propeller&#8221; structure of (P,P,M,M)&#8208;Q5H. Both compounds demonstrated intense NIR fluorescence emission with photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) of 47% for Q5H and 37% for Q6H. The chiral (P,P,P,P)/(M,M,M,M)&#8208;Q6H enantiomers showed exceptional chiroptical properties, including intense Cotton effects reached 719 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 410&#160;nm, a high absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.035, and prominent CPL activity across 600&#8211;800&#160;nm with a CPL brightness (BCPL) of 93 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Photodegradable and Thermo&#8208;Reversible, Soft, Transparent Dithioacetal Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile chemical platform for the development of photodegradable and thermally&#8211;reversible hydrogels is presented. The hydrogels were synthesized via a step&#8208;growth reaction of a difunctional PEG&#8208;thiol with an aromatic dialdehyde cross&#8208;linker. The photosensitive dithioacetal bonds endowed the material with photodegradable and thermo&#8208;reversible properties.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8211;reversible, chemically cross&#8208;linked polymers capable of altering their physicochemical and mechanical properties on demand, upon application of external stimuli (e.g., light, temperature), are highly desirable for the development of multifunctional materials. Herein, we report a facile chemical platform for the synthesis of photodegradable and thermo&#8208;reversible, model hydrogels consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the elastic strands and dithioacetal moieties at the cross&#8208;link points. The gels were synthesized via an acid&#8208;catalyzed step&#8208;growth reaction of a difunctional PEG&#8208;thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross&#8208;linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross&#8722;links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water&#8208;swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV (&#955; = 254&#160;nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063&#160;mW cm&#8722;1), and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by 1H NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.

The linear viscoelastic behavior of water-swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; = 254&#160;nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering the Microporous Environment of Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Bifunctionality for Promoting the Separation of Ethylene from a Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed flexible metal&#8211;organic framework featuring an engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality was achieved to provide high binding affinity for both CO2 and C2H2 and to enable efficient one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from a ternary mixture of CO2/C2H2/C2H4.








Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from mixtures with carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetylene (C2H2) is of great industrial importance but remains a critical challenge. Here, we report that a rationally designed flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (FMOF), featuring a specifically engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality, can promote the efficient one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from a ternary mixture. Adsorption isotherms and dynamic breakthrough tests provide experimental evidence confirming the selective adsorption of CO2 and C2H2 over C2H4 on such a FMOF, as well as its ability to separate C2H4 from a CO2/C2H2/C2H4 ternary mixture. Theoretical calculations and simulations provide critical insights into the flexible adsorption process and the separation mechanism of the FMOF. The bifunctionality incorporated in FMOF provides exceptionally strong binding of CO2 and C2H2 but inhibition of C2H4, which, in turn, enables high adsorption selectivity for CO2/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4. This FMOF has high potential for industrial applications in the separation of C2H4 from gas mixtures.

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Identifies RBBP7 as a New E3 Ligase Supporting Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating the ynamide covalent warhead into the solvent&#8208;exposed piperidine ring of ibrutinib, we developed degraders that effectively induce BTK degradation through recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase RBBP7. Moreover, the ynamide motif serves as a transplantable chemical handle for the development of various small molecule degraders. These findings establish a rational design strategy for constructing potent degraders.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has been recognized as a powerful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. However, the application of existing degraders is constrained by their dependence on a limited number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRBN and VHL. To address this limitation, we developed a suite of novel small&#8208;molecule degraders by integrating an ynamide electrophile into protein&#8208;targeting ligands. These compounds demonstrated remarkable target degradation capability. Subsequent proteome profiling and functional validation revealed that Cys97 residue of retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7) E3 ligase was covalently engaged and responsible for the degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the ynamide motif has proved to be a versatile and transplantable chemical handle, facilitating the development of degraders targeting a wide range of proteins, including CDK4, PDE5, PI3K, AKT, BCR&#8208;ABL, BRD4, EGFRL858R, and EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S. Notably, incorporation of ynamide into the &#8220;pan&#8208;kinase&#8221; inhibitor XO44 yielded degraders capable of simultaneously degrading various kinases, such as PI3K, Syk, AKT, and GSK&#8208;3&#946;, further highlighting the general feasibility of this approach. Importantly, the ynamide&#8208;containing degraders demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer potency compared to their parent inhibitors.

         <title>Sub&#8208;1 nm CuO&#8208;Phosphomolybdic Acid Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Controlled Pyroptosis Activation and Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under US irradiation, copper oxide&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid (CuO&#8208;PMA) effectively generates &#185;O&#8322; and &#8226;O&#8322;&#8315;, depletes GSH, and controls the valence transition of Cu(II)/Cu(I), enhancing the generation of &#8226;OH. This process leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress, releases damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, and activates pyroptosis, triggering a strong antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Inducing pyroptosis effectively transforms immunosuppressive &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into immunogenic &#8220;hot tumors&#8221; to enhance tumor immunotherapy. However, uncontrolled pyroptosis activation risks systemic inflammation and tumor metastasis. In this study, we used a solvothermal method to synthesize a sub&#8208;1&#160;nm copper oxide&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid nanosheet (CuO&#8208;PMA) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to induce pyroptosis. Owing to the narrow bandgap of CuO&#8208;PMA, the electron holes are rapidly separated under US irradiation, then quickly migrate through the sub&#8208;nanosheet structure to the surface to catalyze the formation of singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) and superoxide anions (&#8226;O&#8322;&#8315;), while simultaneously consuming glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, leveraging electron delocalization properties, US triggered the directional migration of electrons in CuO&#8208;PMA, facilitating the Cu(II)&#8208;to&#8208;Cu(I) transition to enhance hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) production. The ROS burst together with ions and h+&#8208;mediated GSH exhaustion synergistically provokes mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating the caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD axis to induce pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CuO&#8208;PMA significantly inhibited tumor growth and showed excellent antitumor immunotherapeutic effects. This sub&#8208;nanosheet amplifies ROS generation in response to the electronic delocalization characteristics of the US, which provides a new strategy for the ultrasound&#8208;controlled pyroptosis activation (sonopyroptosis) and tumor immunotherapy.

Transfer learning&#8208;driven SERS to elucidate mixtures with unknown composition and ratios.








Abstract
Identifying and quantifying compounds in unknown mixtures represents the ultimate goal of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy but remains a significant challenge in real&#8208;world applications. Existing machine learning&#8208;driven SERS methods are limited by their reliance on prior knowledge of mixture composition, while time&#8208;consuming experimental testing of all possibilities is not feasible. We integrate the molecular specificity of SERS with an adaptive transfer learning (TL) strategy to sequentially identify and quantify carnitine components in 11 unknown binary, ternary, and quaternary multicarnitine mixtures, achieving 100% identification accuracy and a mean quantitation error of only 3%. All models are trained solely on pure compound spectral data, enabling scalable, qualitative, and quantitative analysis of complex, unseen multiplex spectra&#8212;without requiring costly and time&#8208;consuming training data collection for every possible mixture. This predictive transfer learning&#8208;driven approach marks a transformative leap for practical SERS applications, allowing accurate analysis of complex mixtures without prior knowledge of components or ratios.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Assisted Confined Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Metal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;metal hybrid catalysts were constructed through enzyme&#8208;assisted confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzymes while synergistically regulating MNP size, dispersion, and electronic state via enzyme surface amino acid residues, realizing efficient cascade catalysis.








Abstract
The integration of enzymatic and metal catalysis in cascade reactions offers a highly efficient approach for producing high&#8208;value chemicals, such as chiral pharmaceuticals. However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme&#8208;assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme&#8208;metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions. The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co&#8208;encapsulation and dual&#8208;optimization of both components. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2&#8208;fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1&#8208;phenylethylamine (1&#8208;PEA), and a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in racemization conversion, compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers 91% yield, &gt;98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal&#8208;enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme&#8208;metal cascade systems.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Homocysteine Precursor to Probe Protein Active Sites and to Addict Escherichia coli to a Noncanonical Amino Acid Directly Involved in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new genetically encoded amino acid is chemically converted into homocysteine (Hcy) under mild conditions to probe and to activate protein active sites. Surprisingly, Hcy can replace cysteine or serine residues in several enzymes. Its potential for a widespread use in proteins is further underlined by rendering Escherichia coli dependent on Hcy, providing the first link between cell survival and a noncanonical amino acid directly involved in biocatalysis.








Abstract
Noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated into proteins by stop codon suppression are powerful tools to probe and expand protein structure and function. Although homocysteine (Hcy) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring amino acid, it was excluded from the universal genetic code. Hcy is very interesting, yet mostly unexplored, for probing protein active sites because of its subtle structural and electronic differences from cysteine and serine, which are widespread catalytic residues in enzymes. We report the genetic encoding of a new protected Hcy precursor, HcyX, that can be conveniently deprotected by chemical reductants or bioorthogonal reagents. We find varying and sometimes remarkable levels of activity for different purified enzymes with Hcy at catalytic positions. By exploiting partial intracellular deprotection to Hcy, we show that two proteins rendered Hcy&#8208;dependent, an intein and thymidylate synthase, can rescue growth of Escherichia coli by catalyzing a reaction essential for cell survival. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples in which cell growth is linked to a genetically incorporated ncAA directly involved in catalysis. We further demonstrate that Hcy&#8208;based disulfide bonds are chemically more stable than cysteine disulfides. Together, these findings open new paths for the experimental evolution of the genetic code.

         <title>Alkali Metal Cations Impact the Selectivity of Radical&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical C&#9472;H Chlorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we found that alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can impact the *Cl binding energy, which controls selectivity between radical&#8208;mediated electrochemical C&#9472;H chlorination and competing Cl2 formation.








Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a promising route toward facilitating organic transformation reactions in a sustainable manner. However, there are often a multitude of factors at play; hence, it can be unclear how operating conditions can be rationally tuned to optimize selectivity. Here, we demonstrate how the identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can control the selectivity of electrochemical C&#9472;H chlorination. Specifically, we obtained a 90.3% Faradaic efficiency with KCl as compared to 78.4% with LiCl for the conversion of cyclohexane to chlorocyclohexane at 1000&#160;mA using an IrOx electrode. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments indicate a greater propensity for Cl&#8722; oxidation to generate Cl radicals in the order: K+&#160;&gt;&#160;Na+&#160;&gt;&#160;Li+. This leads to an increase in the selectivity toward the chlorination of cyclohexane and a concomitant decrease in competitive Cl2 formation. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments indicate that this is likely due to a decrease in *Cl binding energy on IrOx in the presence of K+. These findings highlight the important role of alkali metal cations, which can be a key consideration for designing electrochemical organic synthesis systems.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting of Flexible Covalent Organic Pillars for Adaptive Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible covalent organic pillars (flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n) are adaptive nanotubular hosts formed via dynamic imine condensation. Their self&#8208;assembly displays an odd&#8211;even effect, yielding enantiomeric or meso duplexes. Host&#8211;guest studies reveal binding modes shaped by mutual deformation and geometric complementarity, underscoring their capacity for responsive molecular recognition. 








Abstract
Flexible covalent organic pillars (flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n) are introduced as a family of dual&#8208;open&#8208;ended nanotubular hosts constructed via dynamic imine condensation between pillararene&#8208;derived macrocyclic building blocks and conformationally mobile &#9472;(CH2)n&#9472; aliphatic linkers. These discrete molecular containers feature well&#8208;defined tubular channels capable of adaptive host&#8211;guest interactions. The self&#8208;assembly process exhibits a pronounced odd&#8211;even effect, yielding either enantiomeric or meso duplexes through distinct chiral self&#8208;sorting pathways. Host&#8211;guest interactions between flex&#8208;COP&#8208;4 and a series of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dibromoalkanes were systematically investigated using NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The resulting inclusion complexes span a continuum of binding modes&#8212;from relaxed encapsulation to strained, overpacked assemblies&#8212;governed by geometric complementarity and mutual host&#8211;guest deformation. These findings highlight the role of conformational flexibility in modulating molecular recognition under nanoscale confinement and establish flex&#8208;COP&#8208;n as a dynamic platform for mimicking adaptive features of biological receptors.

This study develops boron&#8208;doped amorphous bismuth metallene arrays for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;hydroxylamine electroreduction. The B&#8208;induced p&#8208;sp orbital hybridization and amorphous structure modulate the electronic configuration and increase active site density, thus optimizing intermediate adsorption and H* generation while lowering the energy barrier of the potential determining step. The catalyst achieves 85.3% NH&#8322;OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus RHE, which further rises to nearly 100% under pulsed potential operation, surpassing most reported systems. 








Abstract
Electrochemical hydroxylamine (NH2OH) synthesis from NOx under ambient conditions presents a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial methods, but its selectivity remains limited by unbalanced active hydrogen (H*) supply and intermediate adsorption. Herein, we develop boron&#8208;doped amorphous Bi metallene arrays for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH electroreduction. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B&#8208;induced p&#8208;sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH&#8322;OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts. This work not only proposes a novel catalyst design leveraging amorphous engineering and orbital hybridization but also demonstrates the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis in steering reaction pathways for electrosynthesis.

         <title>Anionic Coordination&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>

An anionic coordination strategy has been developed to construct a halogen&#8208;coordinated Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) for the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is found that iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d orbitals and iodide p orbitals, facilitating electron transfer from the Ni center to the adsorbed CO2 (TEOA&#160;=&#160;triethanolamine).








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a promising strategy for producing high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels. However, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction remains a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate the stabilization of intermediates by constructing halogen&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) (Ni8L12X4, X = Cl, Br, I). Theoretical calculations show that the formation of *COOH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d and iodide p orbitals, enhancing electron transfer from the Ni center to adsorbed CO2 and promoting the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni8L12I4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl&#8208; and Br&#8208;coordinated Ni MOC by 200&#8208; and 5&#8208;fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Response and Self&#8208;Powered CPL Detection in Unique Triangular&#8211;Tetrahedral Chiral Copper(I) Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halides exhibit a unique triangular&#8211;tetrahedral polyhedral configuration and enhanced nonlinear susceptibility. This kind of Cu(I)&#8208;based halide exhibits efficient second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), third&#8208;harmonic generation, and excellent circularly polarized light (CPL) detection performance. The (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 could be applied in self&#8208;powered CPL photodetection and X&#8208;ray detection with high sensitivity and radiation resistance.








Abstract
The low&#8208;coordination polyhedral architecture of Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides induces significant structural distortions, endowing these materials with remarkable circularly polarized light (CPL) activity and exceptional nonlinear optical (NLO) performance. However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors (glum) in Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared 1D chiral (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 (where MPZ is 2&#8208;methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular&#8211;tetrahedral configuration in the noncentrosymmetric cubic P1211 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH2PO4. Additionally, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and gTHG&#8208;CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG&#8208;based CPL detection in Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides. The self&#8208;powered CPL photodetectors based on (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0&#160;V and further achieve self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection with excellent low&#8208;dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure&#8211;performance relationship in chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next&#8208;generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Universal Chemical Presodiation Under Air Condition for Highly Stable Na&#8208;deficient Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal chemical presodiation strategy using Na&#8208;Bpy/DEE is proposed for Na&#8208;deficient oxide cathodes under air condition, which promotes formation of uniform and robust NaF&#8208;rich interface during presodiation. This minimizes stress accumulation and structure distortion upon Na+ intercalation/extraction to exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention.








Abstract
Layered transition&#8208;metal oxides have attracted growing attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs); however, their application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to Na&#8208;deficiency and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. Herein, a universal chemical presodiation pathway is reported with Na&#8208;bipyridine dissolved in diethyl ether (Na&#8208;Bpy/DEE) for stable Na&#8208;deficient P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) electrode under air condition. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;functional groups of Bpy&#8226;&#8722; radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na+ from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF&#8208;rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g&#8722;1, and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles. This work proposes an industrially feasible presodiation strategy to highly efficient SIBs.

It is still a novel yet challenging task to influence and alter reaction pathways by regulating active sites, while the Ce&#8208;Ov&#8208;W acid&#8211;base pairs regulated by oxygen vacancies accelerate the reaction between NH3 and gaseous/adsorbed NO, following enhanced Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood and Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanisms. The strategy tunes the catalytic activity at the atomic scale and provides fresh hints for rationally controlling the reaction pathways toward efficient nitrogen oxide (NOx) removal.








Abstract
Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR) poses considerable potential in the abatement of NOx emissions. However, the efficient adsorption and speedy reaction of reactants following the specific mechanism in a favorable way is still a challenge for enhancing catalysis. Herein, we propose the strategy aimed at adjusting electronic properties of Ce&#8208;Ov&#8208;W acid&#8211;base pairs through constructing oxygen vacancies on Ce/WOx, thereby fostering SCR activity. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that Ce&#8208;Ov&#8208;W acid&#8211;base pairs not only provide more Ce3+ sites for promoting the reactivity of adsorbed NO, but also accelerate the reaction between NH3 and gaseous NO owing to the generation of W5+ species with superior surface acidity, which enhance Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood and Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanisms, respectively. Consequently, the designed catalysts achieve over 90% NOx conversion above 250 &#176;C and exhibit higher activity than normal Ce/WO3 and V/W&#8208;TiO2 commercial catalysts, with anti&#8208;poisoning of SO2 and H2O under harsh working conditions, expecting to provide the guidance for promoting de&#8208;NOx industrial application.

         <title>The Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction as a Mechanistic Probe for Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) was recently shown to modify chemical reactivity, but it is unclear why. We introduce the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction as a mechanistic probe for some of the most popular hypotheses and provide the first experimental investigation of the DA reaction under VSC by measuring the kinetics of six different DA reactions under various coupling conditions. No significant change in kinetics was observed.








Abstract
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has recently been reported to alter reaction kinetics. Hypotheses on how it does this have been proposed, but open questions remain regarding the importance of the polarity of the reaction mechanism and of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), among other factors. We propose the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed&#8208;width cavities and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3&#8208;diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C&#9552;C bond. In all cases, no substantial changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.

The inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light&#8208;driven charge separation in the well&#8208;studied &#8220;molecular lightswitch&#8221; [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (aqueous [RutheniumII(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine)]2+[Cl&#8722;]2) were tracked by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real&#8208;time using ultrafast X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations.








Abstract
In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light&#8208;driven charge separation in the well&#8208;studied &#8220;molecular lightswitch&#8221; [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (aqueous [RutheniumII(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine)]2+[Cl&#8722;]2) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real&#8208;time using ultrafast X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. Sub&#8208;70&#160;fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra&#8208;ligand electron transfer following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;dppz metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2&#160;ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time&#8208;resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter&#8208;ligand electron &#8220;hopping&#8221; between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well&#8208;studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light&#8208;driven electron transfer chemistry.

         <title>Hybrid Active Sites in Coordination Polymers Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Acetylene Semihydrogenation in Membrane Electrode Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu coordination polymer featuring hybrid sites of open Cu sites and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes demonstrates superior performance for ampere&#8208;level acetylene semihydrogenation. The polymeric catalyst achieves 83.3% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene at &#8722;1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in pure acetylene feed and maintains stable operation with coal&#8208;derived acetylene (15%) for 200&#160;h, advancing sustainable ethylene production in membrane electrode assembly systems.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation in membrane electrode assembly systems promises a sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet faces challenges in catalyst performance and durability. Herein, we developed a Cu coordination polymer with hybrid sites that synergistically integrate open Cu sites and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These hybrid sites bestow the coordination polymer with acetylene gasophilicity, hydrophobicity toward water, and readily accessible active Cu sites, which energetically facilitate acetylene absorption and vinyl intermediate formation, thereby enabling efficient ethylene production at ampere&#8208;level current densities. In a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with pure acetylene, this polymeric catalyst achieved high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 93.1% at &#8722;0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 83.3% at &#8722;1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, with stable operation for 100&#160;h at &#8722;0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Notably, even with a 15% coal&#8208;derived acetylene at a flow rate of 60 standard cubic centimeters per minute, this catalyst system demonstrated 64.4% ethylene energy efficiency and durable performance over 200&#160;h at &#8722;0.5 A. This work advances the design of highly stable and active polymeric catalysts for electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.

         <title>Prolonging Exciton Diffusion Length via Modulating Aggregation Structures for Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Certified Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exciton diffusion length (LD) and fluid mechanics were effectively optimized by modulating the polymer aggregation structure. The printing PPHJ flexible OPVs exhibits more than 18% efficiency, and the flexible device maintained 90.4% of the initial PCE after 2000 bending cycles, showing excellent mechanical stability. Meanwhile, the rigid device exhibits 20% efficiency (certified19.68%, the highest value for the eco&#8208;friendly solvent system). Notably, the fabricated 23.60&#160;cm2 large&#8208;area module was 15.60% PCE.








Abstract
The performance of flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaics (OPVs) constrained by low short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), resulting in diminished power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compromised mechanical stability. Enhancing the exciton diffusion length (LD) is pivotal for improving device parameters, including PCE. However, the underlying mechanisms governing exciton diffusion dynamics, influenced by the aggregation structure of conjugated polymers, remain insufficiently understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interchain free energy distribution [&#916;G(r)] and strategically modulates the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor PM6 by controlling its molecular weight (MW). Medium&#8208;MW PM6 demonstrates optimized aggregation behavior, leading to extended LD and precisely tuned fluid mechanics, which facilitate the formation of a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. These advancements enable PPHJ&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer flexible devices to achieve a PCE of 18.01%, with notable improvements in JSC and FF, and retain 90.4% of their initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. Encouraged by these advantages, a record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.0% (certified 19.68%) was achieved for eco&#8208;friendly, printed OPVs (PM6//L8&#8208;BO) with small&#8208;area devices (0.0621&#160;cm2), whereas large&#8208;area modules (23.60&#160;cm2) reached an efficiency of 15.60%.

         <title>Tertiary Phosphine Diversification via Photochemical P&#9472;C Chemoselective Cleavage of Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a pentacoordinated&#8208;phosphorane EDA complex system to achieve chemoselective P&#9472;C cleavage. Through iterative implementation, this protocol realized consecutive aryl substitutions, yielding tri&#8208;diverse&#8208;aryl phosphines with customizable architectures. The metal&#8208;free and one&#8208;pot strategy demonstrated wide applications in gram&#8208;scale synthesis, post&#8208;modification of commercial ligands, and construction of P&#8208;stereogenic centers.








Abstract
Differentially substituted phosphines are indispensable in medicines, materials, and catalysis, yet their customizable synthesis, traditionally depending on unstable P&#9472;H/halogen reagents, remains formidably challenging. Here, we report a photoredox strategy enabling controllable aryl substitution through chemoselective P&#9472;C cleavage. By engineering electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between phosphonium salts and tertiary amines, this metal&#8208;free protocol realizes three consecutive hydrocarbyl exchanges for delivering tri&#8208;diverse&#8208;aryl phosphines with transition metal contamination elimination and broad functional group tolerance including unprotected amines and hydroxyls, facilitating late&#8208;stage modification of drugs/commercial ligands and construction of P,O,S&#8208;tridentate architectures and chiral P&#8208;stereogenic centers. Mechanistic studies reveal the dynamic pentacoordinated&#8208;phosphorane&#8208;complex formation nature and the radical&#8208;intermediate pathway, while the chemoselectivity originates from different P&#9472;C bond strengths. This work establishes a modular and sustainable platform for programming&#8208;level precision phosphine engineering.

         <title>When Bigger is Better: Lanthanum Complexes of Bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) FAlen Ligands as Unique Catalysts for the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Racemic &#946;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete lanthanum complexes supported by new bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) ligands act as highly efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) catalysts of simple and functional &#946;&#8208;propiolactones rac&#8208;BLR under mild conditions, returning in a controlled manner the corresponding linear polymers PBLR with high isoselectivity, no matter the nature and polarity of the solvent used.








Abstract
Discrete yttrium and lanthanum complexes supported by new bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) ligands have been prepared in high yields. Some of these so&#8208;called FAlen ligands, when coordinated onto the large La3+ in contrast to the small Y3+, can adopt an &#951;3 coordination mode of both amidine moieties. These La&#8208;FAlen complexes, either previously isolated or conveniently prepared in situ, act as highly efficient ROP catalysts of simple and functional &#946;&#8208;propiolactones rac&#8208;BLR (R&#160;=&#160;Me, CH2OiPr, CH2OSitBuMe2) under mild conditions, returning the corresponding linear polymers PBLR with high control over the molecular weights and narrow dispersities. More uniquely, when substituents with appropriate bulkiness are installed on the phenoxy and amidine moieties, the polymers all feature high isotacticity (Pm up to 0.93). High activity and isoselectivity are maintained, no matter the nature and polarity of the solvent used.

A novel &#8220;In&#8208;Lattice heterojunction&#8221; was constructed by patching cavities in defective TiO2 with Fe&#9472;N4&#8208;anchored carbon layer. It effectively catalyzes the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and achieves an NH3 yield of 88&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 by facilitating efficient radial carrier transfer and enhancing N2 adsorption.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation and carrier transfer are critical determinants of the performance of photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) which are critical for agricultural and chemical industries. In this study, a novel type of heterostructure, termed an &#8220;In&#8208;Lattice heterojunction&#8221;, has been constructed by introducing a Fe&#9472;N4&#8208;anchored carbon layer (Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C) onto the surface of defective TiO2 (D&#8208;TiO2), as well as implanting it into the cavities of D&#8208;TiO2. The in&#8208;lattice heterojunction, defined as FNCTO, achieves efficient radial carrier transfer along the Ti&#9472;C&#9472;N&#9472;Fe in&#8208;lattice atomic channel and greatly promoted N2 adsorption benefiting photocatalytic NRR. Thus, FNCTO exhibits an excellent photocatalytic N2 reduct`ion into NH3 activity (88&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), obviously higher than that of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C sites on noncavity P25, illustrating the crucial role of cavity patch induced in&#8208;lattice heterojunction. This study paves a way for the development of high&#8208;performance Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C atomic photocatalysts based on noncarbon materials.

         <title>High H2 Recovery Properties of Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Precision Derived from Dual Cross&#8208;Linked Polyimide Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>

We proposed a dual cross&#8208;linking strategy that synergizes 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid (DABA)&#8208;induced rigid networks (Type A) and sulfur bond&#8208;induced flexible networks (Type B) to fine tune submicroporosity for carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs). The Type A induced more &#8220;C&#8221; phase, whereas the Type B resulted in more &#8220;L&#8221; phase, giving the 6F&#8208;D&#8208;S&#8208;CMS membrane exceptional H2&#160;permeability (3464 Barrer) and H2/CH4&#160;selectivity (3807). This rigid&#8208;flexible design establishes a blueprint strategy for next&#8208;generation gas separation membranes.








Abstract
Energy&#8208;efficient purification technologies are essential for advancing a sustainable hydrogen economy. Carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) have emerged as promising candidates; however, achieving precise sub&#8208;Angstrom micropore control and ensuring structural stability remain significant challenges. Here, we introduce a dual cross&#8208;linked strategy to engineer microporosity of the resulting CMSMs by utilizing a decarbonylated 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid (DABA)&#8208;induced rigid network (Type A) in conjunction with a sulfur bond&#8208;induced flexible network (Type B). The 6F&#8208;D&#8208;S&#8208;CMS membrane exhibits a record&#8208;high H2 permeability of 3464 Barrer with H2/CH4 selectivity of 3807, surpassing the Robeson upper bound. Upon pyrolysis at 850&#160;&#176;C, the 6F&#8208;D&#8208;S&#8208;CMS&#8208;850 membrane achieves exceptional selectivity values: H2/CH4 at 6538, H2/N2 at 1634, and H2/CO2 at 149&#8212;outperforming most reported CMS membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Type B network suppressed CH4 adsorption (3.6 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;versus 6.2 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and significantly enhanced the small pore volume ratio (VH2/VCH4: 10.3&#160;versus 2.1) during carbonization, thereby eliminating non&#8208;selective pathways and reducing inter&#8208;skeletal spacing (4.09&#160;&#197; versus 3.78&#160;&#197;), which enables precise molecular sieving. This rigid&#8208;flexible cross&#8208;linked strategy for CMSMs establishes a scalable blueprint for next&#8208;generation hydrogen production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Strain Relief via Zinc Acetate Enables High&#8208;Efficiency InP Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel strain engineering strategy that enables stress relief and uniform shell growth at the InP quantum dot coreshell interface using a small&#8208;molecule Zn(Ac)2 precursor. This approach significantly reduces interfacial strain and boosts the PLQY to nearly 100%. The resulting QLEDs demonstrate enhanced charge injection and energy level alignment, achieving an external quantum efficiency of up to 26.3%, offering a scalable platform for advanced quantum dot and device development.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxial shell growth on quantum dots (QDs) is essential for tailoring carrier dynamics but is often hampered by core&#8211;shell interface strain, which becomes more prominent in environmentally friendly InP QDs due to their significant size effect. Although post&#8208;treatment of InP cores with zinc compounds is a common approach to alleviate interface strain, conventional synthesis methods often fail to achieve effective doping, typically leaving zinc on the core surface rather than within the lattice. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;mode strain relief strategy using the small&#8208;molecule precursor Zn(Ac)2. Its ionic bonding character and low steric hindrance enable efficient Zn doping into the InP core and promote uniform epitaxial shell growth, leading to a 50% reduction in interfacial strain and a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield in InP QDs. This approach simultaneously addresses two major sources of strain: lattice mismatch between the core and shell and steric hindrance from bulky surface ligands. The fabricated green InP&#8208;based QLED achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 26.3% and a current efficiency of 108.3&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1. We believe this strategy provides a general and scalable strain engineering platform for QDs, with broad applicability across various material systems.

         <title>Establishing 3d&#8211;4d Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>

The d&#8208;d hybridization between 3d and 4d metals can induce the modulation of the affinity of *CO intermediate, thereby accelerating the *CO hydrogenation process in photothermal CO2 methanation.








Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion offers a promising way to address the energy and environmental issues; however, the development of self&#8208;supporting catalysts with high activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self&#8208;supporting carbon cloth with N&#8208;doped carbon arrays (PdCo&#8208;NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3d&#8208;4d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz2&#8208;5&#963; and dyz&#8208;2&#960;* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self&#8208;supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO2 methanation while serving as a photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat converter to improve the temperature of the reaction system. As a result, PdCo&#8208;NC/CC exhibits unprecedented photothermal performance toward CO2 methanation, delivering a CH4 generation rate as high as 15.23&#160;mol gmetal&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source. Moreover, the continuous flow photothermal reaction can be smoothly proceeded over 100&#160;h, demonstrating the high stability of PdCo&#8208;NC/CC in CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>A Multistate Adaptive System of Topologically Distinct Chiral Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a non&#8208;covalent multistate system with seven distinct assembly products across solid and liquid states, generated from a single supramolecular synthon. Thermodynamic pathways between these states are switchable with simple external triggers. This system could pave the way for new smart materials and offer fresh insights into molecular dynamics by imitating the flexibility of biological systems.








Abstract
Biological systems exemplify the extraordinary adaptability of living organisms to their surroundings, demonstrating the capacity to reconfigure their structure, properties, and function in response to specific environmental signals. In this context, the exploration of multistate chemical systems designed to mimic natural counterparts, with the capacity to precisely tailor the structural outcome of an assembly and perform a specific function in response to external triggers, remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a multistate adaptive system of topologically distinct chiral assemblies obtained from a single amino acid&#8208;derived naphthalene diimide component and demonstrate its trigger&#8208;responsive properties. Our system yields five distinct supramolecular assemblies across both solution and solid states, achieved by modulation of external factors such as temperature, solvent, concentration, and guest molecules. The work demonstrates the remarkable adaptability of the non&#8208;covalent assemblies, revealing their profound sensitivity to external triggers, emphasizing the role of enthalpy and entropy in navigating across complex assembly pathways to and between individual outcomes.

In this context, the exploration of multistate chemical systems designed to mimic natural counterparts, with the capacity to precisely tailor the structural outcome of an assembly and perform a specific function in response to external triggers, remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a multistate adaptive system of topologically distinct chiral assemblies obtained from a single amino acid-derived naphthalene diimide component and demonstrate its trigger-responsive properties. Our system yields five distinct supramolecular assemblies across both solution and solid states, achieved by modulation of external factors such as temperature, solvent, concentration, and guest molecules. The work demonstrates the remarkable adaptability of the non-covalent assemblies, revealing their profound sensitivity to external triggers, emphasizing the role of enthalpy and entropy in navigating across complex assembly pathways to and between individual outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Structural Oscillation Mediates Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that dynamic structural oscillations within the [Ni&#8211;O2&#8211;Fe] units of NiFe LDHs identified a strong dependence on the alternating active Fe dissolution and redeposition, thus mediating the dynamic stability. Further, engineering the oscillation manners via the in situ sulfur leaching and cobalt&#8208;induced electron&#8208;withdrawing effects achieves unprecedented industrial&#8208;scale durability (&gt;800&#160;h @ 8000&#160;mA) and a record energy efficiency (4.05&#160;kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 at 4000 A m&#8722;2).








Abstract
The dynamic dissolution of active species of electrocatalysts suffers severe durability issues, thus limiting practical sustainable electrochemical application despite the enormous strides in the activity. An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni&#8211;O2&#8211;Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy with S, Co co&#8208;doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillations. In situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution, while the electron&#8208;withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co&#8211;O2&#8211;Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800&#160;h (5000&#8208;h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05&#160;kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 @ 4000 A m&#8722;2. The levelized cost of hydrogen of US$ 2.315 per kgH2 overmatches the European Commission's target for the coming decade (&lt;US$ 2.5 per kgH2).

         <title>Highly Structure&#8208;Selective On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Isokekulene Versus Kekulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis has allowed for the preparation of many novel molecular structures with intriguing properties. Here, we present a case of highly selective on&#8208;surface synthesis of the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene on Cu(110) and the prototypical cycloarene kekulene on Cu(111) from the very same specialized precursor prepared in solution.








Abstract
The role of different facets of metal nanoparticles in steering reaction pathways is crucial for the design of heterogeneous catalysts with superior selectivity. As a prominent class of reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#9472;H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92%, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (&gt;99%). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO&#8208;functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor, which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule&#8208;substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.

         <title>Chiral Tin&#8208;Oxo Cluster Matrices with Fluorophore Embedment for Multichromatic Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric tin&#8208;oxo clusters form helical supramolecular matrices through directional intermolecular interactions, enabling efficient transfer of optical handedness to encapsulated non&#8208;chiral fluorophores via spatial confinement. These assemblies exhibit tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;oxo clusters, characterized by their well&#8208;defined chemical compositions and architectures, are multi&#8208;metal aggregates composed of Sn&#8208;oxide cores and surface ligands. Chirality, a fundamental characteristic governing biological recognition and signal transduction, remains underexplored in stannate clusters compared to extensively studied precious metal clusters. Herein, three enantiomeric pairs of chiral tin&#8208;oxo clusters were constructed using axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) ligands. Structural analyses revealed supramolecular helical assemblies mediated by directional C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, while circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed their intrinsic chirality. Through in situ doping engineering, non&#8208;chiral fluorophores with distinct emission profiles were incorporated during chiral cluster crystallization, yielding composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The optimized system achieved a maximum dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies established that the spiral packing of the tin&#8208;oxo clusters facilitates stereochemical information transfer to the dyes via the spatial confinement effect. This supramolecular chirality induction paradigm offers new insights into the rational design of multifunctional optical materials.

         <title>The Overlooked Dual Phosphorescence of Lappert's Diamino Stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 shows rich photophysics and photochemistry: unprecedented dual green/orange phosphorescence with long excited state lifetimes, excimer formation, and unimolecular bond homolysis. Photolytic Sn&#9472;N bond homolysis occurs only in the long&#8208;lived excited monomer but not in the excimer.








Abstract
The first stable heavy carbene homologues, the heavy tetrylenes, were reported in 1973 by Lappert and coworkers. These tetrylenes were extensively investigated with respect to ground state reactivity, such as small molecule activation, insertion into &#963;&#8208;bonds, coordination chemistry, materials chemistry, or catalysis. Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that the bright yellow&#8208;colored diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed, involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second&#8208;order Jahn&#8211;Teller distorted structures. The present study provides new insights toward a rational design of tetrel(II) complexes with long&#8208;lived emissive excited states, with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 being the prototype.

         <title>Versatile Halide&#8208;Pair&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Polymerization for Library Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;Controlled Semiconducting Dendronized Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
A halide&#8208;pair&#8208;driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy enables the efficient synthesis of diverse sequence&#8208;controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs), including dendronized variants, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation organic materials.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;controlled semiconducting polymers represent a new frontier in organic electronics, where precise molecular sequence directly dictates device performance. However, achieving both high sequence fidelity and structural diversity remains a significant challenge using conventional synthetic protocols. To address this issue, we introduce a versatile halide&#8208;pair&#8208;driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy that enables the library synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs). By optimizing halide pairing in conjunction with a rationally designed Buchwald ligand&#8211;Pd system featuring catalyst&#8208;transfer capability, we achieved efficient sequential cascade aminations, thereby enabling the MCP. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated through the synthesis of a library of sequence&#8208;controlled PTAAs, including dendronized variants, underscoring its potential as a general platform for functional semiconducting material discovery.

         <title>Selective Sieving Effect of Multi&#8208;Atomic Bismuth Interfaces for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis and Evolution at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>

Multi&#8208;atomic Bi interfaces (Bi0/Bi&#948;+&#8722;O moiety) embedded in porous Bi2O3&#8208;x nanosheets featuring interfacial atomic sieving effect enabling efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion across pH ranges. The simultaneous production of formate on both the cathode and anode was also achieved by coupling CO2 reduction reaction with the methanol oxidation reaction under industrial current density conditions. Further intermediacy of the concentrated formate for C&#8211;N coupling toward urea synthesis, establishing pathway for sustainable evolution.








Abstract
Constructing multi&#8208;atomic interfaces architectures is promising for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion, yet their synthesis and stability under industrial current densities remain challenging. Herein, multi&#8208;atomic Bi interfaces (Bi0/Bi&#948;+&#8722;O moiety) were precisely engineered by embedding atomically dispersed Bi centers, encompassing Bi single atoms and Bi atomic clusters into the substrate of porous Bi2O3&#8208;x nanosheets. The composite showcases outstanding CO2 conversion performance across a wide pH range, attaining remarkable Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEformate) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long&#8208;term stability over 150&#160;h. Depending on the designed CH3OH electrooxidation catalyst (CuOx/ZnCo(OH)x) at the anode to couple with CO2 conversion, symmetrical/asymmetrical electrolyzers were developed. The approach could obtain high&#8208;added value products with FEformate&#160;&gt;90% at both electrodes, achieving a production rate of 4980&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under industrial current density. Combined in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that multiple atomic interfaces featuring interfacial atomic sieving effects effectively enhance preferential binding of *H and *CO2 to form *OCHO, while simultaneously suppressing the undesired recombination of hydrogen species into H2, rationalizing the high selectivity. Further intermediacy of concentrated formate precursors for subsequent C&#8211;N coupling toward urea synthesis, establishing a pathway for sustainable evolution.

         <title>Nitrogen Adsorption Sites with Low Polarizability for Benchmark N2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using porous materials for N2/CH4 separation is promising but remains a great challenge. Here, a metal&#8208;organic framework with Cu(I)&#8208;based nitrogen adsorption sites of low polarizability is proposed. It affords a new benchmark N2/CH4 uptake ratio and the highest breakthrough selectivity surpassing those of current adsorbents.








Abstract
Selective adsorption of N2 from CH4 is an industrially promising but challenging process given their similar sizes and physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a robust metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MFU&#8208;4l) featuring open Cu(I) sites of low polarizability for benchmark N2/CH4 separation. The presence of open Cu(I) sites in the framework was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ CO&#8208;adsorbed infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Gas sorption isotherms revealed that Cu&#8208;MFU&#8208;4l exhibited a significant difference between N2 and CH4 uptakes, resulting in a high N2/CH4 uptake ratio (1.94) and kinetic selectivity (2.20), of which the N2/CH4 uptake ratio was the highest among all MOFs reported to date. Breakthrough experiments confirmed Cu&#8208;MFU&#8208;4l as the best porous adsorbent hitherto reported for binary N2/CH4 separation, based on the record&#8208;high breakthrough selectivity (2.43) and CH4 productivity (0.47&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1). High&#8208;purity CH4 (99.99%) could also be obtained from ternary and even six&#8208;component CH4 mixtures by a one&#8208;step separation process. In situ infrared spectroscopy and computational modeling studies revealed that the open Cu(I) sites could better distinguish N2 and CH4.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Electric Double Layer and Zn (100) Deposition Enabled by Anions for Highly Stable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pronged electrolyte engineering strategy was employed to construct a water&#8208;poor electrical double layer and modulate vertically oriented Zn (100) plating for enhancing the reversibility of Zn plating/stripping toward highly stable Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Controlling the growth orientation of zinc (Zn) is an effective method of stabilizing Zn anodes. Although Zn (100) exhibits faster Zn electroplating/stripping kinetics than Zn (002), its high chemical reactivity results in susceptibility to water&#8208;induced side reactions. Herein, a two&#8208;pronged electrolyte engineering strategy is proposed to enhance the reversibility of Zn anodes, that is, modulating vertically oriented Zn (100) plating while simultaneously constructing a water&#8208;poor electrical double layer (EDL). Mechanistic studies revealed that the difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB&#8722;) anions of sodium&#8208;difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) function as a Zn2+ trapping agent at the inner Helmholtz layer, displacing active water molecules and inducing the preferential deposition of Zn on the Zn (100) crystal facets, thus effectively inhibiting both side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, a symmetrical cell with the ZnSO4/NaDFOB electrolyte exhibited a long lifetime of over 950&#160;h under severe conditions of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a practical Zn||NH4V4O10 pouch cell could achieves a high capacity of 156 mAh at industrial&#8208;level mass loading of 16.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This work provides insights for achieving stable Zn anodes via electrolyte engineering&#8208;triggered crystallographic orientation and EDL regulation.

         <title>Conduction Band Convergence and Modular Nanostructures: Driving High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type PbSe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo 4d orbital hybridized with the Se 4p&#8208;Pb 6p to provide conduction band convergence, and PbSe&#8208;MoSe2 modular nanostructures lead to high thermoelectric performance in MoCl5 doped n&#8208;type PbSe.








Abstract
n&#8208;type lead chalcogenides showing high thermoelectric performance are rare due to the larger energy offset between the two lowest energy conduction bands minima, leaving ample opportunity to modulate electronic structure for improving their thermoelectric performance. Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8764;1.8 at 873&#160;K in n&#8208;type PbSe doped with MoCl5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4d orbital hybridized with the Se 4p&#8208;Pb 6p. This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n&#8208;type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (&#963;S2) of &#8764;21 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 873&#160;K for PbSe&#160;+&#160;1 mol% MoCl5. When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano&#8208;heterostructures (5&#8208;30&#160;nm) of PbSe&#8208;MoSe2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano&#8208;heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.20&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at &#8764;725&#160;K in PbSe&#160;+&#160;1 mol% MoCl5 sample.

         <title>Amorphous Nitride&#8208;chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for High Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous nitrogenchloride dual&#8208;anion solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Li1.3ZrN0.4Cl4.1) with high ionic conductivity (3.01&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and broad electrochemical stability is developed. When paired with LiNi0.83Co0.06Mn0.11O2, it enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with high capacity (200.1&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 4.5&#160;V), excellent cycle retention (95.1% after 150&#160;cycles), and long&#8208;term durability (3,000&#160;cycles at 3&#160;C). The electrolyte remains stable under extreme conditions, operating at 4.8&#160;V and 50&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating strong potential for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life ASSBs.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial for advancing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Amorphous SSEs, in particular, offer promising advantages due to their grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free nature, which facilitates intimate solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact and uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, thereby improving composite electrode performance. Here, we report a class of SSEs based on a nitrogen&#8211;chlorine dual&#8208;anion framework, formulated as Li3x+0.1ZrNxCl4.1, for high&#8208;voltage ASSBs. Unlike widely studied crystalline Li2ZrCl6 with a triclinic structure, increased N3&#8722; substitution drives a structural transition to an amorphous phase (Li1.3ZrN0.4Cl4.1), which achieves a significant enhancement in Li+ conductivity from 0.46 to 3.01 mS cm&#8722;1, alongside improved oxidative stability up to 4.8&#160;V. This dual&#8208;anion SSEs exhibits excellent compatibility with high&#8208;energy LiNi0.83Co0.06Mn0.11O2 (NCM83) cathodes. The corresponding full cells deliver a high reversible capacity of 200.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4.5&#160;V with outstanding capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles at 0.2 C, along with remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability exceeding 3000 cycles at 3 C. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of Li1.3ZrN0.4Cl4.1 in conjunction with NCM83 is still preserved under elevated temperatures (50 &#160;&#176;C) and higher cut&#8208;off voltages (up to 4.8&#160;V). These results highlight the promise of dual&#8208;anion amorphous electrolytes, paving the way for the design of next&#8208;generation SSEs beyond traditional single&#8208;anion systems.

Cryptococcus neoformans cell wall &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucans as dual anchors for melanin and capsule: Solid&#8208;state NMR of intact C. neoformans cells reveals five forms of &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucans that structurally bridge melanin and capsule layers. These polysaccharides interact with chitin, chitosan, and &#946;&#8208;glucans to create a molecular scaffold that underlies virulence and antifungal resistance.








Abstract
Cryptococcus species are major fungal pathogens responsible for life&#8208;threatening infections in approximately a million individuals globally each year, with alarmingly high mortality rates. These fungi are distinguished by a distinctive cell wall architecture further reinforced by two virulence&#8208;associated layers, melanin and capsule, rendering them insensitive to antifungal agents targeting the cell wall, such as echinocandins. The molecular interplay between these three biomolecular layers remains poorly understood. Here, we employ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to examine intact cells of both wild&#8208;type and capsule&#8208;deficient strains of C. neoformans, along with melanized cells. High&#8208;resolution 13C and 1H data revealed five distinct structural forms of &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucans that play versatile roles in forming the rigid cell wall scaffold by interacting with chitin microfibrils and chitosan, and in stabilizing the mobile matrix by associating with &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucan and a small fraction of &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan. Two primary forms of &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucans were distributed throughout the wall, capable of hosting melanin deposition in the inner domain and capsule attachment on the cell surface. These findings offer a paradigm shift in understanding the cryptococcal cell wall and its interaction with two key virulence factors on opposite sides, raising critical biochemical questions that could inform the development of more effective antifungal treatments for cryptococcosis.

         <title>Catalytic Polymerization of n&#8208;Doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) Using Parts Per Million (ppm) Levels of Molybdenum Trioxide</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective catalytic polymerization of n&#8208;PBDF using ppm levels of MoO3 was developed in this study. Kinetic studies reveal that this polymerization demonstrates chain&#8208;growth characteristics, enabling the preparation of high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF polymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO3 mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This method eliminates the need for purification process, demonstrating the potential for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF ink.








Abstract
The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has significantly pushed the boundaries of organic electronics. However, to maximize its practical impact, an efficient, scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthetic method is essential. Initially, n&#8208;PBDF was synthesized via duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, but these methods required prolonged dialysis, limiting their scalability. Our recent SeO2&#8208;catalyzed polymerization improved efficiency but still necessitated centrifugation and filtration to remove solid selenium byproducts. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of n&#8208;PBDF. Remarkably, MoO3 at parts&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) concentrations achieves near&#8208;quantitative monomer conversion (&gt;99% by NMR), eliminating the need for purification. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this polymerization follows a chain&#8208;growth mechanism, enabling the synthesis of high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF polymers with controlled particle sizes and block copolymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO3 mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This innovation not only provides a scalable, low&#8208;cost route to high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF but also unlocks new synthetic opportunities, significantly expanding the synthetic toolbox for functional polymers.

         <title>Designing New Natural&#8208;Mimetic Phosphatidic Acid: A Versatile and Innovative Synthetic Strategy for Glycerophospholipid Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the role of the fatty acyl chains in biological activities of phosphatidic acids (PA). Several PA probes having two different fatty acyl chains were synthesized through a multi&#8208;steps synthesis and bearing various fluorophores or photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkers (PCL). We demonstrate that our probes maintain the biological activities of the natural PA, then we found hundreds of new proteins interacting with PA in function of their chain compositions.








Abstract
Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) play important roles in cellular compartmentalization and signaling. Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL&#8208;mediated signaling pathways.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Fe&#8208;LMCT Catalysis for Redox&#8208;Coupled Conversion of NOx and SO2 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced Fe&#8208;LMCT (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer) catalytic system is demonstrated, whereby continuous conversion of NO to N2 and SO2 to SO42&#8722; is achieved, with the formation of N2O byproducts suppressed via LMCT&#8208;driven spatial segregation of redox pathways.








Abstract
The coexistent nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in flue gas pose inherent challenges for simultaneous removal due to their disparate reactivities. Conventional sequential treatments for their simultaneous removal face major issues of catalyst deactivation and byproduct generation. Here, we develop a subtle strategy using light&#8208;induced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) catalysis with Fe(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA&#8208;Fe&#7477;&#7477;) to achieve redox&#8208;coupled conversion of NO and SO2 mixtures. LMCT excitation in EDTA&#8208;FeII induces directional charge separation under irradiation, routing photogenerated electrons (e&#8315;) to Fe&#7477;&#7477; for driving selective NO&#8208;to&#8208;N2 conversion (selectivity: 99.89%), while photogenerated holes (h+) oxidize SO2 to SO42&#8315; (selectivity: 96.34%). This spatial segregation of redox pathways suppresses N2O generation, enabling continuous operation with 90.3% NO and nearly 100% SO2 removal efficiency. Mechanism studies reveal the LMCT&#8208;enhanced charge transfer from carboxyl/amino groups to Fe centers, while in situ EPR confirms the &#8226;SO32&#8315; radical&#8208;mediated h+ scavenging that accelerates charge separation and utilization. This work establishes Fe&#8208;LMCT catalysis as a sustainable platform for gas&#8208;phase pollutants remediation, achieving unprecedented selectivity through precise redox pathway control.

         <title>Advancing Solid&#8208;State Calcium Batteries: Achieving Fast Ionic Conductivity at Near Ambient Conditions in Calcium Hydridoborates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of methylamine to calcium tetrahydridoborate enhances calcium ion conductivity significantly by increasing structural flexibility and void space as a function of increasing methylamine content. However, this results in decreasing mechanical stability. This drawback is overcome by forming nanocomposites through the addition of inert MgO nanoparticles, enabling both high ionic conductivity and enhanced mechanical stability.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries based on abundant elements, such as calcium, offer a promising route to safer, cheaper, and more sustainable energy storage. Here, we report a series of fast Ca2+&#8208;conducting compounds of methylamine calcium tetrahydridoborates, Ca(BH4)2&#183;xCH3NH2 (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&lt;&#160;4.9) and related nanocomposites stabilized by inert MgO nanoparticles. Three new crystal structures are identified: a three&#8208;dimensional network of octahedrally coordinated Ca2+ complexes for x&#160;=&#160;1, a molecular structure of neutral complexes for x&#160;=&#160;4, and a structure of cationic complexes for x&#160;=&#160;6. The thermal stability generally decreases with increasing CH3NH2 content, and samples with x&#160;&gt;&#160;2 slowly release CH3NH2 in &#8220;open&#8221; atmosphere at room temperature, but are stabilized in &#8220;closed&#8221; environments, e.g. capillaries. The ionic conductivity increases with CH3NH2 content and correlates with increased void space and structural flexibility, reaching &#963;(Ca2+)&#160;=&#160;5.0&#183;10&#8722;5&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C for x&#160;=&#160;4. Moreover, the effect of nanocomposite formation provides mechanical stability and a doubling of the ionic conductivity for Ca(BH4)2&#183;4CH3NH2&#160;&#8722;&#160;MgO (50&#160;wt%), reaching &#963;(Ca2+)&#160;=&#160;1.3&#183;10&#8722;4 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C. These findings demonstrate how local structure and nanoscale interfacial effects govern calcium transport, offering new design principles for functional calcium solid electrolytes.

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrochemical Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two robust imidazole&#8208;linked 2D COFs were developed through facile one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation reactions as the anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Remarkably, TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a high reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 with remarkable cycling performance (&lt;0.035% per cycle capacity decay over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). This superior performance stems from synergistic interplay between the stabilized imidazole linkage and abundant C&#9552;O/C&#9552;N redox&#8208;active centers.








Abstract
Exploring stable and functional linkages through facile one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation reactions represents one of the frontiers in the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which can enhance structural robustness and diversity while broadening their application potential. In this study, we report a facile synthetic strategy using p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a proton mediator to construct two imidazole&#8208;linked COFs (TABQ&#8208;COF and TAPT&#8208;COF) via one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation of aromatic aldehydes with ortho&#8208;diamines. These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity but also exhibit excellent physicochemical stability and contain abundant redox&#8208;active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (&lt;0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox&#8208;active centers (C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups), which enable efficient Na+ storage through multielectron redox mechanisms. This study highlights the strategic advantage of structurally stable COFs with precisely engineered redox&#8208;active motifs via facile synthesis for advancing high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Realizing Unconventional Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis Enabled by Co, Fe Dual&#8208;Site Conjugated Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinctive unconventional tandem pathway for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia was achieved via [6&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;electron transfer processes of &#8220;HNO3 &#8594; *NH2OH&#8221; and &#8220;NH2OH &#8594; NH3&#8221; on Co,Fe dual&#8208;site conjugated metal organic frameworks.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis, while the intricate multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer processes and unstable intermediates pose significant challenges in attaining high selectivity and efficiency. This study demonstrates a Co, Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe&#8208;cMOFs) that enable efficient NO3RR via an unconventional [6&#160;+&#160;2] electron&#8208;transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2&#160;+&#160;6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO3&#8722; to *NH2OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO2&#8722; and guarantees selective NH3 production. The CoFe&#8208;cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery prototype incorporating CoFe&#8208;cMOFs exhibits 3.6&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 peak power density with stable NH3 production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Superior Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers has been synthesized from an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine ligand. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits superior sodium storage capability with a high reversible capacity, outstanding rate performance, and remarkable long&#8208;term cyclability due to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites, prominent conductivity, and excellent stability.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, developing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with multiple redox&#8208;active sites and well&#8208;defined structures to enhance the performance of SIBs and elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationship remains challenging. Herein, a 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystal (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH&#8208;TBP) ligand. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic&#8208;level crystal structure of Cu&#8208;TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer&#8208;stacking. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu&#8208;TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1). Experimental studies combined with theoretical calculations further elucidate the Na+ storage mechanism.

         <title>A Robust Nickel&#8208;Interlocked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Catalyst for Photocatalytic Aromatic Finkelstein and Retro&#8208;Finkelstein Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni@COF1&#8208;Catalyzed Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions are reported! Comparative studies reveal that a nickel&#8208;functiontionalized olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (Ni@COF1) outperforms its reduced analog (Ni@COF1R) in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven halide exchange reactions. This robust catalyst exhibits high efficiency and broad functional group compatibility and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse drug scaffolds. 








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;decorated pyrene&#8208; and bipyridine&#8208;based olefin&#8208;linked COF (Ni@COF1) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre&#8208;installed Ni(II) centers.

&lt;p&gt;Ni@COF1-Catalyzed Finkelstein and retro-Finkelstein reactions are reported! Comparative studies reveal that a nickel-functiontionalized olefin-linked covalent organic framework (Ni@COF1) outperforms its reduced analog (Ni@COF1R) in visible-light-driven halide exchange reactions. This robust catalyst exhibits high efficiency and broad functional group compatibility and enables late-stage functionalization of diverse drug scaffolds. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel-decorated pyrene- and bipyridine-based olefin-linked COF (&lt;b&gt;Ni@COF1&lt;/b&gt;) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible-light-driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro-Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;-conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre-installed Ni(II) centers. Compared to its reduced counterpart (&lt;b&gt;Ni@COF1R&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;b&gt;Ni@COF1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late-stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram-scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number &amp;gt;850. These results highlight the significance of olefin-linked COFs in advancing sustainable photocatalysis and expanding their role in fine chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Is a Malleable Active Site Loop the Key to High Substrate Promiscuity? Hybrid, Biocatalytic Route to Structurally Diverse Taxoid Side Chains with Remarkable Dual Stereocontrol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective, dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) entry into myriad Taxotere&#8208;like side chains with Clostridium acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase (CaADH) enzyme is reported. Follow&#8208;on cross couplings expand the structural diversity of the library (36 total examples). The first X&#8208;ray structure of CaADH (1.39&#160;&#197;) reveals both a cofactor anti&#8594;syn &#8220;on/off switch&#8221; and a remarkably flexible loop that is modeled by molecular dynamics simulation.








Abstract
These studies reveal the first structure of Clostridium acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase (CaADH), a protein exhibiting remarkable substrate promiscuity and stereochemical fidelity. The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxotere family of tubulin&#8208;binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters, showing high D&#8208;syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant milataxel (Ar&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;furyl) and simotaxel (Ar&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross&#8208;coupling chemistries performed on the p&#8208;bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti&#8208;conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an (S)&#8208;configured C&#9472;Cl bond, in addition to the D&#8208;facial selectivity, demonstrated across 20 diverse substrates by this remarkable short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase enzyme.

         <title>A Guest Cation Screening Principle for Enabling Customized Cathode/Electrolyte Interface Chemistry and Self&#8208;Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural instability and slow reaction kinetics restrict the application of MnO2 cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This research proposes a guest cation screening principle, identifying Sr2+ as the promising intercalation ion. As demonstrated, it enables in situ forming customized SrSO4 CEI that suppresses Mn dissolution and boosts the de&#8208;solvation of hydrated zinc ions, yet stabilizes the MnO2 host structure.








Abstract
Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO2 cathode in high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high&#8208;efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de&#8208;solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self&#8208;optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr&#8208;MnO2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A g&#8722;1), better rate capability (115&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A g&#8722;1), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2&#160;A g&#8722;1, when compared with pure &#948;&#8208;MnO2 electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.

         <title>Progressive Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Single&#8208;Atom Metal Oxide Catalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a progressive learning framework that integrates DFT and machine learning to enhance prediction accuracy and sensitivity for rare, high&#8208;performance OER catalysts. By iteratively learning adsorption energies as auxiliary features, the model overcomes limitations of traditional scaling relationships and identifies top&#8208;performing single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped metal oxides. Experimental validation confirms the predicted activity and durability of MnSA&#8208;RuO2.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high&#8208;activity candidates. High&#8208;throughput screening of 261 transition metal single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped metal oxides (MSA&#8208;MOx) identified nine top&#8208;performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential&#160;&lt;&#160;0.5&#160;V), including MnSA&#8208;RuO2 and FeSA&#8208;TiO2 (theoretical overpotential&#160;&lt;&#160;0.3&#160;V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant&#8208;potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of MnSA&#8208;RuO2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, ML prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Layered Heterostructure Enables Reversible Oxygen Redox in Lithium Manganese Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered lithium manganese oxide with spinel heterostructures (LMO&#8208;SH) was prepared via a novel synthetic method. It has lithium&#8208;rich local environments and exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities, distinct from the conventional Li2MnO3. The spinel heterostructure provides extra Li+ pathways to activate the bulk activity and traps oxygen molecules (O2) for reversible reduction.

Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), primarily due to their exceptional capacity originating from oxygen redox chemistry. Although Li2MnO3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox&#8208;active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural&#8208;engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel&#8208;layered heterostructures (designated as LMO&#8208;SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O2&#8722;) and molecular oxygen (O2) &#8211; the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese&#8208;based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li+ diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO&#8208;based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high&#8208;capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Indium Single&#8208;Atom Sites Anchored on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Single&#8208;Layer Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 Into Formic Acid</title>

A single low&#8208;coordination indium(III) site anchored on a metal&#8208;organic framework can simultaneously bind and convert two carbon dioxide molecules into two formate products.








Abstract
The electroreduction of CO2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. Herein, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of a single&#8208;layer zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted as Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH&#160;=&#160;1.67) at&#160;&#8722;1.8&#160;V versus RHE, the Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The system maintains operational stability over 20&#160;h without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid&#8208;state electrolyte at 4&#160;V full&#8208;cell voltage, Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1, 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5&#8208;fold higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: i) the low&#8208;coordinated In(III) single&#8208;atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single&#8208;intermediate adsorption on high&#8208;coordination metal centers; and ii) the single&#8208;layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Conditional Stabilization of the Hypoxia&#8208;Inducible Factor HIF1&#945;&#8212; Photoswitchable Stapled Peptides Prevent Elongin BC&#8211;Mediated Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light photoswitchable peptides enable the stabilization of the hydroxylated hypoxia transcription factor 1&#945; (HIF1&#945;&#8212;OH) by targeting the pVHL&#8208;EloBC interaction. Significant differences in conformation, binding, and transcription of HIF&#8208;targeted genes between the photostationary states (PSS) were demonstrated.








Abstract
Oxygen levels and its distribution are tightly regulated due to their critical impact on health. Hypoxia&#8208;inducible factors (HIFs) are traditionally recognized as key regulators of the transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia). Recent research expanded their functions, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, there is still a need for chemical biology tools that offer precise spatiotemporal control within the HIF network and output. Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1&#945;&#8208;target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PSB&#8208;BCB&#8208;04 stabilized HIF1&#945; under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC (ki&#160; = &#160;7.9&#160;&#177;&#160;1.3&#160;nM) and preventing VHL&#8208;mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a sevenfold difference in its EloBC&#8208;binding capacity. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1&#945; degradation enabled isomer&#8208;specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1&#945; and provided a new toolbox for on&#8208;demand photocontrol over the HIF&#8208;signaling pathway as well as VHL&#8208;mediated degradation.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Plant Polyphenols Into Amorphous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phenolic&#8208;mediated molecular splicing and ring&#8208;locking strategy enables the fabrication of amorphous RTP systems with lifetimes up to 124&#160;ms. The resulting phosphorescent nanoparticles exhibit exceptional biocompatibility, enabling high&#8208;contrast, time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging, offering a sustainable approach for biomedical RTP applications.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have potential applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging but encounter significant challenges. Traditional heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based and crystalline systems are often toxic and environmentally sensitive, while strategies involving host&#8211;guest doping and encapsulation frequently suffer from phase separation and limited controllability&#8212;ultimately resulting in poor repeatability and restricted applications. Here, we developed a novel polyphenol&#8208;mediated molecular splicing and ring&#8208;locking strategy to incorporate benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BZT) into polyphenol molecules, yielding a range of eco&#8208;friendly and processable amorphous single&#8208;component systems with a lifetime of up to 124&#160;ms. Experimental and calculational analyses confirm that phosphorescence arises from synergistic interactions between polyphenol and BZT. Furthermore, phosphorescent nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via nanoprecipitation in tetrahydrofuran with 30% water content. These well&#8208;dispersed, metal&#8208;free NPs demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, facilitating time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging with minimal background fluorescence interference both in vitro and in vivo. This research establishes a versatile and sustainable design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance amorphous RTP materials using plant polyphenols, offering promising prospects for advanced biomedical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Hydrogen Oxidation for Hydroxide Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Catalyzed by Fivefold&#8208;Twinned Nickel Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fivefold&#8208;twinned nickel (Ni) nanoparticles exhibit a pronounced pull&#8208;up strain near the twin boundary (TB), with a gradual increase in the strain effect near the TB. The fivefold&#8208;twinned nanoparticles demonstrate an increased hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) and stable hydrogen binding energy (HBE) at the TB due to the strain effect, generating abundant and highly active sites in proximity to the TB. Special strain effect plays a crucial role in accelerating the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) process.








Abstract
The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer&#8211;N&#248;rskov d&#8208;band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold&#8208;twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity.

&lt;p&gt;The fivefold-twinned nickel (Ni) nanoparticles exhibit a pronounced pull-up strain near the twin boundary (TB), with a gradual increase in the strain effect near the TB. The fivefold-twinned nanoparticles demonstrate an increased hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) and stable hydrogen binding energy (HBE) at the TB due to the strain effect, generating abundant and highly active sites in proximity to the TB. Special strain effect plays a crucial role in accelerating the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer&#8211;N&#248;rskov d-band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold-twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;k,m&lt;/sub&gt; value of 106.6&#160;mA mg&lt;sub&gt;Ni&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with fivefold-twinned Ni nanoparticles anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas feed, which is the highest among Ni-based electrocatalysts reported thus far. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits excellent&#160;long-term&#160;cycling&#160;performance, taking a giant step forward toward the commercialization of platinum group metal (PGM)-free HEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation platform has been developed for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines. In contrast to natural NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent C&#9552;N bond reductases, this strategy employs carbonic anhydrase or P450 as a catalyst in combination with a silane&#8208;reducing agent, offering a fully orthogonal alternative to conventional NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent cellular processes.








Abstract
Chiral amines are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic catalysts. Their increasing demand has driven the advancement of synthetic methods. In this study, we developed a metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method for the synthesis of chiral amines. Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent C&#9552;N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent cellular functions. This reactivity highlights the potential to develop new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic functions capable of addressing challenges in both organic synthesis and biosynthesis.

         <title>Amplifying Circularly Polarized Luminescence with High Dissymmetry Factor over 10&#8722;2 Based on Robust Point Chirality Triptycene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of triptycene&#8208;bridged enantiomers with a robust point chirality and a donor&#8211;acceptor architecture were developed as direct emitters, donors of exciplex emitters, and exciplex hosts for circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs), respectively. The corresponding dissymmetry factor was sequentially amplified. Remarkably, the CP&#8208;OLED achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 31.8% and a dissymmetry factor of 2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2.








Abstract
Chiral organic luminescent materials are promising candidates as direct emitting layers (EMLs) in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). However, most conventional systems suffered poor thermal stability of chiral configurations and low luminescent dissymmetry factors. Herein, we reported a pair of triptycene&#8208;bridged enantiomers with a point chirality and a donor&#8211;acceptor architecture. Robust point chirality, originating from quaternary bridgehead&#8208;carbons, prevented the common racemization during thermal sublimation. Thanks to the reduced electric transition dipole moment (&#181;e) in donor&#8211;acceptor architecture, tuned parallel alignment between the further reduced &#181;e and magnetic transition dipole moment (&#181;m) in the exciplex emitter, and the utilized chiral exciplex host for energy transfer to phosphor, the corresponding dissymmetry factors of emitters were sequentially amplified from 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 to 4.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, and to 8.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. Remarkably, the CP&#8208;OLED device simultaneously achieved outstanding electroluminescence performance with a high external quantum efficiency of 31.8% and a large dissymmetry factor of 2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. This work provided a viable pathway for developing high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLED materials through synergistic structural, material, and device engineering.

Abstract
Ni&#8208;based inverse catalysts with nano&#8208;oxide dispersed on metallic substrates have emerged as promising candidates for low&#8208;temperature CO2 methanation, but it remains challenging in facile synthesis of well&#8208;dispersed oxide&#8208;metal interactions. Herein, a spontaneous oxide exsolution strategy for the fabrication of Ni&#8208;based inverse catalyst via monodispersed Zr species of Ni&#8208;Zr&#8208;O mixed oxide is demonstrated, where precisely tailored calcination and reduction of the mixed oxide enable in situ nano&#8208;ZrO2 segregation on the metallic Ni matrix. The formation evolution of inverse configuration is elucidated through comprehensive ex situ/in situ characterizations. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the electron transfer between the exsolved ZrO2 and the Ni matrix, indicating the presence of metal&#8208;oxide interactions. The prepared ZrO2/Ni inverse catalyst achieves &#8764;90% CO2 conversion and&#160;&gt;99% CH4 selectivity at low&#8208;temperature of 200 &#176;C, and also demonstrates excellent catalytic performance and dynamic operational stability in complex COx hydrogenation reactions, validating its industrial applicability under realistic syngas&#8208;equivalent feedstock conditions.

         <title>Isotope Engineering of Tetraphenylethylene: Aggregate&#8208;Dependent Enhancement of Luminescence Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends the fluorescence lifetimes of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances intermode coupling and internal conversion.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE&#8208;5d, TPE&#8208;10d, and TPE&#8208;20d), combined with steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter&#8208;mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE&#8208;20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure&#8211;property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.

&lt;p&gt;In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends the fluorescence lifetimes of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances intermode coupling and internal conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE-5d, TPE-10d, and TPE-20d), combined with steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter-mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE-20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure&#8211;property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Protected Organozirconium Catalyzes C&#9472;H Alumination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#9472;H alumination of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons is catalyzed by surface&#8208;grafted organozirconium species, with high selectivity for the least&#8208;hindered, terminal position, enabled by selective silylation of a small number of residual silanols in the catalyst. Exclusive mono&#8208;alumination of methane is accomplished with more than 70 turnovers. 








Abstract
Surface grafted organozirconium catalyzes C&#9472;H/Et&#9472;Al exchange reactions, involving saturated hydrocarbons and AlEt3, to afford organoaluminum compounds and ethane. The Zr(OtBu)3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8211;700 (1) catalyst contains monopodal &#8801;SiO&#9472;Zr(OtBu)3 and only a few residual silanols (&lt;5%). Nonetheless, these silanols are the Achille's heel of 1, providing a pathway for surface and catalyst degradation during catalysis, limiting the alkylaluminum yield and catalyst turnover. Support degradation, involving the cleavage of Si&#9472;O bonds by activated surface organometallics, is inhibited by capping silanols with &#9472;SiMe3. Residual silanols in 1 react with allyltrimethylsilane, as determined by solid&#8208;state 13C and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and reaction stoichiometry, to form Zr(OtBu)3/SiMe3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8211;700 (2), which is resistant to degradation by AlEt3. C&#9472;H alumination of dodecane catalyzed by 2 produces higher yields of the 1&#8208;dodecylaluminum product in comparison to 1, and in &gt;95% selectivity. Additionally, methane undergoes 2&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H alumination, providing a route to AlMe3.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Tetrabenzylphosphonium Groups as Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Artificial Anion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mitochondriotropic artificial anion channels have been constructed from a self&#8208;assembled tetrabenzylphosphonium framework with an inherent ability to autonomously target mitochondria. Anion transport is mediated by multiple intermolecular C&#9472;H&#8943;anion H&#9472;bonds and electrostatic ion pair interactions. The highly efficient transmembrane anion transport is demonstrated by low micromolar anticancer activity against three cancer cell lines.








Abstract
Artificial ion channels with specific organelle&#8208;targeting capabilities have been scarcely investigated. Here, we report the first&#8208;in&#8208;class mitochondria&#8208;targeting anion channels derived from a structurally simple tetrabenzylphosphonium framework, in stark contrast to its phenyl&#8208;based counterpart, which lacks anion transport activity. Structural and computational analyses underscore the critical role of the methylene (CH2) linkers in the benzyl groups. These CH2 units reduce positive charge delocalization to enhance &#963;&#8208;hole&#8211;anion interactions, while also enabling H&#8208;atoms from both the CH2 linkers and aromatic rings to cooperatively form multiple C&#9472;H&#8943;anion H&#9472;bonds. In further conjunction with the rigid benzene rings, they help create sufficient spatial voids to accommodate anion translocation, collectively facilitating and energizing the anion transport process. Among the series studied, those bearing methyl and tert&#8208;butyl substituents exhibit the highest transport activity via a channel mechanism, with a conductance value as high as 26.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8&#160;pS. Furthermore, leveraging the cationic nature of the quaternary phosphonium center, this family of anion channels readily achieves targeted mitochondrial localization, demonstrating potent anticancer activity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.42 to 3.04&#160;&#181;M across three cancer cell lines.

         <title>Cooperative Activation of CO and Pyridine by an Aluminum(I) Complex Ligated with a Silylene&#8211;Borane Ligand</title>

A silylene&#8211;borane&#8208;ligated aluminum(I) complex featuring Si(II)&#8594;Al(I) and Al(I)&#8594;B(III) donor&#8211;acceptor interactions were synthesized and structurally characterized. The ambiphilic ligand&#8208; aluminum cooperation enables C&#8801;O bond cleavage and pyridine dearomatization, uncovering new avenues in low&#8208;valent aluminum chemistry.








Abstract
Cooperative main&#8208;group systems based on alumylenes are highly attractive due to their potential for activating and transforming inert chemical bonds and small molecules. However, their development has been hindered by the scarcity of suitable supporting ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis of an amphiphilic carboranyl silylene&#8211;borane ligand (1) and demonstrate its effectiveness in stabilizing an aluminum(I) complex 2. Complex 2 has been unambiguously characterized by spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations, which reveals a unique structure featuring both silicon(II)&#8594;aluminum(I) and aluminum(I)&#8594;boron(III) donor&#8211;acceptor bonds. The synergistic interplay between the silylene&#8211;borane ligand and the aluminum(I) center in 2 drives its unusual reactivity toward CO and pyridine activation, facilitating cleavage of the C&#8801;O bond and dearomatization of pyridine.

         <title>Donor Engineering for High Performance n&#8208;Type OECT Materials with Exceptional Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor engineering with 2,3&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)fumaronitrile (DTFMCN) enables high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) polymers (S/B&#8208;DTFMCN). These materials achieve ultra&#8208;low threshold voltages and long&#8208;term operational stability, alongside efficient ion&#8208;electron transport. The study confirms that tailored donor design optimizes electrochemical stability and device longevity, demonstrating donor engineering as a key strategy for robust n&#8208;type OECTs with balanced performance and durability.








Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (PMIECs) have been widely used in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their structural diversity and the tunability of their frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels. However, the slower development of n&#8208;type materials compared to p&#8208;type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene&#8208;based donor building block, 2,3&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)fumaronitrile (DTFMCN), for D&#8211;A conjugated n&#8208;type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. DTFMCN can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one&#8208;step process. The DTFMCN&#8208;based D&#8211;A conjugated polymers, S&#8208;DTFMCN and B&#8208;DTFMCN, exhibit extremely low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n&#8208;type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra&#8208;low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high &#181;C* values of 13.49 and 13.57&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n&#8208;type OECT devices reported to date.

&lt;p&gt;Donor engineering with 2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)fumaronitrile (&lt;b&gt;DTFMCN)&lt;/b&gt; enables high-performance n-type organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) polymers (&lt;b&gt;S/B-DTFMCN&lt;/b&gt;). These materials achieve ultra-low threshold voltages and long-term operational stability, alongside efficient ion-electron transport. The study confirms that tailored donor design optimizes electrochemical stability and device longevity, demonstrating donor engineering as a key strategy for robust n-type OECTs with balanced performance and durability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (PMIECs) have been widely used in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their structural diversity and the tunability of their frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels. However, the slower development of n-type materials compared to p-type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene-based donor building block, 2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)fumaronitrile (&lt;b&gt;DTFMCN&lt;/b&gt;), for D&#8211;A conjugated n-type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. &lt;b&gt;DTFMCN&lt;/b&gt; can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one-step process. The DTFMCN-based D&#8211;A conjugated polymers, &lt;b&gt;S-DTFMCN&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;B-DTFMCN&lt;/b&gt;, exhibit extremely low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n-type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra-low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high &#181;&lt;i&gt;C*&lt;/i&gt; values of 13.49 and 13.57&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n-type OECT devices reported to date. This study highlights the effectiveness of &lt;b&gt;DTFMCN&lt;/b&gt; in improving the operational stability of n-type OECT devices, offering promising potential for applications in bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom Pore Engineering in Carbon Molecular Sieves Realizes Diffusion&#8208;Gated Kinetic Sieving of Alkenes from Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom engineering of slit&#8208;pore carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) enables diffusion&#8208;gated kinetic sieving of alkenes over alkanes. The optimized CMSs exhibit high alkene/alkane selectivity, low co&#8208;adsorption, and near&#8208;complete alkene recovery in pressure swing adsorption (PSA) operations, establishing a practical route for energy&#8208;efficient alkene purifications.








Abstract
Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom pore engineering offers a new paradigm for molecular separations. Here, we report sucrose&#8208;derived carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) with precisely tailored sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom slit pores that enable diffusion&#8208;gated kinetic sieving for the challenging separation of alkenes from alkanes. The optimized materials, C&#8208;Suc&#8208;650 and C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750, set new industry&#8208;leading standards for the kinetic separation of C3H6/C3H8 and C2H4/C2H6, respectively. Through a combination of breakthrough experiments, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) modeling, we demonstrate that these sieves consistently achieve &gt;99.9% alkene purity, with outstanding selectivity, rapid uptake kinetics, and remarkably low energy consumption. Mechanistic studies reveal that slit pore architecture uniquely enhances alkene diffusion while hindering alkane movement, establishing a clear design principle for next&#8208;generation, energy&#8208;efficient gas separations. These results provide a blueprint for exploiting diffusion&#8208;gated kinetic sieving at the sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom scale to address longstanding challenges in industrial gas purification.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Sided Multidentate Coordination Strategy Enables Record Birefringence in UV&#8208;Transparent Antimony&#8208;Based Hybrid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;shaped UV&#8208;transparent hybrid birefringence crystal, (C10H6NO2)2SbF (QCSF), with a record&#8208;breaking birefringence of 0.87 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported halide birefringent crystals with SCALPs, was successfully designed and synthesized through a dual&#8208;sided multidentate coordination strategy.








Abstract
Achieving ultrahigh birefringence in UV&#8208;transparent materials remains fundamentally constrained by the trade&#8208;off between strong optical anisotropy and wide bandgap transparency. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly&#8208;shaped UV organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals&#8212;(C6H4NO2)2SbF (PCSF) and (C10H6NO2)2SbF (QCSF)&#8212;in which planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record&#8208;high birefringence of &#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.87 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported lone&#8208;pair&#8208;containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN2O2F] coordination geometry, near&#8208;planar molecular configuration, and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next&#8208;generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.

         <title>A Homobimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Cobalt Catalyst for the Methanolysis of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] shows excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, reaching TOF values of ca. 50&#160;000&#160;h&#8722;1. This behavior can be ascribed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which allows for a frustrated Lewis pair mechanism, resulting in a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond, as substantiated by DFT calculations. 








Abstract
The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (1) has shown excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, surpassing the related bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)(PMe2Ph)(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (2), the Co(II) complex [Co(Cl)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)] (3), and the Co(I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)]Cl (4). A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PNHP ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(&#8211;I) centers. Then, the PhSiH2 group at the Co(&#8211;I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ cation, regenerating the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; species. [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH&#8208;assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.

         <title>Engineering PdAu/CeO2 Alloy/Oxide Interfaces for Selective Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>

Selective methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion at 500&#160;K over Pd0.3Au0.7/CeO2. The synergistic interaction between alloyed Pd&#8211;Au sites and the CeO2 support enhances catalytic performance, enabling highly selective methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol under mild conditions. The reaction of CH4 with H2O produces CH3OH and H2, achieving &#8764;80% selectivity under mild conditions while maintaining stable long&#8208;term activity.








Abstract
The direct conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol remains a critical challenge in methane valorization. In this study, we unveil the crucial role of PdAu/CeO2 catalysts in enabling selective methane transformation under mild conditions, using only water as the sole oxidant. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including XPS and catalytic testing, alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that a Pd0.3Au0.7/CeO2 catalyst, which predominantly exposes isolated Pd atoms, achieves remarkable methanol selectivity (&#8764;80%) at 500&#160;K with a 1:1 methane&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. While Pd/CeO2 efficiently activates methane, its tendency for overreaction leads to complete methanol decomposition, thereby limiting selectivity. Alloying Pd with Au on ceria mitigates this over&#8208;reactivity, preventing methanol degradation while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity. The PdAu/CeO2 composite exhibits a synergistic effect: Pd in contact with the ceria support facilitates methane activation and water dissociation, while Au fine&#8208;tunes reactivity to promote methanol formation. DFT calculations confirm that isolated Pd sites at the PdAu/CeO2 interface play a key role in balancing activity and selectivity. This work underscores the importance of alloy/oxide interfaces in controlling selective methane conversion with water and offers valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Bathing Strategy with Ultra&#8208;Wide Processing Window for Making High&#8208;efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent bathing strategy with ultra&#8208;wide processing window (10 s&#8211;10&#160;min) is proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The bathing process is in situ monitored via time&#8208;resolved UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, systematically unrevealing the crystallization kinetics for different antisolvents. The PCE of CF&#8208;bathed device achieves 24.49% in ambient air, representing the record for antisolvent bathing method.








Abstract
Most record&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin&#8208;coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during R2R fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed the antisolvent&#8208;bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent&#8208;antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in&#8208;situ crystallization monitoring via time&#8208;resolved UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30%&#8211;50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by the antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256&#160;h storage in N2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied by an ultra&#8208;wide processing window (10&#160;s&#8211;10&#160;min bathing duration, &gt;2&#160;min post&#8208;bathing delay tolerance).

         <title>Calix[8]Arene&#8208;Tethered Dendritic Octamer Acceptor with Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Enables 20.7% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Exceptional Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A calix[8]arene&#8208;tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a well&#8208;defined structure and molecular weight of 14243 g mol&#8722;1 is developed and utilized as an electron acceptor in organic solar cells. The dendritic architecture facilitates efficient charge transport, tunable crystallinity, and optimized charge dynamics, resulting in a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 18.7% in binary devices and 20.7% in ternary devices, along with outstanding device stability.








Abstract
Increasing the molecular weight of the acceptor is an effective strategy to suppress excessive crystallization and molecular diffusion, thereby addressing morphological challenges in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, designing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptors with well&#8208;defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene&#8208;tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243&#160;g mol&#8722;1 and a well&#8208;defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8&#8208;IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8&#8208;BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature (Tg), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high&#8208;performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Mono&#8208;Coordinated Triplet Bismuthinidene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydrogenation of Ar*BiH2 3 yielded the kinetically stabilized mono&#8208;coordinated triplet bismuthinidene 4, which was structurally characterized by sc&#8208;XRD and whose electronic character was analyzed by quantum chemical calculations. Bismuthinidene 4 reacts with alkyl halides with oxidative addition to bismuthanes Ar*Bi(R)X, which react with LiAlH4 to the corresponding room temperature&#8208;stable bismuthanes Ar*Bi(R)H.








Abstract
The triplet bismuthinidene Ar*Bi (4) stabilized by a very bulky septiphenyl ligand (Ar* = 3,5&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2&#8208;2,6&#8208;(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;3,5&#8208;(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)2&#8211;C6H)&#8211;C6H) was synthesized by dehydrogenation of in situ formed bismuth dihydride Ar*BiH2 (3). Oxidative addition reactions of 4 with alkyl halides (MeI, EtBr, i&#8208;PrBr) yielded bismuthanes Ar*Bi(Me)I (5), Ar*Bi(Et)Br (6), and Ar*Bi(i&#8208;Pr)Br (7), which reacted with LiAlH4 and LiAlD4 to the thermally robust bismuth monohydrides Ar*Bi(R)H (R&#160;=&#160;Me 8, Et 10, i&#8208;Pr 12) and monodeuterides Ar*Bi(R)D (R&#160;=&#160;Me 9, Et 11, i&#8208;Pr 13). Ar*Bi(NMe2)2 1 and Ar*BiH2 3 were characterized in situ by 1H NMR spectroscopy and sc&#8208;XRD (1), whereas the other compounds were characterized by heteronuclear NMR (1H/2H (D), 13C) and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis (Ar*&#8208;2, Ar*&#8208;3, Ar*&#8208;5, Ar*&#8208;7, Ar*I, Ar*H, 2, 4&#8722;7), as well as by UV&#8211;vis (4) and sc&#8208;XRD (Ar*&#8208;7, Ar*I, Ar*Li&#183;Lit&#8208;Bu, Ar*H, 1, 2, 4, 12). Quantum chemical calculations revealed the triplet character of the bismuthinidine 4.

&lt;p&gt;The triplet bismuthinidene Ar*Bi (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) stabilized by a very bulky septiphenyl ligand (Ar* = 3,5-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-2,6-(2,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-3,5-(2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H)&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H) was synthesized by dehydrogenation of in situ formed bismuth dihydride Ar*BiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Oxidative addition reactions of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with alkyl halides (MeI, EtBr, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-PrBr) yielded bismuthanes Ar*Bi(Me)I (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), Ar*Bi(Et)Br (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), and Ar*Bi(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)Br (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), which reacted with LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and LiAlD&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to the thermally robust bismuth monohydrides Ar*Bi(R)H (R&#160;=&#160;Me &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;, Et &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;) and monodeuterides Ar*Bi(R)D (R&#160;=&#160;Me &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, Et &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;). Ar*Bi(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and Ar*BiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; were characterized in situ by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy and sc-XRD (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), whereas the other compounds were characterized by heteronuclear NMR (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H (D), &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis (&lt;b&gt;Ar*-2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*-3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*-5&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*-7&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*I&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*H&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), as well as by UV&#8211;vis (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and sc-XRD (&lt;b&gt;Ar*-7&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*I&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*Li&#183;Li&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ar*H&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;).

         <title>Precision Screening and Surgical Resection of Pan&#8208;Cancer Using a Tandem&#8208;Locked NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probe with Optimized Activation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic cyanine&#8208;based NIR II fluorescent probe, ACy&#8208;H&#8208;NTR, employs a &#8220;tandem&#8208;locked and doubly quenched&#8221; strategy combined with an &#8220;interstitial activation&#8211;lysosome retention&#8221; mechanism, enabling high&#8208;precision pan&#8208;cancer imaging and surgical resection. 








Abstract
The development of fluorescent probes for cancer detection and imaging that balance high sensitivity, precision, and broad applicability remains a significant challenge. Although &#8220;dual&#8208;locked&#8221; probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan&#8208;cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy&#8208;H&#8208;NTR, a cascaded&#8208;activation, doubly quenched NIR&#8208;II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity&#8212;universal tumor hallmarks&#8212;it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan&#8208;cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem&#8208;locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan&#8208;tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR&#8208;II emission and &#8220;activation&#8211;retention&#8221; mechanism enhance tumor imaging efficacy and effectively tackle issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan&#8208;cancer models, it enabled high&#8208;contrast imaging (T/N &#8764;7.8) and precise resection with sub&#8208;2&#160;mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem&#8208;locked and doubly quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR&#8208;II imaging capabilities, and activation&#8208;retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan&#8208;cancer identification and surgical navigation.

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;Assembled Liquid Crystal Polymer Network Enabled by In&#8208;Situ Photopolymerization for High&#8208;Performance CP&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 36, September 1, 2025. </description>

This work developed a facile in situ photopolymerization approach to construct rigid cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (ChLC&#8208;PN) as the emitting layers (EML) for CP&#8208;OLEDs through chiral co&#8208;assembly strategy in cholesteric liquid crystal matrices.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation display technologies. However, achieving high dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) in circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we construct a novel chiral co&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (ChLC&#8208;PN) as an emitting layer (EML) to enhance CP&#8208;EL via a facile in situ photopolymerization strategy. The ChLC&#8208;PN was fabricated by UV&#8208;induced polymerization (365&#160;nm, 200&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 2&#160;min, N&#8322; atmosphere) of a chiral co&#8208;assembly system comprising liquid crystal monomer (LCM) and chiral inducers (R/S&#8208;Cz). Notably, the resulting (R/S&#8208;Cz)0.01&#8208;(LCP)0.99 based devices demonstrate sky&#8208;blue CP&#8208;EL with a maximum |gEL| value of 0.012. This work presents the first report of high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs utilizing a chiral co&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystal rigid polymer network, offering a promising platform for simple, stable, and scalable fabrication of future CP&#8208;OLED devices.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Protein Complex Stability Controls Substrate Scope in a &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase Specific for Medium Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;ACP complex stability can control substrate preference. Molecular simulations of (top) EcFabG bound to &#946;&#8208;ketobutyryl&#8208;ACP show salt bridges that are not present when (bottom) PpFabG4 binds to the same substrate. EcFabG is active on all chain lengths, but PpFabG4 prefers long chains, which stabilize the enzyme&#8211;ACP complex. By adding stabilizing mutations (red to blue), we can increase its activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Assembly&#8208;line enzymes carry out multistep synthesis of important metabolites by using acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to shuttle intermediates along defined sequences of active sites. Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida (PpFabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short&#8208;chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme&#8211;ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for PpFabG4 or weaken it for EcFabG, an Escherichia coli &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme&#8208;ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly&#8208;line systems.

         <title>Origin and Suppression of Intragranular Cracks for Long&#8208;Cycling High&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;Free Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are found to be widely distributed in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free (NM) cathodes, and the relation between APBs gain boundaries and intragranular cracks has been established for the first time. Additionally, a charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy is proposed to reduce the formation of APBs and optimize the generation/distribution of internal stresses, thereby suppressing intragranular cracks. 








Abstract
Intragranular cracks have been identified as a direct reflection of failure in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes, especially for high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes with severe electrochemical&#8211;mechanical degradation. Here we show that antiphase boundaries (APBs) are prone to form in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes and demonstrate their crucial role in determining the formation of intragranular cracks. The results show that the APBs grain boundaries are continuously expand during the electrochemical process, and their presence promotes the formation and accumulation of heterogeneous internal stresses within the layered structure, which in turn facilitates the nucleation and expansion of intragranular cracks. We further show that an elaborate charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy can inhibit APBs, which not only maintains the electronic equilibrium of the oxygen framework, but also the synergistic effect of double&#8208;site modification can exhibit a &#8220;lattice&#8208;locking&#8221; effect, leading to an ordered layered structure. The present work suppresses intragranular cracks by eliminating APBs grain boundaries, and this understanding provides insights for developing long&#8208;cycling high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes.

         <title>Creating Abundant Open Metal Sites in MOFs by Dual&#8208;Coordination Design for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coordination strategy is developed to create abundant unsaturated metal sites in MOFs while preserving their crystalline framework, enabling precise structure&#8211;property studies and enhanced electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined crystalline structures offer ideal platforms to unravel structure&#8211;property relationships, but their low density of accessible metal sites limits catalytic activation. Efforts to generate open metal sites often compromise structural integrity, obstructing mechanistic investigation. In this study, we convert single&#8208;coordinated MOFs into dual&#8208;coordinated frameworks, enabling controlled creation of unsaturated metal sites to boost electrocatalytic performance while preserving crystal framework for structure&#8211;property study. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we transform Zn&#9472;N single&#8208;coordinated ZIF&#8208;L into Zn&#9472;N/O dual&#8208;coordinated MOFs (B&#8208;MOFs), where strong Zn&#9472;N bonds act as structural pillars and weaker Zn&#9472;O bonds serve as removable linkers. Upon annealing at 500&#160;&#176;C, selective cleavage of Zn&#9472;O bonds produces defective MOFs (dB&#8208;MOFs) with abundant open Zn sites and a well&#8208;retained crystal structure. The dB&#8208;MOF grown on carbon cloth (CC) exhibits high performance in hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), significantly superior to pristine B&#8208;MOF/CC. A combination of material characterizations and theoretical calculation demonstrates that the removal of Zn&#9472;O bond creates abundant electron&#8208;deficient Zn sites, which enhance the adsorption of HzOR intermediates and lower the reaction energy barriers.

         <dc:description>
Molecular sieving of xylene isomers was achieved by Myoung Soo Lah et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202512244), using a pillar&#8208;layered MOF, Ni&#8208;HDB, incorporating DABCO pillars that block lateral diffusion and enforce transport through elliptical windows. This confined geometry enables record selectivity for PX and EB over OX via kinetic sieving, offering a new strategy for energy&#8208;efficient hydrocarbon separation.

H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation serves as an effective chemical driven force for achieving the Li2+xNHFx&#8211;LiF solid electrolyte from LiH and NH4F precursor, which enables the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to the accelerated Li&#8208;ion migration in Li2+xNHFx, favorable in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphase at the electrode surface and the enhanced mechanical strengths.








Abstract
Nitride family compounds are among the earliest explored materials for solid electrolytes (SEs). The main challenge lies in effectively enhancing their electrochemical stability without compromising their excellent Li&#8208;ion conductivity and Li metal compatibility. Herein, a H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation reaction between LiH and NH4F is employed to synthesize a Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex, consisting of Li2+xNHFx matrix and dispersed LiF nanoparticles. Density functional calculation results show that the incorporated F atoms in Li2NH lattice lead to structural variation and electron density redistribution, providing a more connected Li&#8208;ion network with low migration energy barriers. More importantly, the interfacial side reactions between the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex and electrodes are strongly self&#8208;limited due to the blocking effect of the in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphases. The newly identified interphase Li4NH exhibits fast Li&#8208;ion migration ability and intrinsic stability toward Li, facilitating stable Li plating/stripping. Based on the superiority in Li&#8208;ion conduction and electrode compatibility, the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F solid electrolyte films prepared via cold pressing with 0.5 wt% binder enable stable cycling of Li||Li, Li||TiS2, and Li||LiCoO2 all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Multisite Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Facilitates Oxidative Photocatalysis in a Molecular Zr&#8208;Based Coordination Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing multisite proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) through deprotonation of a photoactive Zr coordination cage unlocks oxidative photocatalysis of strong C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. This reactivity overcomes the energetic barrier that renders electron transfer alone inaccessible. The Zr platform acts as an ambipolar mediator that unites oxidative and reductive PCET pathways, each operating through distinct mechanisms, and offers new insights for sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion, as reported by Pablo Garrido&#8208;Barros et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202510723).

         <title>Are Grignard Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents Interface&#8208;Driven?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and molecular dynamics studies of acetophenone, alongside a computational analysis of i&#8208;PrMgCl in a biphasic ChCl:2Gly DES/THF solution, offer valuable insights into the remarkable efficiency of the Grignard reaction under these conditions. The poorly soluble acetophenone interacts with the Grignard reagent at the interface of the two solvents, enhancing the probability of effective contact between the reagents.








Abstract
Due to their high reactivity, organolithium and organomagnesium addition to ketones is usually performed under inert atmosphere at low temperature. Recent work has shown that, by dissolving the substrate in deep eutectic solvents (DES), these processes can be carried out on the benchtop, in air at room temperature. Surprisingly, the organometallic reagent, added to the DES from an organic solution, works in these conditions and gives better yields than in the standard setup. Here, we investigated acetophenone in a (1:2) choline chloride:glycerol (ChCl:Gly) DES solution by experimental liquid diffraction, neutron reflectometry, NMR, interfacial tension measurements, and by computational modelling. Our data show that this DES is a poor solvent for the ketone and promotes its accumulation at the surface of the liquid or its escape into the organic solvent. Molecular dynamics simulations of Grignard reagent i&#8208;PrMgCl in the (ChCl:Gly)/tetrahydrofuran biphasic system indicate also preference for its localisation at the interface. These results pinpoint why this combination of solvents promote the reaction, require stirring, and accounts for the lack of rapid decomposition of the organometallic&#160;reagents.

In their Research Article (e202508481), Lenard Saile and Kun Dai et&#160;al. describe a feedback mechanism that controls non&#8208;equilibrium systems. Enantiomeric aminoacyl phosphates, depicted as left and right hands drive the formation of distinct peptide assemblies. These structures, in turn, regulate the kinetics of the reaction cycle, providing control through stereochemical information rather than broad structural changes.

         <title>Polymerization of L&#8208;Arginine into Nanomicelles for Immunometabolic Engineering of Adoptive Macrophages in Solid Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of regulating immunometabolism of adoptive macrophages in vivo is reported by synthesizing L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based polymeric nanomicelles and integrating them within macrophages (PLANO@M&#248;). PLANO@M&#248; could display augmented tumor&#8208;killing potential and induce robust immune response. In the 4T1 murine model, PLANO@M&#248; showed an obvious inhibition effect on tumor progression.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of adoptive cell therapy is highly dependent on the status and function of the infused cells. However, insufficient nutrient availability within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) often impedes these cells from fully exerting their cytotoxic potential against solid tumors. Here, we present a strategy of integrating adoptively transferred macrophages with intracellular nutrient depots composed of L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based nanomicelles to provide a sustainable supply of essential metabolite and optimize the cellular activity in the nutrient&#8208;deprived TME. Also, the nanomicelles were coated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles to endow them with immunomodulatory capability, which could activate macrophages toward anti&#8208;tumor phenotypes and resist immune suppression. We showed that our approach significantly strengthened the tumor&#8208;killing potential of macrophages, induced robust immune responses, and effectively inhibited solid tumor growth compared to the administration of an equal dose of macrophages without immunometabolic modulation. This work provides a method for orchestrating the behavior of transferred cells in vivo, offering a promising strategy to better unleash the potential of adoptive cell therapies against solid tumors.

         <title>A New Phase Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) Activated Selective CO2 Reduction into Formate for Underwater Antifouling Glass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D new&#8208;phase transparent conducting oxide: trigonal phase indium tin oxide (m&#8208;ITOs) was reported to achieve formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% and remained stable for more than 30&#160;h, exhibiting excellent antifouling behavior toward a new application in underwater antifouling windows. 








Abstract
Designing unique electrocatalysts that utilizes carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) for real applications is highly appreciated, yet still suffers from low selectivity, stability, and compatibility. Herein, we first report a new two&#8208;dimensional metastable&#8208;phase transparent conducting oxide: 1T phase indium tin oxide (m&#8208;ITOs) with the space group of P&#8722;3m1 (164), which is totally different from that of the stable cubic phase ITO (Ia&#8722;3 (206)). The internal indium tin catalytic pairs in m&#8208;ITOs trigger the strong electronic coupling, move up the p&#8208;band center, and stabilize the adsorption of HCOO* for increased formate production. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit a high CO2RR electrocatalytic performance with the formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% (83&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6% for In2O3/SnO2) and remains 97% (58% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 60% for In2O3/SnO2) of catalytic activity after a 120,000&#160;s stability test. Owing to the efficient formate formation with directly using the absorbed CO2 in water and high transparent property, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit excellent antifouling behavior of inhibiting Chlorella growth without reducing the transparency of itself, encouraging a promising application of observation windows in water.

         <title>Cationic&#8211;Zwitterionic Polymer Electrolytes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Lithium&#8208;Ion Selectivity for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic&#8211;zwitterionic polymers are developed to address the low ionic conductivity and lithium&#8208;ion selectivity of polymer electrolytes. Sulfonate moieties facilitate cation dissociation and transport, while cationic groups confine anions electrostatically, yielding a conductivity of 1.6&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a lithium transference number of 0.76. These electrolytes demonstrate high safety and enable Ah&#8208;level lithium&#8211;metal batteries.








Abstract
Polymer electrolytes are attractive for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;metal batteries owing to their favorable interfacial compatibility and scalable processability. However, the concurrent realization of high ionic conductivity and a high lithium&#8208;ion transference number remains a significant key challenge. Herein, we report a class of cationic&#8211;zwitterionic polymer electrolytes that simultaneously exhibit high ionic conductivity and enhanced lithium&#8208;ion selectivity. The cationic segments within the polymer networks immobilize anions to promote selective lithium&#8208;ion transport, while sulfonate groups facilitate effective lithium salt dissociation and ion mobility. Structural and electrochemical analyses verify the stability and performance of these electrolytes in lithium symmetric cells and Li||LiFePO4 batteries. Notably, a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell incorporating the optimized electrolyte validates the practical scalability and safety, highlighting its promise for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;metal batteries.

         <title>Dendritic Pillar[6]Arenes with Fixed Planar Chirality for Stereoselective Inclusions in Water: A Case of Facile Differentiation of Cocaine Adulterants, Levamisole and Dexamisole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic pillar[6]arenes encompass a new class of cavitands with planar chirality, unique binding pockets, and great water solubility. These easily accessible hosts permit differentiating racemic dexamisole from levamisole as known cocaine adulterants. Dendritic pillar[6]arenes can now be used for stereoselective recognition, chemosensing, and sequestration of a broad range of chiral drugs. 








Abstract
We describe the preparation, conformational dynamics, and stereoselective recognition characteristics of water&#8208;soluble pillar[6]arenes pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722;. These two novel and diastereomeric cavitands comprise a 2,5&#8208;bis(ethoxy)pillar[6]arene core with one of six phenylene ring conjugated to two hexaanionic dendrons. Each dendron includes an (S)&#8722;glutamic acid amidated with two tris&#8208;carboxylic Behera's amines. Cavitands pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722; were obtained in six synthetic steps and resolved by column chromatography. The results of 1H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements are in line with pS/pR&#8211;212&#8722; having unidirectional orientation of alkoxy substituents (i.e., planar chirality) and no observable interconversion for, at least, 2 weeks. Computational studies supported with 1H DOSY NMR measurements revealed that sufficiently bulky dendrons require high activation energy to pass through the pillararene's cylindrical cavity therefore inhibiting rotation of the phenylene holding them. With the unique and chiral binding pocket, pS&#8211;212&#8722; (pR&#8211;212&#8722;) formed inclusion complexes with cocaine adulterants levamisole and dexamisole (Kd&#160;&gt;&#160;mM), with their racemic mixture showing separate 1H NMR spectroscopic resonances. In this way, dendritic pillar[6]arenes can be used as chiral shift reagents for determining enantiopurity of pharmaceuticals but also for examining a variety of chiral recognition processes, sensing of chiral molecules, and stereoselective sequestrations in aqueous media.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Production with a Nearly 2% Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency via a Dedicated Construction of Redox Centers in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMFS&#8208;Cu showed excellent activity for H2O2 photosynthesis with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. The single&#8208;atom Cu sites in NMFS&#8208;Cu promote the formation of Cu&#8208;&#956;&#8208;peroxide (Cu&#8208;O2&#8722;) and desorption of *H2O2, leading to an efficient 2e&#8722; ORR pathway. The in situ generated O2 via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR resulting in a boosted photocatalytic generation of H2O2.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green oxidant widely used in a variety of industries. Photocatalytic generation of H2O2 from water and oxygen by sunlight is an appealing strategy compared to the high energy consumption of the industrial anthraquinone process. However, the low activity and selectivity of the two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the photocatalytic process greatly restricts the H2O2 production efficiency. Here, we demonstrated that the redox centers in MOFs (NMFS&#8208;M, single&#8208;atom M linked to an iron&#8208;oxo cluster in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe) by a molecular linker cysteine, M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for the production of H2O2 from water and oxygen. The optimal NMFS&#8208;Cu stably generates H2O2 under simulated sunlight irradiation with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency under AM1.5 spectrum and an apparent quantum yield of 19.6% at 420&#160;nm. Combined with density functional theory calculations, isotopic experiments, and advanced spectroscopic characterizations, the high photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the notably promoted sequential two&#8208;step ORR to H2O2 by forming &#956;&#8208;peroxide and desorption of *H2O2 at the single&#8208;atom Cu sites. The in situ generated O2 via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR, leading to a boosted photocatalytic generation of H2O2.

         <title>Selectively Modulating the Donor and Acceptor Aggregation Behaviors Through Solid Additive Isomerization Engineering for Organic Solar Cells Exceeding 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation in organic solar cells. Systematic analysis demonstrates that the isomerization of solid additives can selectively modulate the aggregation behavior of donor and acceptor materials. Consequently, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far.








Abstract
Regulating the film morphology is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Given the distinct features of donor and acceptor materials, designing solid additives to selectively control the aggregation behaviors of them represents a key strategy for further development of OSCs. Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation. Systematic analysis reveals that the addition of 2,2&#8208;TT significantly enhances the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of L8&#8208;BO, yet exerts a relatively limited effect on PM6 aggregation. Conversely, the incorporation of 3,3&#8208;TT not only facilitates the formation of compact and highly ordered molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO but also substantially promote the denser &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of PM6. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs with 3,3&#8208;TT treatment achieve a higher efficiency of 19.34%, benefitting from the balanced charge mobility and longer carrier lifetime. More impressively, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far. This work highlights the critical role of the solid additive isomerization strategy in selectively regulating the aggregation characteristics of donor and acceptor materials, thereby facilitating the further advancement of OSCs field.

         <title>Regulation of Relay Catalytic Mechanism for Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiOOH&#8208;Mo2C@C heterojunction interface is engineered to utilize differential adsorption properties of its phases for methanol and OH&#8722;, thereby regulating the interfacial distribution of reactive species. The spatial regulation facilitates migration kinetics of *CHO intermediates from OH&#8722;&#8208;deficient NiOOH to OH&#8722;&#8208;rich Mo2C surface, enabling relay catalysis to overcome kinetic barriers and enhance methanol oxidation efficiency.








Abstract
The methanol oxidation reaction serves as a representative model for multistep catalytic processes involving diverse intermediates. Catalyst design strategies that spatially arrange discrete active sites, analogous to relay runners, facilitate the sequential activation of reaction steps, thereby enhancing overall catalytic efficiency compared to single&#8208;site catalysts. This approach effectively decouples complex reaction networks into a sequence of coordinated elementary steps, thereby enhancing the production efficiency of the target products. Here, we propose a relay catalysis paradigm through electrochemical in situ construction of NiOOH&#8208;Mo2C@C heterojunction featuring with dual Lewis acid sites. By precisely controlling interfacial methanol/OH&#8722; concentration gradients, nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for formate production is achieved during methanol electrooxidation. Multiscale characterizations combined with density functional theory computations reveal that the engineered interface regulates *CHO intermediate migration from NiOOH to Mo2C domains, thereby effectively shifting the rate&#8208;determining step from *CHO&#8208;OH&#8722; coupling to O&#9472;H bond cleavage. This spatial decoupling strategy reduces the thermodynamic barrier by 1.18&#160;eV. This study elucidates a design strategy that tailors the spatial distribution of electrochemical interface species to guide catalytic pathway optimization. Furthermore, it highlights the essential role of heterojunction&#8208;mediated relay catalysis in enhancing electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of organic small molecules.

         <title>Intramolecular Phosphinyl&#8208;Zincation of Alkynes: A Powerful Entry to Benzophosphole Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ortho&#8208;alkynylated secondary arylphosphine oxides undergo phosphinyl&#8208;zincation upon reaction with Et2Zn under gentle heating. The ensuing C3&#8208;zincated benzophosphole oxides have been characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy. They are readily derivatized via Cu or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;C cross&#8208;couplings. This one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step process gives straightforward and efficient access to a wide range of benzophosphole oxides with diverse substitution patterns.








Abstract
Upon reacting ortho&#8208;alkynylated secondary arylphosphine oxides with Et2Zn, we discovered that P(O)&#9472;H activation is followed upon gentle heating by phosphinyl&#8208;zincation. This unprecedented transformation stands as a phosphorus version of the silyl and germyl&#8208;zincation of alkynes recently shown to give modular access to elaborated tri and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes. The cyclic vinyl&#8208;zinc derivative resulting from intramolecular phosphinyl&#8208;zincation was characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy. It subsequently undergoes Cu or Pd&#8208;catalyzed derivatizations with a broad range of electrophiles. The synthetic utility of this one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step process has been leveraged to prepare a wide range of benzophosphole oxides (BPO) with diverse substitution patterns. Furthermore, &#960;&#8208;extended BPOs have been synthesized by C&#9472;C coupling or cyclization of C3&#8208;alkynyl / alkenyl substituted compounds and their optical properties have been analyzed.

         <title>Full P4 to P3&#8722; Reduction with a Redox&#8208;Active Metal Crown Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the crown: Reduction of P4 generally results in larger polyphosphide Zintl anions: Pmn&#713;. However, using a hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble Mg0 complex, P4 can be fully reduced to mononuclear P3&#713;. The metal crown opens to a two&#8208;armed pincer&#8208;like ligand that efficiently stabilizes the phosphido anion. Latter P3&#713; anion reacts as a base, a three&#8208;fold nucleophile or a reducing agent. 








Abstract
Traditional bulk syntheses of phosphorus compounds start with P4 to PCl3 oxidation but more sustainable methods cleave P&#9472;P bonds reductively. This generally results in larger polyphosphide Zintl anions: Pmn&#713;. We report a relatively selective full reduction of P4 at room temperature to give a unique hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble s&#8208;block metal complex of the P3&#713; anion. Key to this chemistry is a recently reported redox&#8208;active metal crown complex: (BDI*)MgNa3N&#8243;2 (VI); N&#8243;&#160;=&#160;N(SiMe3)2 and BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(tBu)C&#9552;N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;CHEt2&#8208;phenyl. The reduction of P4 according to 2 VI&#160;+&#160;0.25 P4&#160;&#8594;&#160;(BDI*)MgNa5N&#8243;3P (1)&#160;+&#160;0.5 [(BDI*)Mg]2&#160;+&#160;0.33 (NaN&#8243;)3 is calculated to be exothermic (&#916;H&#160;=&#160;&#8722;40.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). The crystal structure of 1 shows a strongly bound (BDI*)MgP2&#713; anion with two chelating [Na&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;Na+] and [Na&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;Na&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;Na+] arms of unequal length. Although these arms are highly fluxional and rapidly exchange ions, they effectively stabilize the P3&#713; anion. DFT calculations confirm the highly ionic nature of the complex and describe P3&#713; as full valence&#8208;shell anion with four lone&#8208;pairs of electrons. Reactivity studies show that the P3&#713; anion can react as a triple Br&#248;nsted base, a three&#8208;fold nucleophile or as a reducing agent.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breaking the crown&lt;/b&gt;: Reduction of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; generally results in larger polyphosphide Zintl anions: P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&#713;. However, using a hydrocarbon-soluble Mg&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex, P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be fully reduced to mononuclear P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#713;. The metal crown opens to a two-armed pincer-like ligand that efficiently stabilizes the phosphido anion. Latter P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#713; anion reacts as a base, a three-fold nucleophile or a reducing agent. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional bulk syntheses of phosphorus compounds start with P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation but more sustainable methods cleave P&#9472;P bonds reductively. This generally results in larger polyphosphide Zintl anions: P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&#713;. We report a relatively selective full reduction of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature to give a unique hydrocarbon-soluble &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-block metal complex of the P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#713; anion. Key to this chemistry is a recently reported redox-active metal crown complex: (BDI*)MgNa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8243;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;VI&lt;/b&gt;); N&#8243;&#160;=&#160;N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)C&#9552;N-DIPeP]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6-CHEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-phenyl. The reduction of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; according to 2 &lt;b&gt;VI&lt;/b&gt;&#160;+&#160;0.25 P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8594;&#160;(BDI*)MgNa&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8243;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;)&#160;+&#160;0.5 [(BDI*)Mg]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+&#160;0.33 (NaN&#8243;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated to be exothermic (&#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#8722;40.5&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Encapsulation Enhances the Quantum Coherence of a Solid&#8208;State Molecular Spin Qubit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A purely synthetic supramolecular chemistry approach enables the protection of the spin&#8208;based qubit [Cr(ox)3]3&#8722; from external sources of decoherence in the solid state, leading to the enhancement of the phase memory and the spin lattice relaxation time, thus validating this chemical engineering strategy for qubit implementation.








Abstract
Spins within molecules benefit from the atomistic control of synthetic chemistry for the realization of qubits. One advantage is that the quantum superpositions of the spin states encoding the qubit can be coherently manipulated using electromagnetic radiation. The main challenge is the fragility of these superpositions when qubits are to partake of solid&#8208;state devices. We address this issue with a supramolecular approach for protecting molecular spin qubits against decoherence. The molecular qubit [Cr(ox)3]3&#8722; has been encapsulated inside the diamagnetic triple&#8208;stranded helicate [Zn2L3]4+ (L is a bis&#8208;pyrazolylpyridine ligand). The quantum coherence of the protected qubit is then analyzed with pulsed EPR spectroscopy and compared with the unprotected qubit, both in solution and in the solid state. Crucially, the spin&#8211;spin relaxation in the solid state has been examined within diamagnetic crystal lattices of the isostructural ([Al(ox)3]@[Zn2L3])+ or [Al(ox)3]3&#8208; assemblies, respectively, doped with the Cr3+ qubit in two different (&lt;10%) concentrations. The study unveils a surprising increase of the phase memory time of the qubit upon encapsulation only in the solid. Spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times also exhibit a significant enhancement, as established from inversion recovery pulse sequences and from slow relaxation of the magnetization of the protected qubit, not featured by the free qubit.

         <title>Halogenation&#8208;Engineered Acceptor Enables 20.14% Efficiency in Hydrocarbon&#8208;Solvent Processed OSCs: From Binary Trade&#8208;Offs to Ternary Synergy in Exciton and Energy Loss Management</title>

Halogenation engineering of benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors enables nonhalogenated solvent processed organic solar cells with an efficiency 20.14%, revealing how halogenation modulates intermolecular interactions, energy loss, and morphology.








Abstract
Halogenation emerges as a key strategy to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) by tuning molecular packing, energy levels, and charge dynamics. Here, we report three new benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;core small&#8208;molecule acceptors, namely NA5, NA6, and NA7, and systematically evaluate their photovoltaic properties in o&#8208;xylene&#8208;processed binary and ternary OSCs. Halogenation significantly strengthens intermolecular interactions, improves charge carrier mobility, and facilitates exciton dissociation, leading to a remarkable increase in binary device efficiencies from &#8764;2% (NA5) to over 17% (NA6, NA7). However, halogenation also increases charge&#8208;transfer state character, which can induce higher nonradiative recombination and energy loss. Despite this drawback, the enhanced driving force for charge separation and improved morphological order enabled by halogenation outweigh the negative effects on energy loss. Notably, incorporation of NA7 into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 ternary system optimizes blend morphology, suppresses nonradiative recombination, and thus achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 20.14% (certified 19.93%)&#8212;the highest reported for OSCs processed with hydrocarbon solvents. These findings highlight the dual role of halogenation in modulating both beneficial and detrimental aspects of device energetics, providing new insights into molecular design strategies for high&#8208;performance, environmental&#8208;friendly OSCs.

         <title>Rocking (and Shuttling) in a Nanosized Metallobox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudo&#8208;rotaxane system featuring an naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based guest encapsulated in a nanosized metallorectangle shows redox&#8208;modulated stability and reversible chloride&#8208;triggered guest release. Combined NMR and computational studies reveal distinct shuttling and rocking motions, highlighting dynamic behavior essential for designing responsive supramolecular devices. 








Abstract
Gaining insight into the dynamic behavior of supramolecular systems is essential for understanding selective guest encapsulation and for the rational design of nanodevices capable of precise, controllable motion at the molecular scale. In this work, we report the construction of a pseudo&#8208;rotaxane system through the encapsulation of a naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivative bearing long aliphatic chains within the cavity of a nanosized metallorectangle. Electrochemical studies reveal that encapsulation significantly alters the redox properties of the guest. In addition, upon reduction, the NDI&#8208;based radical is stably confined within the host cavity, forming a persistent host&#8211;guest complex. This encapsulated radical species can be released upon the addition of chloride ions, demonstrating a clear example of reversible, stimuli&#8208;responsive guest uptake and release. To elucidate the internal dynamics of the system, we employed variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with computational modeling. These studies revealed two distinct modes of motion: a) a shuttling motion, in which the guest slides along the axis of the host cavity between central and peripheral positions; and b) a rocking motion, involving partial rotation of the guest enabled by the flexible movement of its aliphatic chains within the host interior.

         <title>Cobalt Polypyridyl&#8208;Enabled Highly Regioselective &#945;&#8208;Heteroarylation of N,O&#8208;Containing Aliphatics Through Photoelectrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a simple yet underexplored strategy exploiting single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) mechanisms to leverage subtle electron density differences between adjacent C&#9472;H bonds. This approach has been successfully implemented using a cobalt&#8208;based photocatalyst in a photoelectrocatalytic system, demonstrating compelling potential for enhanced site selectivity. 








Abstract
The regioselective functionalization of C&#9472;H bonds at positions with nearly identical chemical environments remains a pivotal challenge in synthetic chemistry. While conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) strategies dominate current methodologies, their limitations in selectivity drive the pursuit of alternative mechanisms. Here, we report a photoelectrochemically cooperative catalytic system mediated by a polypyridyl cobalt catalyst, enabling highly regioselective &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation of ethers, alcohols, and amides. Unlike previous cobalt&#8208;based systems in which bond formation occurs independently of the cobalt metal center, the catalyst functions as a photocatalyst to directly oxidize substrates via a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process. This strategy eschews traditional HAT pathways, achieving exclusive &#945;&#8208;site selectivity for most substrates while exhibiting broad adaptability to diverse heteroarenes. Subsequent derivatization studies, including oxidation, hydrolysis, reduction, and chloromethylation, validate the synthetic utility for accessing pharmaceutical intermediates.

         <title>Discrete Actuation of Water&#8208;Responsive Crystalline Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design metal&#8211;peptide frameworks that exhibit either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;responsive actuation by tuning water&#8208;binding affinities and structural dynamics. In the continuous actuation mode, water molecules evaporate sequentially due to varying interaction strengths and structural roles. Conversely, when water molecules display comparable interactions and roles, they release simultaneously during dehydration, producing discrete threshold actuation.








Abstract
Engineering guest&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled and precise sorption behavior and structural deformation in response to external stimuli is imperative for various applications. However, existing systems often exhibit complex, unpredictable dynamics, posing challenges for efficient control and utilization. Here, we design crystalline metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with tunable water&#8208;responsive (WR) dynamics by assembling glycine&#8208;threonine (Gly&#8208;Thr, GT) or glycine&#8208;serine (Gly&#8208;Ser, GS) peptides with zinc (Zn) ions, achieving either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;sorption&#8208;dependent phase transitions. As ambient relative humidity (RH) changes, the Zn&#8208;GT crystal continuously adsorbs or desorbs water, resulting in gradual structural adaptations, similar to those observed in other supramolecular systems. In contrast, the Zn&#8208;GS crystal undergoes stepwise water sorption and structural transitions at specific RH thresholds. These contrasting WR modes arise from differences in water binding and structural dynamics; in Zn&#8208;GT, each coordinating water molecule contributes varying degrees of framework integrity and evaporates sequentially, whereas in Zn&#8208;GS, water molecules with comparable interactions within a flexible framework are released simultaneously during dehydration. Our study demonstrates the mechanism by which host&#8211;guest interactions can be harnessed to control dynamic sorption and actuation behavior of supramolecular materials at the molecular level, offering mechanistic insights that may guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation programmable, stimulus&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>Ligand Engineering&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Activity of Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;Siloxane Clusters for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz nanoclusters are surgically sculpted into the octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC) configuration through ligand engineering, where each ligand in OZSBPC is adorned with an appended benzene ring. Benefitting from the electronic and molecular modulation effect of benzene rings, the reinforced electrical conductivity, sulfur loading capacity, and adsorption characteristics are endowed to the OZSBPC, ultimately achieving the optimization of lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic performance.








Abstract
Polynuclear metal clusters (PMC) with atomically defined architectures exhibit unique electrochemical catalytic behaviors in lithium&#8722;sulfur battery (LSB). Nevertheless, the precise fabrication of PMC with tailored configurations, and a comprehensive understanding of their structure&#8208;dependent property evolution, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, ligand engineering is employed to upgrade octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz clusters by grafting one more benzene ring onto azopyrazole ligand to form octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC). An integrated investigation combining kinetic analyses, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveals that the introduction of biphenyl moieties enlarges the intrinsic cavity to host more sulfur species, while the conjugation&#8208;enhanced ligand framework facilitates more efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the enhanced nucleophilicity at nitrogen sites and the upshifted d&#8208;band center synergistically strengthen the affinity toward polysulfides via &#960;&#8722;&#960; conjugation interactions. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of OZSBPC undergoes a substantial enhancement, thereby enabling the assembled Ah&#8208;class Li&#8722;S pouch cell delivers a peak energy density of 504&#160;Wh&#160;kgtotal&#8722;1, and sustains stable cycling at 429&#160;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1 for 40 cycles. Moreover, stable operation over 150 cycles is achieved under &#8722;33&#160;&#176;C. Our study makes a breakthrough in precisely constructing PMC and in optimizing the performance via progressive structure upgrading, which made a landmark impact on lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic chemistry.

Abstract
All inorganic lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3) has become a hot topic in chiral optics for its high quantum yield and tunable luminescence. The environmental degradation tendency and lack of magneto&#8208;optical coupling mechanism of lead&#8208;based perovskite severely restrict its chirality integrated application. Rare&#8208;earth ions (such as Gd3+, Eu3+), with their unique 4f electronic configuration, not only passivate the lattice defects to improve stability but also expand the spectral response range through electronic localization effects. In this study, we proposed a strategy to introduce magneto&#8208;optical active rare&#8208;earth ions (Gd3+, Eu3+) into the CsPbX3 lattice to form nanosheets (NSs), and oriented assembled into large scale chiral films with tailorable chiroptical activity ranging from 300 to 700&#160;nm and achieved tailoring a multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) system with angle dependent polarization switching characteristics. Chiral Gd3+:CsPbBr3 NSs films and chiral Eu3+:CsPb(Br/Cl)3 NSs films exhibited significantly increased luminescence asymmetry factor of |glum| up to 10&#8722;2 and also displayed enhanced magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) responses. We further developed an optical encryption system based on multidimensional regulation of components/polarization/wavelength, enabling dynamic programmable information storage and providing a new material platform for spin photon devices, quantum communication, and high&#8208;end anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Dihydroxanthene&#8208;Derived Dioxetane Chemiluminophores for Activatable in Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived dioxetane chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) is developed through rational design, structural optimization, and acceptor engineering. DhX&#8208;CLs feature a novel modular core structure, tunable chemiluminescence wavelengths, high quantum yields, long near&#8208;infrared emission, biocompatibility, activatable capability, and in vivo imaging applicability.








Abstract
Chemiluminophores with optimal chemiluminescence properties and versatile structures adaptable into activatable chemiluminescent probes are of particular interest for biosensing and imaging owing to their high sensitivity and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.

Herein, we report dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) that integrate an adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane moiety with a rationally designed dihydroxanthene&#8208;like core skeleton featuring an extended and restricted &#960;&#8208;electron system.

&lt;p&gt;A new family of dihydroxanthene-derived dioxetane chemiluminophores (DhX-CLs) is developed through rational design, structural optimization, and acceptor engineering. DhX-CLs feature a novel modular core structure, tunable chemiluminescence wavelengths, high quantum yields, long near-infrared emission, biocompatibility, activatable capability, and in vivo imaging applicability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemiluminophores with optimal chemiluminescence properties and versatile structures adaptable into activatable chemiluminescent probes are of particular interest for biosensing and imaging owing to their high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. However, such chemiluminophores are still limited. Herein, we report dihydroxanthene-derived chemiluminophores (DhX-CLs) that integrate an adamantyl-dioxetane moiety with a rationally designed dihydroxanthene-like core skeleton featuring an extended and restricted &#960;-electron system. Structural optimization of the dihydroxanthene-aldehyde-based prototype chemiluminophore generated a bright yellow chemiluminophore DhX-CL4 with a quantum yield of 35.4% under aqueous conditions, higher than those of existing dioxetanes in the green-to-near-infrared (NIR) range beyond 500&#160;nm. Further &#960;-electron extension and acceptor engineering resulted in NIR chemiluminophores with high brightness and biocompatibility. Notably, DhX-CL7 exhibits long-lasting chemiluminescence with a maximum NIR emission at 808&#160;nm and a quantum yield 3.17%, higher than those of most reported NIR chemiluminophores.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity Profiling of Multiple Nearby Mutations via Cooperative Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative recognition that integrates both hybridization and ligation&#8208;based recognition mechanisms is introduced to enable AND&#8208;gate&#8208;based detection of multiple nearby mutations with high specificity and robustness. This strategy allows accurate discrimination of microRNA from its family members and isoforms, as well as the high&#8208;fidelity identification of drug&#8208;resistant single nucleotide variants in lung cancer patients.








Abstract
Detection methods with single&#8208;nucleotide specificity are essential tools for nucleic acid analysis in diverse clinical and biological settings. However, both hybridization&#8208;based and enzyme&#8208;based methods are only effective for discriminating single&#8208;nucleotide mutations at certain positions, making it difficult to detect nucleic acid targets having multiple nearby mutations. Herein, we describe the design of cooperative recognition probes (CRPs) that integrate both hybridization and ligation&#8208;based recognition mechanisms and thus are highly effective for discriminating mutations throughout all positions. The cooperative nature of CRPs further enables AND&#8208;gate&#8208;based detection of multiple nearby mutations with high fidelity and specificity. Moreover, CRPs generate circular or linear ligation products that can be readily amplified by rolling circle amplification or polymerase chain reaction, making our strategy readily adaptable to diverse biological and clinical settings. Leveraging CRPs, we demonstrate the detection of nucleic acid targets that are difficult to be discriminated using conventional strategies, such as the highly specific discrimination of microRNA from its family members and isoforms, and the high&#8208;fidelity identification of drug&#8208;resistant single&#8208;nucleotide variants in the presence of nearby synchronous mutations in lung cancer samples.

         <title>The Origin of the Feedstock Molecules for Life on the Hadean Earth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of life in the Hadean eon required the formation of amino acids and nucleosides among the key molecules of life. In an often postulated strongly reducing atmosphere, HCN and its derivatives are robustly formed as plausible starting molecules. But HCN does not form in a Hadean, weakly reducing atmosphere. Instead, aldehydes and NO are produced, which react to produce oxime, amidoxime, and nitrile&#8208;based feedstock molecules as precursors.








Abstract
The origin of life in the Hadean eon required the formation of amino acids and nucleosides among the key molecules of life. It is assumed that highly unsaturated carbon and nitrogen containing feedstock molecules, which form in a strongly reducing H2&#8208;atmosphere were the reactive starting materials. The Hadean Earth was, however, surrounded by a CO2&#8208;dominated atmosphere and the question of how under such inert conditions the biomolecules could have formed is unsolved. Here, we report that HNO and formaldehyde, which form robustly in a weakly reducing atmosphere by lightning and UV&#8208;irradiation, react with SO2 to produce oxime, amidoxime, and nitrile&#8208;containing molecules, which react to give precursors to amino acids and all four canonical nucleosides. The small number of feedstock molecules required suggests that the molecules of life can robustly form on all types of rock planets with volcanic activity and a CO2&#8208;dominated atmosphere.

         <title>Stereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Topologically Chiral [6]Catenane with 18 Crossings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective construction of a record&#8208;complex 24&#8208;metal [6]catenane (1816$18_1^6$ link) with 18 crossings is achieved via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enables exclusive formation of topological enantiomers, each featuring four topologically chiral stereogenic units. Synergistic &#960;&#8208;stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects direct the formation of this six&#8208;ring entangled architecture. 








Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit unique properties and functions arising from their structural entanglement, features of which are absent in their individual components. However, synthesizing topologically complex architectures, particularly those with topological chirality, remains a significant challenge due to the lack of general methods for controlled entanglement. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of a 24&#8208;metal&#8208;center topologically chiral [6]catenane featuring 18 crossings (1816$18_1^6$ link), representing one of the most intricate MIMs constructed to date. This complex architecture was achieved in high yield (71%) via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of 12 chiral semirigid bidentate ligands and 12 conjugated binuclear half&#8208;sandwich organometallic clips. Critically, chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enabled exclusive formation of topological enantiomer pairs (Rh&#8208;1S/Rh&#8208;1R), each containing four topologically chiral stereogenic units&#8212;three cyclic [3]catenane components and one closed three&#8208;link chain component. The self&#8208;assembly is synergistically directed by integrated noncovalent interactions (sevenfold &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects), as unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This design strategy, incorporating tailored noncovalent interaction sites in building blocks, provides a viable approach for synthesizing other structurally complex topologically chiral MIMs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Mediated Silacyclization by Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Selective C&#9472;F or C&#9472;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;dependent, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes is developed to enable the efficient construction of six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. Selective C&#8211;F functionalization is achieved under 456&#160;nm LED irradiation, while irradiation at 335&#160;nm promotes acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization via C&#8211;H functionalization.








Abstract
Silacycles have gained significant attention within the synthetic community due to their pivotal roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Despite recent advancements, the defluorosilylation of aryl fluorides with hydrosilanes and the selective silylation of arenes without external oxidants remains challenging. Herein, we present a wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;mediated cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes to efficiently construct six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. By employing a synergistic system of an organophotocatalyst and a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, our approach exploits specific light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) wavelengths (456 and 335&#160;nm) to achieve selective C&#8211;F and C&#8211;H functionalization. This wavelength modulation enables the first successful defluorosilacyclization of ortho&#8208;fluoroallylbenzenes and facilitates an acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization, demonstrating precise site&#8208;selective functionalization. Mechanistic investigations reveal a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;facilitated intermolecular hydrosilylation followed by a wavelength&#8208;dependent, chemoselective intramolecular silacyclization cascade. Additionally, an unprecedented light&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution process involving silane and thiol is uncovered within the cascade C&#8211;H silacyclization. This photo&#8208;mediated strategy offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the synthesis of valuable silacycle compounds, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and precise wavelength&#8208;dependent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Healing Strategy Enabling Efficient and Stable ETL&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing an indium sulfate functional layer at the buried interface, In3+ forms a gradient doping, eliminating harmful defects through dynamic redox cycles (Pb0&#8594;Pb2+, I0&#8594;I&#8722;) to achieve synergistic bulk and interfacial healing, and leading to a high efficiency of 22.97% and excellent device stability for the ETL&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells without electron transport layers (ETL&#8208;free PSCs) have garnered increasing attention in recent years due to their simplified fabrication process and low production costs. However, non&#8208;radiative recombination of charge carriers and band energy mismatch at the interface significantly limit device performance. Here, we propose an ion&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing strategy introducing an indium sulfate (ln2(SO4)3) functional layer at the buried interface of the perovskite. The ln3+ exhibits gradient doping at the buried interface, acting as a redox buffer to oxidize Pb0 to Pb2+, while the generated ln+ reduces I0 to I&#8722;, forming a self&#8208;healing redox dynamic cycle. The incorporation of indium sulfate effectively improves the contact properties and band energy alignment at the ITO/perovskite interface, ultimately achieving a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 22.97%. The device retains 91.6% of its initial efficiency after 1200&#160;h of continuous illumination, providing new insights for the development and application of perovskite solar cells without electron transport layers.

         <title>A Broadly Applicable Strategy to Aminate Azines Enabled by Electronically Tuned Phosphine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a pyridine C4&#8208;amination reaction via phosphonium salt intermediates, where an electronically tuned phosphine is key to successful C&#9472;N bond formation. The process accommodates aliphatic amines, (heteroaryl)anilines, hydrazines, and nitrogen heteroaromatics, as well as a variety of pyridine building blocks and late&#8208;stage C&#9472;N couplings.








Abstract
We describe a strategy for aminating pyridines and other azines via phosphonium salt intermediates. Precisely tuning the electronic properties of the phosphonium ion was key for C&#9472;N bond formation via an SNAr&#8208;halogenation, SNAr&#8208;amination sequence. The process couples a wide range of amine classes with pyridines and is viable for applications such as late&#8208;stage amination of complex pharmaceuticals and fragment&#8211;fragment coupling reactions. The capacity to rapidly modify the structure of the phosphine reagent was decisive and is a valuable feature in pseudohalide design.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Alkaline Double Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double electrolyte strategy combining an acidic catholyte (7&#160;M H3PO4) and an alkaline anolyte (6&#160;M KOH), separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM), enables a 1.83&#160;V aqueous proton battery. Using CoCuHCF and benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) as electrodes, the system achieves high energy&#8212;power output and excellent cycling stability, offering a new path for high&#8208;voltage aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries offer a promising energy storage solution due to their inherent safety, rapid ion mobility, and low cost. However, their performance is largely constrained by water's limited electrochemical stability, restricting operating voltage and energy density. This study addresses this challenge by introducing an innovative acid&#8208;alkaline double electrolyte configuration to achieve high&#8208;voltage aqueous proton batteries. Employing a high&#8208;anodic&#8208;limit acidic catholyte (7&#160;M H3PO4) and a low&#8208;cathodic&#8208;limit alkaline anolyte (6&#160;M KOH), separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM), significantly expands the full battery's electrochemical stability window (ESW) to 2.91&#160;V. Cobalt&#8208;doped Prussian blue (CoCuHCF) was selected as the cathode due to its superior proton kinetics and cycling durability, while benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) was identified as an optimal anode via combined theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Consequently, the battery delivered exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a high energy density of 329.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, a remarkable power density of 14788.3&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling stability with 98.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. The proposed acid&#8208;alkaline double electrolyte strategy provides efficient and valuable guidance for advancing aqueous energy storage technologies.

         <title>Tuning Surface Concentrations of Building Units to Enable the Cathodic Deposition of Metastable ZIF&#8208;L Films for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic deposition enables the formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films, yet precise control of surface building&#8208;unit concentrations remain challenging. By finely tuning these concentrations, metastable ZIF&#8208;L membranes are obtained with high gas separation performance. This approach establishes a general strategy for regulating building units under negative bias, applicable to other surface&#8208;sensitive MOFs.








Abstract
Cathodic deposition is an emerging technique for the preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films. However, monitoring and controlling the concentrations of MOF building units (i.e., metal nodes and ligands) on the electrode surface remains challenging and has yet to be reported. This limitation greatly hinders the application of this technique to the synthesis of MOFs sensitive to building unit concentrations, such as the well&#8208;known metastable ZIF&#8208;L. Here, using the cathodic deposition of ZIF&#8208;L films as an example, we demonstrate how the surface metal node and ligand concentrations influence ZIF&#8208;L film generation by utilizing in situ pH measurements and theoretical calculations. Also, we propose a strategy to regulate the concentrations of these building units, enabling the straightforward and rapid cathodic deposition of thin ZIF&#8208;L films. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) post&#8208;modification, the electrochemically deposited ZIF&#8208;L films on commercial anodized alumina oxide (AAO) substrate exhibit good gas separation performance, achieving a H2/N2 selectivity of 19.4 and a H2 permeance exceeding 360 GPU (1 GPU&#160;=&#160;3.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#8304; mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1 Pa&#8722;1).

         <title>Chiral Molecules Induce Enantiomorphic Lattice Helicity in Chiral 0D Tin Bromide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral (R&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 and (S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 metal halides crystallize in enantiomorphic helical space groups P61 and P65, respectively. The helical orientation of chiral molecules in the lattice arises due to strong N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and is visualized via sixfold symmetry. The crystals show mirror&#8208;image CD spectra (g&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and circularly polarized SHG with a dissymmetry factor (gCP&#8211;SHG) up to 0.44.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have emerged as a promising class of materials for spin&#8208;controlled optical and optoelectronic effects and related applications. Chiral hybrid metal halides generally crystallize in non&#8208;helical space groups. Herein, we report the discovery of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral (R/S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium cation) single crystals with enantiomorphic lattice helicity. The S&#8208;enantiomer of the chiral molecule induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P61 space group (right&#8208;handed, P&#8208;helix), while the R&#8208;enantiomer induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P65 space group (left&#8208;handed, M&#8208;helix). The chiral molecules induce the helical twist of inorganic units in the lattice through N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong electronic coupling between chiral molecules and SnBr62&#8722; subunits is responsible for the generation of chirality.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have emerged as a promising class of materials for spin-controlled optical and optoelectronic effects and related applications. Chiral hybrid metal halides generally crystallize in non-helical space groups. Herein, we report the discovery of zero-dimensional (0D) chiral (R/S-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (MBA: methylbenzylammonium cation) single crystals with enantiomorphic lattice helicity. The S-enantiomer of the chiral molecule induces right-handed helicity with the P6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space group (right-handed, P-helix), while the R-enantiomer induces right-handed helicity with the P6&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; space group (left-handed, M-helix). The chiral molecules induce the helical twist of inorganic units in the lattice through N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong electronic coupling between chiral molecules and SnBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; subunits is responsible for the generation of chirality. The chiral crystals exhibit circular dicroism (CD) spectra with a high dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CD&lt;/sub&gt;) of 3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Convergent Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis Synthesis of Ethylene Oxide from CO2 and Water at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem electrochemical&#8211;chemical system that couples CO2 reduction (CO2R) toward C2H4 and two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) toward H2O2 in a single electrolyzer with ambient epoxidation was reported to produce ethylene oxide (EO) from CO2 and H2O.








Abstract
Ethylene oxide (EO) is an important commodity chemical, and its production currently relies on fossil fuel&#8208;based energy&#8208;intensive thermocatalysis associated with substantial CO2 emissions or the usage of toxic/corrosive precursors (e.g., Cl2). Herein, we report a convergent electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem route for efficient synthesis of EO from CO2 and water under ambient conditions over nonprecious catalysts. Such a protype consists of cathodic CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 and simultaneous anodic two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) to H2O2 in a single electrolyzer, followed by reaction of the two products over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst toward EO with high production rate of 422.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of&#160;&gt;98%. W&#8208;doped CuOx and Cu&#8208;doped SnO2 were used as cathode and anode electrodes with respective Faradaic efficiencies of 63.5% and 75.6% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Systematic characterizations, including 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), isotope&#8208;labeling mass spectrometry (MS), and operando infrared spectroscopy, along with theoretical calculations, reveal that Cu doping breaks the electronic structure symmetry of Sn to induce electron redistribution for optimal adsorption and coupling of key intermediates like *OH in 2e&#8208;WOR. This study offers a sustainable manner for efficient EO synthesis from raw materials with renewable electricity input.

         <title>A Water Soluble and Solid&#8208;State Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) System as Renewable Solar Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;A new series of highly water soluble norbornadienes has been synthesized and characterized as molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems in gram scale. Particularly, concentrated solutions (1&#160;M) and solid&#8208;state heat release showed a thermal heat release of 7.5&#160;and 39.6&#160;K, respectively, with full reversibility in both cases. These systems represent a new avenue for transferring the MOST technology to real and sustainable applications.&#8221;








Abstract
Solar energy storage is key to overcome the intermittent character of sunlight. We present a sustainable solution based on norbornadiene&#8211;quadricyclane pairs for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage working in highly concentrated neutral water solutions and solid state. Photochemical preparation of high&#8208;energy, metastable isomers in previously unattainable 1.64&#160;M solutions was achieved. The best compound can be stored for 1.9 years and is stable in solid state, allowing for the preparation of up to 3&#160;M water solutions. Catalyzed back&#8208;conversion ensures efficient heat release and starting material recovery with remarkable fatigue resistance in water solution and solid state, exhibiting macroscopic heat release in both states, providing a &#916;T of 39.6&#160;K and fully recyclable use. These results highlight a promising avenue for the practical application of MOST technology.

         <title>Programmable Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Through Stereocontrol of Chiral Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Co&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral inducers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) with varying binaphthalene dihedral angles were selected with achiral liquid crystalline polymer PyP to form chiral co&#8208;assemblies. As the dihedral angle of the binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9 could emit inverted and amplified circularly polarized electroluminescence with a |gEL| value up to 0.18 compared with (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) are essential to prospective 3D displays and advanced polarized lighting systems. The rational design of programmable circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) materials with a large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (gEL) remains a great challenge and is still in its preliminary exploration phase. In this work, two aggregation induced emission active (AIE&#8208;active) chiral inducers with different dihedral angles of binaphthalene (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) and achiral acrylate&#8208;based liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) (PyP) were chosed to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. Interestingly, as the dihedral angle of the AIE&#8208;active binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2&#8208;PyP) could emit inverted and amplified CP&#8208;EL signals compared with S&#8208;/R&#8208;1&#8208;PyP after annealing. Significantly, the (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs displayed remarkable blue CP&#8208;EL (&#955;EL&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nm, Lmax&#160;=&#160;14860&#160;cd m&#8722;2) with a record |gEL| value of up to 0.18 in chiral co&#8208;assembled CP&#8208;OLEDs to date. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CP&#8208;EL with tunable signal direction and intensity through stereocontrol of AIE&#8208;active chiral inducers in LCP co&#8208;assembled films, providing a valuable guidance for realizing programmable CP&#8208;EL.

         <title>Adaptive Hydration Chemistry Enables Fast and Durable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

RHM enables adaptive water capture and release in AZIBs, promoting uniform Zn deposition, fast Zn2&#8314; transport, and stable cycling.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, uncontrolled interfacial water remains a major hurdle, limiting both anode stability and ion transport. In this study, 2&#8208;picolinaldehyde (2PA) was chosen as a reversible hydration modulator (RHM) that enables dynamic regulation of interfacial free water. Spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that RHM captures excess water during plating to suppress hydrogen evolution and corrosion while releasing water during stripping to facilitate Zn2+ solvation and migration. In addition, RHM coordinates with Zn2+ and reorganizes its local coordination environment. Consequently, symmetric cells with the RHM&#8208;ZnSO4 electrolyte deliver prolonged cycling exceeding 4000&#160;h and excellent rate performance, with low voltage polarization even at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The corresponding full cells demonstrate durable operation for over 5000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This adaptive behavior satisfies the distinct interfacial water requirements during Zn plating and stripping, enabling interfacial stability and efficient ion transport, and provides a novel strategy for electrolyte design in AZIBs.

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>
