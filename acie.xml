      <title>Selective Electrochemical Hydrolysis of Hydrosilanes to Silanols via Anodically Generated Silyl Cations</title>
      <dc:description>The first electrochemical hydrolysis of hydrosilanes to silanols under mild and&#160;neutral reaction conditions is reported. The practical protocol employs commercially available and cheap NHPI as a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) mediator and operates at room temperature with high selectivity, leading to various valuable silanols in moderate to good yields. Notably, this electrochemical method exhibits a broad substrate scope and high functional&#8208;group compatibility, and it is applicable to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

      <dc:description>Chemically modified DNA has been widely developed to fabricate various nucleic acid nanostructures for biomedical applications. Herein, we report a facile strategy for construction of branched antisense DNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) co&#8208;assembled nanoplatform for combined gene silencing in vitro and in vivo. In our design, the branched antisense can efficiently capture siRNA with 3&#8217; overhangs through DNA&#8211;RNA hybridization.

The multifunctional nucleic acid nanosystem elicits an efficient inhibition of tumor growth based on the combined gene silencing of the tumor&#8208;associated gene polo&#8208;like kinase 1 (PLK1).

      <title>Coplanar &#960;&#8208;Extended Quinoxaline Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Material Enabling over 21% Efficiency for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting material (HTM) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs are scarce, and their molecular design principles are still unclear. Herein, we report an effective approach to improve the performance of dopant&#8208;free HTMs featuring with a quinoxaline core via rational &#960;&#8208;extension.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting material (HTM) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs are scarce, and their molecular design principles are still unclear. Herein, we report an effective approach to improve the performance of dopant&#8208;free HTMs featuring with a quinoxaline core via rational &#960;&#8208;extension. Upon incorporating rotatable or chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the pyrazine ring, the resulting molecular HTMs  TQ3  and  TQ4  show completely different molecular arrangement as well as charge transporting capabilities. Comparing with  TQ3  , the coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline based  TQ4  endows enriched intermolecular interactions and stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, thus achieving a higher hole mobility of 2.08 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  .

      <title>Optimized active layer morphologies via ternary copolymerization of polymer donors for 17.6% efficiency organic solar cells with enhanced fill factor</title>
      <dc:description>Nowadays, the commercially available polymer donor PM6 has been applied widely in organic solar cells (OSCs) and achieved the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversation efficiencies (PCEs). To fully explore its photovoltaic potential in OSCs, fine regulating the molecular structure to further optimize the related active layer morphologies is of considerable significance. Herein, we demonstrated a simple random ternary copolymerization approach to develop a terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 by carefully incorporating the third 5,5'&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz, 20 mol%) unit into the molecular backbone of PM6 (PM6&#8208;Tz00). It is found that this method can properly tailor the molecular ordering, orientation, and aggregation properties without obviously affecting absorption and energy levels of polymer donors, and then effectively optimize the active layer morphology with a small molecule acceptor Y6, as well as the electrical properties of the related devices, ultimately improving fill factor (FF) and thus boosting PCE. As a result, the PM6&#8208;Tz20&#8208;based OSCs achieved a PCE of up to 17.1% with a significantly enhanced FF of 0.77, which is much higher than that of the controlled OSCs based on PM6 (PCE=15.7% and FF=0.72). Notable, using Ag (220 nm) instead of Al (100 nm) as cathode, the champion PCE was further improved to 17.6% due to the increase of photocurrent. These are among the best results for the binary OSCs reported to date. Our work provides a simple but effective approach to optimize blend morphologies of OSCs for higher photovoltaic performance.</dc:description>

However, assembling coatings with well&#8208;defined properties on different material classes remains a challenge.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Coupling of Allenyl Radicals with Terminal Alkynes to Access Tetrasubstituted Allenes</title>
      <dc:description>In contrast to the wealth of asymmetric transformations for generating central chirality from alkyl radicals, the enantiocontrol over the allenyl radicals for forging axial chirality represents an uncharted domain. The challenge arises from the unique elongated linear configuration of the allenyl radicals that necessitates the stereo&#8208;differentiation of remote motifs away from the radical reaction site. We herein describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric radical 1,4&#8208;carboalkynylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes via the coupling of allenyl radicals with terminal alkynes, providing diverse synthetically challenging tetrasubstituted chiral allenes. A chiral N,N,P&#8208;ligand is crucial for both the reaction initiation and the enantiocontrol over the highly reactive allenyl radicals. The reaction features a broad substrate scope, covering a variety of (hetero)aryl and alkyl alkynes and 1,3&#8208;enynes as well as radical precursors with excellent functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

      <title>The Size&#8208;Accelerated Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>The factors responsible for the kinetic resolution of alcohols by chiral pyridine derivatives have been elucidated by measurements of relative rates for a set of substrates with systematically growing aromatic side chains using accurate competitive linear regression analysis. Increasing the side chain size from phenyl to pyrenyl results in a rate acceleration of more than 40 for the major enantiomer. Based on this observation a new catalyst with increased steric bulk has been designed that gives enantioselectivity values of up to  s  = 250. Extensive conformational analysis of the relevant transition states indicates that alcohol attack to the more crowded side of the acyl&#8208;catalyst intermediate is favoured due to stabilizing CH&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Experimental and theoretical results imply that enantioselectivity enhancements result from accelerating the transformation of the major enantiomer through attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) rather than retarding the transformation of the minor isomer through repulsive steric forces.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The factors responsible for the kinetic resolution of alcohols by chiral pyridine derivatives have been elucidated by measurements of relative rates for a set of substrates with systematically growing aromatic side chains using accurate competitive linear regression analysis. Increasing the side chain size from phenyl to pyrenyl results in a rate acceleration of more than 40 for the major enantiomer. Based on this observation a new catalyst with increased steric bulk has been designed that gives enantioselectivity values of up to  s  = 250. Extensive conformational analysis of the relevant transition states indicates that alcohol attack to the more crowded side of the acyl&#8208;catalyst intermediate is favoured due to stabilizing CH&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Experimental and theoretical results imply that enantioselectivity enhancements result from accelerating the transformation of the major enantiomer through attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) rather than retarding the transformation of the minor isomer through repulsive steric forces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Towards Macroscopically Anisotropic Functionality: Oriented Metallo&#8208;supramolecular Polymeric Materials Induced by Magnetic Fields</title>

      <title>Exploring the Organometallic Route to Molecular Spin Qubits: the [CpTi(cot)] case</title>
      <dc:description>The coherence time of the 17&#8208;electron, mixed sandwich complex  [CpTi(cot)], (&#951;  8  &#8208;cyclooctatetraene)(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)&#8208; titanium, was found to reach 34 ms at 4.5 K in a frozen deuterated toluene solution. This result represents a remarkable coherence time for a highly protonated molecule. We here confirm that the intramolecular distances between the Ti and H atoms provide a good compromise between instantaneous and spin diffusion sources of decoherence. In addition,  ab initio  calculations at the molecular and crystal packing levels reveal that the characteristic low&#8208;energy ring rotations of the sandwich framework do not yield a detrimental spin&#8208;lattice relaxation because of their small spin&#8208;phonon coupling. Much shorter and almost temperature&#8208;independent phase memory times  T  m  were observed when [CpTi(cot)] was diluted in the diamagnetic (16&#8208;electron) crystalline host [CpTi(cht)], (&#951;  7  &#8208;cycloheptatrienyl)(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)titanium. Such finding reinforces the deactivating role of both intermolecular interactions involving the hydrogen atoms of neighboring molecules and cluster formation in the host crystal lattice. The volatility of [CpTi(cot)] and the accessibility of the semi&#8208;occupied, non&#8208;bonding d  z  2  orbital make this neutral compound an ideal candidate for single&#8208;qubit addressing on surface and quantum sensing in combination with scanning probe microscopies.</dc:description>

      <title>An amphiphilic sulfonatocalix[5]arene as a novel activator for membrane transport of lysine&#8208;rich peptides and proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Lysine (K) is an important target residue for protein and peptide delivery across membranes. K is the most frequently exposed residue in proteins, leading to high demand for the development of K&#8208;specific transport activators. However, designing activators for K&#8208;rich peptides and proteins is more challenging than for arginine&#8208;rich species because of the kosmotropic nature of K and its recognition difficulty. In this study, we designed a new amphiphilic sulfonatocalix[5]arene (sCx5&#8208;6C) as a K&#8208;specific transport activator. sCx5&#8208;6C was tailored with two key elements, recognition of K and the ability to embed into membranes. We measured the membrane transport efficiencies of &#945;&#8208;poly&#8208;  l  &#8208;lysine, heptalysine, and histones across artificial membranes and of &#945;&#8208;poly&#8208;  l  &#8208;lysine into live cells, activated by sCx5&#8208;6C. The results demonstrate that sCx5&#8208;6C acts as an efficient activator for translocating K&#8208;rich peptides and proteins, which cannot be achieved by known arginine&#8208;specific activators.</dc:description>

      <title>The &#8216;Hidden&#8217; Reductive [2 + 2 + 1]&#8208;Cycloaddition Chemistry of 2&#8208;Phosphaethynolate Revealed by Reduction of a Th&#8208;OCP Linkage</title>
      <dc:description>The reduction chemistry of the newly emerging 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate (OCP)&#8722; is not well explored, and there remains many unanswered questions about this ligand in this context. Here, we report that reduction of [Th(TrenTIPS)(OCP)] (2, TrenTIPS = [N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)]3&#8722;) with RbC8 produces via [2 + 2 + 1] cycloaddition an unprecedented hexathorium complex [{Th(TrenTIPS)}6(m&#8208;OC2P3)2(m&#8208;OC2P3H)2Rb4] (5) featuring four five&#8208;membered [C2P3] phosphorus&#8208;heterocycles, which can be converted to a rare oxo [{Th(TrenTIPS)(&#956;&#8208;ORb)}2] (6) and the known cyclometallated complex [Th{N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)2(CH2CH2SiPri2CHMeCH2)}] (4) by thermolysis, providing an unprecedented example of reductive cycloaddition reactivity in the chemistry of 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate. This has permitted us to isolate intermediates which might normally remain unseen leading to the erroneous assumption of a concerted fragmentation process for (OCP)&#8208; and not cycloaddition products that then decompose with [Th(TrenTIPS)O]&#8722; essentially acting as a protecting&#8208; then leaving&#8208;group. In contrast, when KC8 or CsC8 are used, the phosphinidiide C&#8208;H bond activation product [{Th(TrenTIPS)}Th{N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)2[CH2CH2SiPri2CH(Me)CH2C(O)m&#8208;P]}] (3) and the oxo complex [{Th(TrenTIPS)(&#956;&#8208;OCs)}2] (7) were isolated.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>It is commonly considered that Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibrils are heavily involved in the neurological diseases. Establishing an external model based on the core recognition motif (diphenylalanine, FF) of A&#946; would be of significance in understanding the assembly and disassembly of A&#946; fibrils in living system. Herein, supramolecular gels with structure transition from amyloid&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;sheet to different supramolecular helices were obtained through the co&#8208;assembly of a N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected L&#8208;FF (L&#8208;FmocFF) with achiral pyridine derivatives. It is found that the different stacking modes (H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregates) of additives and the microenvironment of chiral carbon play vital roles for the selectively chiral transfer or amplification of L&#8208;FmocFF. The dynamic process of helix formation was also captured.

      <dc:description>
A stable and recyclable non&#8208;porous azobenzene&#8208;based organic cage (AZO&#8208;Cage) that exhibits exclusive selectivity towards p&#8208;xylene (pX) compared to all C8 isomers is reported by N.&#8197;M.

This AZO&#8208;Cage undergoes a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition selectively in the presence of pX in both liquid and vapor phase, which makes this platform ideal for eventual translation for the separation of high value benzene derivatives. The cover image illustrates the host cage crystal transition in the presence of pX guest molecules.

      <title>Biomedical Applications of Calixarenes: State of the Art and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>

Abstract
Calixarenes (CAs), representing the third generation of supramolecular hosts and one of the most widely studied macrocyclic scaffolds, offer (almost) unlimited structure and application possibilities due to their ease of modification, which allows one to establish a large molecular library as a material basis for diverse biomedical applications. Moreover, CAs and their derivatives engage in various noncovalent interactions for the facile recognition of guests including bioactive molecules and are also important building blocks for the fabrication of supramolecular architectures. In view of their molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly properties, CAs are extensively applied in biosensing, bioimaging, and drug/gene delivery. Additionally, some CA derivatives exhibit biological activities and can therefore be used as new therapeutic agents. Herein, we summarize the diverse biomedical applications of CAs including in vitro diagnosis (biosensing), in vivo diagnosis (bioimaging), and therapy.

      <title>Sequential Chiral Induction and Regulator&#8208;assisted Chiral Memory of Pillar[5]arenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Chirality transfer is widely observed in life processes. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010050), T. Ogoshi and co&#8208;workers introduce a new non&#8208;direct chiral transfer system, in which the chiral induction and memory processes within a single system via the synergistic interactions of a chiral regulator and inducer. The inducer induces planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes, and the regulator memorizes the planar chirality. Memorization of the planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes by the regulator (net) is illustrated.

Abstract
Severe side effects and poor therapeutic efficacy are the main drawbacks of current anticancer drugs. These problems can be mitigated by targeting, but the targeting efficacy of current drugs is poor and urgently needs improvement. Taking this into consideration, this Review first summarizes the current targeting strategies for cancer therapy in terms of cancer tissue and organelles. Then, we analyse the systematic targeting of anticancer drugs and conclude that a typical journey for a targeted drug administered by intravenous injection is a CTIO cascade of at least four steps. Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented. This review could actively promote the development of precision medicine against cancer.

Then, we analyse the systematic targeting of anticancer drugs and conclude that a typical journey for a targeted drug administered by intravenous injection is a CTIO cascade of at least four steps. Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented. This review could actively promote the development of precision medicine against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
From the time of Luis Pasteur circular polarized light has found many applications in chemical analysis and spectroscopy. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011146), J. Kapit&#225;n, Y. Xu, P. Bou&#345; et&#8197;al. report another modality, interference of Raman optical activity and circular dichroism, occurring during measurement of transition metal complexes.

      <title>Water&#8208;Stable DMASnBr3 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite for Effective Solar&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Water&#8208;stable metal halide perovskites could foster tremendous progresses in several research fields where their superior optical properties can make differences. In this work we report clear evidence of water stability in a lead&#8208;free metal halide perovskite, namely DMASnBr3, obtained by means of diffraction, optical and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Such unprecedented water&#8208;stability has been applied to promote photocatalysis in aqueous medium, in particular by devising a novel composite material by coupling DMASnBr3 to g&#8208;C3N4, taking advantage from the combination of their optimal photophysical properties. The prepared composites provide an impressive hydrogen evolution rate &gt;1700 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 generated by the synergistic activity of the two composite costituents. DFT calculations provide insight into this enhancement deriving it from the favorable alignment of interfacial energy levels of DMASnBr3 and g&#8208;C3N4.

      <title>Cobalt@Cucurbit[5]uril Complex as Highly Efficient Supramolecular Catalyst for Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>A host&#8208;guest complex self&#8208;assembled through Co  2+  cation and Cucurbit[5]uril (Co@CB[5]) is used as a supramolecular catalyst on the surface of metal oxides including porous indium tin oxide (ITO) and porous bismuth vanadate (BiVO  4  ) for efficient electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Characterization techniques including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy and corresponding EDS elemental mapping were applied to confirm the immobilization of Co@CB[5] complex on the surface of metal oxides. When immobilized on ITO, Co@CB[5] exhibited an impressive turn over frequency (TOF) of 9.9 s  &#8211;1  at overpotential &#951; = 550 mV in a pH 9.2 borate buffer. Meanwhile, when Co@CB[5] complex was immobilized onto the surface of BiVO  4  semiconductor, the assembled Co@CB[5]/BiVO  4  photoanode exhibited a low onset potential of 0.15 V (vs. RHE) and a high photocurrent of 4.8 mA cm  &#8722;2  at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) under 100 mW cm  &#8722;2  (AM 1.5) light illumination. Kinetic studies confirmed that Co@CB[5] acts as a supramolecular water oxidation catalyst, and can effectively accelerate interfacial charge transfer between BiVO  4  and electrolyte. At the same time, the surface charge recombination of BiVO  4  can be also significantly suppressed by Co@CB[5].

      <title>A Dinickel Catalyzed Cyclopropanation without the Formation of a Metal Carbene Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>(NDI)Ni2  catalysts (NDI = naphthyridine&#8211;diimine) promote cyclopropanation reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes using (Me3Si)CHN2  . Mechanistic studies reveal that a metal carbene intermediate is not part of the catalytic cycle. The (NDI)Ni2(CHSiMe3) complex was independently synthesized and found to be unreactive toward dienes. Based on DFT models, we propose an alternative mechanism that begins with a Ni2&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling of (Me3Si)CHN2  and the diene. N2  extrusion followed by radical C&#8211;C bond formation generates the cyclopropane product. This model reproduces the experimentally observed regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Alternative Oxidants for the Catalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O  2  &#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to CO  x  products. Other gaseous reagents such as N  2  O, CO  2  , and S  2  have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O  2  . Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X&#8208;OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N  2  O, CO  2  , S  2  , and other non&#8208;O  2  oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O  2  &#8208;OCM. Current outlook and potential areas for future study are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Flow Photochemistry for Single&#8208;Chain Polymer Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Single chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNP) constitute an attractive polymer architecture that potentially provides functions exclusively seen in folded biomacromolecules. The generation of SCNPs, however, is limited by the requirement of a high dilution chemical step, necessitating the use of large reactors in order to produce reasonable quantities of material. Herein, the chemical folding of macromolecules into SCNPs is achieved in both batch and flow photochemical processes by the previously described photodimerization of anthracene units in polymethylmethacrylate (100 kDa) under UV irradiation at 366 nm. When employing flow chemistry, the irradiation time is readily controlled by tuning the flow rates, allowing for the precise control over the intramolecular collapse process. In addition, we demonstrate that the flow system provides a route at least 4 times more efficient for SCNPs formation, reaching higher intramolecular cross&#8208;linking ratios 5 times faster compared to batch operation. Thus, we provide a new path towards the synthesis of larger quantities of SCNPs and thus their applications in different fields of soft matter materials science.</dc:description>

      <title>Large polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane cages &#8211; the isolation of functionalized POSS with an unprecedented Si18O27 core</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of organo&#8209;functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS, (R&#8209;SiO1.5)n, Tn) is currently an area of significant activity. To date, T14 is the largest such cage synthesized and isolated as a single isomer. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of an unprecedented, single&#8208;isomer styryl&#8209;functionalized T18 POSS. Unambiguously identified among nine possible isomers by multinuclear solution NMR (1H, 13C and 29Si), MALDI&#8208;MS, FTIR and computational studies, this represents the largest single&#8209;isomer functionalized Tn compound isolated to date.

&#160;A ring strain model was developed to correlate the 29Si resonances with the number of six&#8209;, five&#8209; and/or four&#8209;Si&#8209;atom rings that each non&#8209;equivalent Si atom is part of. The model successfully predicts the speciation of non&#8209;equivalent Si atoms in other families of Tn compounds, demonstrating its general applicability for assigning 29Si resonances to silicon atoms in cage silsesquioxanes and providing a useful tool for predicting silicon&#8208;atom environments.</dc:description>

      <title>Anisotropic Seeded Growth of Ag Nanoplates Confined in Shape&#8208;Deformable Spaces</title>
      <dc:description>Conventional templating synthesis confines the growth of seeds in rigid spaces to achieve faithful morphological replication. Herein, we explore the use of spherical shape&#8208;deformable polymeric nanoshells to regulate the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates. The flexible shells deform adaptively to accommodate the initial overgrowth of the seeds but restrict the growth in the directions where the shells are fully stretched, eventually producing nanoplates with an unconventional circular profile.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conventional templating synthesis confines the growth of seeds in rigid spaces to achieve faithful morphological replication. Herein, we explore the use of spherical shape&#8208;deformable polymeric nanoshells to regulate the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates. The flexible shells deform adaptively to accommodate the initial overgrowth of the seeds but restrict the growth in the directions where the shells are fully stretched, eventually producing nanoplates with an unconventional circular profile. The diameter of the final Ag nanoplates can be precisely predicted by stretching and flattering the nanoshells into a plate&#8208;like capsule while retaining their original internal surface area. Further, unlike conventional templates, the polymer shells eventually turn themselves into a conformal coating that binds to the surface of the full&#8208;grown Ag nanoplates and significantly enhances their stability against oxidative etching.

      <title>Light&#8208;switched reversible emulsification and demulsification of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water Pickering emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Pickering emulsions have been shown to be an excellent platform for interfacial catalysis. However, developing simple and efficient strategies to achieve the goal of product separation and catalyst and emulsifier recovery is still a challenge. Herein, we report for the first time the switchable transition between emulsification and demulsification triggered by UV and visible light in a novel class of light&#8208;responsive Pickering emulsions fabricated from Pd supported silica nanoparticles, azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant, n&#8208;octane and water. It is shown that light&#8208;switchable emulsification and demulsification of the Pickering emulsions is attributed to the adsorption of azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant on the surface of the nanoparticles and the light switched surface activity of the ionic liquid surfactant. This feature enables the Pickering emulsion to be used as an easily controlled micro&#8208;reactor with the functions of catalytic reaction, product separation as well as emulsifier and catalyst recycling. As an example, highly efficient catalytic hydrogenation of some unsaturated hydrocarbons at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has been performed in this system, with product separation and emulsifier and catalyst re&#8208;use achievable in a simple way.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallographic analysis of NifB with a full complement of clusters: Structural insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion during nitrogenase cofactor assembly</title>
      <dc:description>NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Here we report the crystal structures of  Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum  NifB without (apo  Mt  NifB) and with (holo  Mt  NifB) a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters. Both apo and holo  Mt  NifB contain a partial TIM barrel core; yet, unlike apo  Mt  NifB that is structurally disordered outside the TIM barrel, holo  Mt  NifB is fully assembled and competent in cofactor biosynthesis. Of the three [Fe4S4] clusters in holo  Mt  NifB, the canonical radical SAM (RS)&#8208;cluster, like those in other radical SAM enzymes, is coordinated by three Cys ligands; whereas the adjacently positioned K1&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters, representing the precursor to an 8Fe cofactor core, are each coordinated by one His and two Cys ligands. Prediction of substrate channels, combined with  in silico  docking of SAM in holo  Mt  NifB, suggests plausible binding of SAM between the RS&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters and putative paths for entry of SAM and exit of products of SAM cleavage, thereby providing important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with cofactor core formation.</dc:description>

Specifically, we identify highly potent and selective photoswitchable inhibitors of the drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes carboxylesterases 1 and 2 and demonstrate the pharmacological application of our compounds by optically controlling the metabolism of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate mofetil. Collectively, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study provides a first example of photopharmacological tools to optically control drug metabolism by modulating the activity of a metabolizing enzyme. Our arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones offer synthetically accessible scaffolds that can be expanded to a larger library with hundreds of compounds to identify specific photoswitchable inhibitors for other serine hydrolases, including lipases, peptidases, and proteases and our chemoproteomic platform can be expanded to other photoswitches and scaffolds to achieve optical control over diverse protein classes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied over the past few decades due to their well&#8208;defined, customizable, and porous structures. However, the limited stability and machinability restrict their particle applications. Recently, a new trend to use hybrid strategies to bridge the gap between CPMs and flexible polymers has emerged as an effective solution to tackle the above issues.

      <title>Does Molecular Catalyst Selectivity Change with Time? Polymerization Imaged via Single&#8208;Molecule Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The chemoselectivity of molecular catalysts underpins much of modern synthetic organic chemistry.&#160;&#160;Yet little is known about the selectivity of individual catalysts because this single&#8208;catalyst&#8208;level behavior is hidden by the bulk catalytic behavior. Here, for the first time, the selectivity of individual molecular catalysts for two different reactions is imaged in real time at the single&#8208;catalyst level. This imaging is achieved through fluorescence microscopy paired with spectral probes that produce a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the instantaneous chemoselectivity of a single catalyst for either a single&#8208;chain&#8208;elongation or a single&#8208;chain&#8208;termination event during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization. Superresolution imaging of multiple selectivity events, each at a different single&#8208;molecular ruthenium catalyst, indicates that catalyst selectivity may be unexpectedly spatial&#8208; and time&#8208;variable.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The chemoselectivity of molecular catalysts underpins much of modern synthetic organic chemistry.&#160;&#160;Yet little is known about the selectivity of individual catalysts because this single&#8208;catalyst&#8208;level behavior is hidden by the bulk catalytic behavior. Here, for the first time, the selectivity of individual molecular catalysts for two different reactions is imaged in real time at the single&#8208;catalyst level. This imaging is achieved through fluorescence microscopy paired with spectral probes that produce a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the instantaneous chemoselectivity of a single catalyst for either a single&#8208;chain&#8208;elongation or a single&#8208;chain&#8208;termination event during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization. Superresolution imaging of multiple selectivity events, each at a different single&#8208;molecular ruthenium catalyst, indicates that catalyst selectivity may be unexpectedly spatial&#8208; and time&#8208;variable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>MicroED Elucidation of Diverse Solid&#8208;State Packing in a Family of Electron&#8208;Deficient Expanded Helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state packing plays a defining role in the properties of a molecular organic material, but it is difficult to elucidate in the absence of single crystals that are suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction. Here, we demonstrate the coupling of divergent synthesis with microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) for rapid assessment of solid&#8208;state packing motifs, using a class of chiral nanocarbons &#8211; expanded helicenes &#8211; as a proof of concept. Two highly selective oxidative dearomatizations of a readily&#8208;accessible helicene provided a divergent route to four electron&#8208;deficient analogues containing quinone or quinoxaline units. Crystallization efforts consistently yielded microcrystals that were unsuitable for single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, but ideal for MicroED. This technique facilitated the elucidation of solid&#8208;state structures of all five compounds with &lt;1.1 &#197; resolution. The otherwise&#8208;inaccessible data revealed a range of notable packing behavior, including four different space groups, homochirality in a crystal for a helicene with an extremely low enantiomerization barrier, and nanometer scale cavities. The results of this study suggest that MicroED will soon become an indispensable tool for high&#8208;throughput investigations in pursuit of next&#8208;generation organic materials.</dc:description>
