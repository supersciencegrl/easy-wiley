         <title>An Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Controllable Efficiency Enabled by an Annulene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Fluid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An annulene&#8208;based discotic liquid crystal (LC) material to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform is developed. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of the LC molecule with variable molecular order, the efficiency of the light&#8208;harvesting system can be controlled at different temperatures when Nile red is introduced as an acceptor. This system exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio.







Abstract
The development of controllable artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials, i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene&#8208;based discotic LC compound 6 with a saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform. The LC material shows a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which can act as a suitable light&#8208;harvesting donor. By loading Nile red (NiR) as an acceptor, an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system is achieved. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of 6 with variable molecular order, the efficiency of such 6&#8208;NiR system can be controlled by temperature. This light&#8208;harvesting system works sensitively at a high donor/acceptor ratio as 1000&#8201;:&#8201;1, and exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio. This thermochromic artificial light&#8208;harvesting LC system could find potential applications in smart devices employing soft materials.

         <title>Biomimetic FeMo(Se, Te) as Joint Electron Pool Promoting Nitrogen Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogenase&#8208;inspired FeMo(Se, Te) catalysts have been theoretically predicted and experimentally synthesized. They exhibit remarkable structural features of joint electron pool for promoting N2 electrofixation.







Abstract
It has been long believed that the FeMoS structure, where Fe is bonded with S, plays a pivotal role as a biomimetic catalyst for electrochemical nitrogen (N2) fixation. Nevertheless, the structure of Fe bonded to heavier analogues (Se or Te) has never been explored for N2 electrofixation. Here, we theoretically predict the electronic structure of FeMo(Se, Te) composed of tri&#8208;coordinated Fe species with open shells for binding with Se, which forms a joint electron pool for promoting N2 activation. Guided by this interesting prediction, we then demonstrate a two&#8208;step procedure to synthesize such structures, which display remarkable N2 electrofixation activities with an ammonia yield of 72.54&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradic efficiency of 51.67&#8201;% that are more than three times of the FeMoS counterpart. Further mechanism studies have been conducted by density function theory (DFT) simulations. This work provides new clues for designing versatile electrocatalytic materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization.

         <title>Chemoselective Transamidation of Thioamides by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free N&#8722;C(S) Transacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general, mild and highly chemoselective method for transamidation of thioamides by N&#8722;C(S) transacylation is reported. This process exploits the concept of site&#8208;selective N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl activation, resulting in ground&#8208;state&#8208;destabilization of thioamides. The study establishes a powerful direction to the development of new molecules in chemistry and biology by rational modification of nN&#8594;&#960;*C=S resonance of the thioamide bond.







Abstract
Thioamides represent highly valuable isosteric in the strictest sense &#8220;single&#8208;atom substitution&#8221; analogues of amides that have found broad applications in chemistry and biology. A long&#8208;standing challenge is the direct transamidation of thioamides, a process which would convert one thioamide bond (R&#8722;C(S)&#8722;NR1R2) into another (R&#8722;C(S)&#8722;NR3N4). Herein, we report the first general method for the direct transamidation of thioamides by highly chemoselective N&#8722;C(S) transacylation. The method relies on site&#8208;selective N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl activation of 2&#176; and 1&#176; thioamides, resulting in ground&#8208;state&#8208;destabilization of thioamides, thus enabling to rationally manipulate nucleophilic addition to the thioamide bond. This method showcases a remarkably broad scope including late&#8208;stage functionalization (&gt;100 examples). We further present extensive DFT studies that provide insight into the chemoselectivity and provide guidelines for the development of transamidation methods of the thioamide bond.

         <title>Multicolour Fluorescence Based on Excitation&#8208;Dependent Electron Transfer Processes in o&#8208;Carborane Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) approach to construct dual&#8208;fluorescence materials is presented. Impressively, the o&#8208;carborane dyads show multicolour fluorescence from single molecules due to the competition of nonradiative relaxation channels between internal conversion (IC) and PeT. Importantly, the multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this dyad are well demonstrated.







Abstract
Organic materials with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;de) emission are highly attractive for anticounterfeiting, optoelectronics and bioassay applications; however, the realization of Ex&#8208;de fluorescence, independent of aggregation states, remains a challenge. We herein report a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) strategy to design Ex&#8208;de fluorescence materials by manipulating the relaxation pathways of multiple excited states. As expected, the o&#8208;carborane dyad presents a clear Ex&#8208;de fluorescence colour in the aggregated states, resulting from the tunable relative intensity of the dual&#8208;fluorescence spectra. Taking TP[1]B as an example, the amorphous powders emitted bright blue&#8208;violet, white and yellow colours under 390&#8197;nm, 365&#8197;nm and 254&#8197;nm UV illumination, respectively. Importantly, multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this o&#8208;carborane dyad are demonstrated.

         <title>Coloration in Supraparticles Assembled from Polyhedral Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supraparticles exhibiting coloration and high structural order are assembled from four different uniform, polyhedral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) particles. In these supraparticles, the macroscopic color originates from constructive interference of light reflected at ordered surface layers of the polyhedral particles.







Abstract
Supraparticles are spherical colloidal crystals prepared by confined self&#8208;assembly processes. A particularly appealing property of these microscale structures is the structural color arising from interference of light with their building blocks. Here, we assemble supraparticles with high structural order that exhibit coloration from uniform, polyhedral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) particles. We analyse the structural coloration as a function of the size of these anisotropic building blocks and their internal structure. We attribute the angle&#8208;dependent coloration of the MOF supraparticles to the presence of ordered, onion&#8208;like layers at the outermost regions. Surprisingly, even though different shapes of the MOF particles have different propensities to form these onion layers, all supraparticle dispersions show well&#8208;visible macroscopic coloration, indicating that local ordering is sufficient to generate interference effects.

         <title>Tuning Bulk O2 and Nonbonding Oxygen State for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in P2&#8208;Layered Cathodes</title>

How to improve the reversibility of O&#8208;redox chemistry is particularly important for P2&#8208;type layered cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for the reversible O&#8208;redox in P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 has been successfully tuned through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. The underlying mechanism has been revealed by neutron diffraction, resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering, density functional theory, etc.







Abstract
Improving the reversibility of oxygen redox is quite significant for layered oxides cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we for the first time simultaneously tune bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for reversible oxygen redox chemistry in P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. O2&#8722; is oxidized to molecular O2 and peroxide (O2)n&#8722; (n&lt;2) during charging. Molecular O2 derived from transition metal (TM) migration is related to the superstructure ordering induced by Li doping. The synergy mechanism of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping on the two O&#8208;redox modes is revealed. Firstly, Li2TiO3 coating restrains the surface O2 and inhibits O2 loss. Secondly, nonbonding Li&#8722;O&#8722;Na enhances the reversibility of O2&#8722;&#8594;(O2)n&#8722;. Thirdly, Ti doping strengthens the TM&#8722;O bond which fixes lattice oxygen. The cationic redox reversibility is also enhanced by Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. The proposed insights into the oxygen redox reversibility are insightful for other oxide cathodes.

A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, was developed for visualizing intracellular viscosity change and immediately predicting therapeutic efficacy of tumour turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy.







Abstract
We present a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, for acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy (PTT), followed by viscosity based therapeutic efficacy evaluation by itself in two independent channels, denoted as &#8220;self&#8208;checking&#8221; strategy. In acidic TME, LET&#8208;1052 was protonated and turned on NIR&#8208;II absorption for PTT under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, PTT&#8208;induced cellular death increases intracellular viscosity, which inhibited the intramolecular rotation of LET&#8208;1052, resulting in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;I fluorescence for real&#8208;time evaluation of PTT efficacy. After PTT of tumor&#8208;bearing mice for different periods of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, NIR&#8208;I fluorescence in the tumor region showed positive correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, demonstrating reliable and prompt prediction of PTT efficacy. The strategy may be expanded for instant evaluation of other therapeutic modalities for personalized medicine.

         <title>Controlled Disassembly of Elemental Sulfur: An Approach to the Precise Synthesis of Polydisulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for controlling the orderly disassembly of elemental sulfur (S8) in the presence of MTBD (a hindered organic base) and [PPN]SbF6 (an ammonium salt) is described for constructing polydisulfides by copolymerizing with episulfides. The &#8220;living polymerization&#8221; feature and good monomer compatibility of this copolymerization allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides with well&#8208;defined structures and excellent optical properties.







Abstract
The usage of elemental sulfur (S8) for constructing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers is of great significance in terms of sulfur resource utilization or fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymers. Currently, the random disassembly of S8 hinders its direct use in the precise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. Herein, we provide an effective strategy for controlling the dismantlement of S8 to synthesize polydisulfides, a promising category of dynamic bonds containing polymers. In this strategy, the completely alternating copolymerization of one sulfur atom, which is orderly derived from S8, with episulfides is achieved with MTBD (7&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) as catalyst and [PPN]SbF6 ([PPN]+ is bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) as cocatalyst. Delightedly, the living&#8208; polymerization feature, and the good monomer compatibility allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to elaborate the copolymerization process.

         <title>Streamline Sulfur Redox Reactions to Achieve Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering CoS2 as electron reservoirs overcomes the limited length of the electron diffusion tunnel over an insulating sulfur cathode and thus achieves fast reaction kinetics in sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. With the assistance of Co1 single atoms, this strategy provides streamlined redox paths, which reduce the formation of unstable polysulfides and enable stable sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT/Na&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double&#8208;end binding sites for a stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS2 electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short&#8208;chain sodium polysulfides (Na2S4) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long&#8208;chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability.

&lt;p&gt;Engineering CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as electron reservoirs overcomes the limited length of the electron diffusion tunnel over an insulating sulfur cathode and thus achieves fast reaction kinetics in sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. With the assistance of Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; single atoms, this strategy provides streamlined redox paths, which reduce the formation of unstable polysulfides and enable stable sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room-temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT/Na&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double-end binding sites for a stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short-chain sodium polysulfides (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long-chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as-developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a high cycling capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 5000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Support&#8208;Free PEDOT:PSS Fibers as Multifunctional Microelectrodes for In Vivo Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS fibers and multifunctional microelectrodes based on them, which are mechanically compliant with neural tissues and exhibit significantly reduced foreign body responses, are developed not only for spatiotemporal neurochemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace in neural microcircuits, but also for neuromodulation by current&#8208;regulated electrostimulation.







Abstract
In vivo microelectrodes are essential for neuroscience studies. However, development of microelectrodes with both flexibility and multifunctionality for recording chemical and electrical signals in the same extracellular microspace and modulating neural activity remains challenging. Here, we find that pure PEDOT:PSS fibers (i.e., support&#8208;free) exhibit high conductivity, fast heterogeneous electron transfer, and suitable charge storage and injection capabilities, and can thus directly act as microelectrodes not only for chemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace, but also for electromodulation of neural microcircuit activity. Moreover, the microelectrodes mechanically match with neural tissues, exhibiting less foreign body responses. Given the multifunctionality, flexibility, and biocompatibility, the support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based microelectrodes offer a new avenue to microelectrode technology for neuroscience research, diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>A Polymeric Nanobeacon for Monitoring the Fluctuation of Hydrogen Polysulfides during Fertilization and Embryonic Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluctuation of hydrogen polysulfide during the early embryonic development is revealed by a polymeric nanobeacon. A maximal level of H2Sn exists in the preliminary stage of embryogenesis, then the expression level of H2Sn was down&#8208;regulated with the development of the embryo.







Abstract
Fertilization and early embryonic development as the beginning of a new life are key biological events. Hydrogen polysulfide (H2Sn) plays important roles during physiological regulation, such as antioxidation&#8208;protection. However, no report has studied in situ H2Sn fluctuation during early embryonic development because of the low abundance of H2Sn and inadequate sensitivity of probes. We herein construct a polymeric nanobeacon from a H2Sn&#8208;responsive polymer and fluorophores, which is capable of detecting H2Sn selectively and of signal amplification. Taking the zebrafish as a model, the polymeric nanobeacon revealed that the H2Sn level was significantly elevated after fertilization due to the activation of cell multiplication, suppressed partially during embryonic development, and finally kept steady up to zebrafish emergence. This strategy is generally accessible for biomarkers by altering the responsive unit and significant for facilitating biological analysis during life development.

         <title>Engineering MoOx/MXene Hole Transfer Layers for Unexpected Boosting of Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene quantum dots were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst was constructed as a promising model system of an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE, but also remarkably enhances photostability.







Abstract
The development of semiconductor photoanodes is of great practical interest for the realization of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, MXene quantum dots (MQD) were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer by combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.

         <title>Alkylgold(III) Complexes Undergo Unprecedented Photo&#8208;Induced &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination and Reduction for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylgold(III) complexes containing glucose moieties were identified to undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and reduction, leading to cancer&#8208;selective cellular uptake, potent inhibition on thioredoxin reductase, up to 400&#8208;fold increase of cytotoxicity in vitro, and strong antiangiogenic and anti&#8208;tumor activities in two animal models.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controllable activation of prodrugs within tumors is highly desirable for cancer therapy to minimize toxic side effects. Herein we report that stable alkylgold(III) complexes can undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, releasing alkyl ligands and forming gold(III)&#8208;hydride intermediates that could be quickly converted into bioactive [AuIII&#8722;S] adducts; meanwhile, the remaining alkylgold(III) complexes can photo&#8208;catalytically reduce [AuIII&#8722;S] into more bioactive AuI species. Such photo&#8208;reactivities make it possible to functionalize gold complexes on the auxiliary alkyl ligands without attenuating the metal&#8211;biomacromolecule interactions. As a result, the gold(III) complexes containing glucose&#8208;functionalized alkyl ligands displayed efficient and tumor&#8208;selective uptake; notably, after one&#8208; or two&#8208;photon activation, the complexes exhibited high thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition, potent cytotoxicity, and strong antiangiogenesis and antitumor activities in vivo.

         <title>Combining a Genetically Engineered Oxidase with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) for Highly Efficient Biocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immobilization of d&#8208;amino acid oxidase in crystalline frameworks at high protein loading is reported. A biocomposite of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (BioHOF&#8208;1) shows excellent retention of activity. Fusion to the positively charged module Zbasic2 (Z&#8208;DAAO) promotes incorporation of the active enzyme. Protein engineering can facilitate development of framework&#8208;based enzyme composites, as shown with three further examples of industrial enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes incorporated into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bottom&#8208;up synthesis are promising biocomposites for applications in catalysis and sensing. Here, we explored synthetic incorporation of d&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) with the metal&#8208;free tetraamidine/tetracarboxylate&#8208;based BioHOF&#8208;1 in water. N&#8208;terminal enzyme fusion with the positively charged module Zbasic2 strongly boosted the loading (2.5&#8208;fold; &#8776;500&#8197;mg enzyme gmaterial&#8722;1) and the specific activity (6.5&#8208;fold; 23&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1). The DAAO@BioHOF&#8208;1 composites showed superior activity with respect to every reported carrier for the same enzyme and excellent stability during catalyst recycling. Further, extension to other enzymes, including cytochrome P450 BM3 (used in the production of high&#8208;value oxyfunctionalized compounds), points to the versatility of genetic engineering as a strategy for the preparation of biohybrid systems with unprecedented properties.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Hyperforin and Pyrohyperforin</title>

         <dc:description>
A 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of both (+)&#8208;hyperforin and its pyran congener (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin is described herein. The synthesis highlights a late&#8208;stage 1,3&#8208;diene diversification, including an abiotic cyclization cascade for pyran formation, and a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes.







Abstract
Capitalizing on the late&#8208;stage diversification of an essential 1,3&#8208;diene intermediate, we describe herein a 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;hyperforin and (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin, starting from commercially available allylacetone. Our convergent synthesis features a series of critical reactions: 1) an enantioselective deconjugative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acid using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries; 2) a HfCl4&#8208;mediated carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework; 3) an abiotic cascade pyran formation; and 4) a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes. During the course of our synthesis, we also identified a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropanediol overbred intermediate which was responsible for the 1,3&#8208;diene precursor formation through a controlled fragmentation.

         <title>Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Immunity by a Ferrocene&#8208;Appended Iridium(III) Diphosphine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have potential as antitumor candidates. A ferrocene&#8208;modified IrIII complex with Fenton&#8208;like catalytic activity is used to disturb the cellular redox balance, which leads to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis of cancer cells. Ferroptosis induced by the IrIII complex causes immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cell in&#8197;vitro, which enhances cancer immune response in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death pathway discovered in recent years, and ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have great potential as new antitumor candidates. Here, we report a IrIII complex (Ir1) containing a ferrocene&#8208;modified diphosphine ligand that localizes in lysosomes. Under the acidic environments of lysosomes, Ir1 can effectively catalyze Fenton&#8208;like reaction, produce hydroxyl radicals, induce lipid peroxidation, down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, and result in ferroptosis. RNA sequencing analysis shows that Ir1 can significantly affect pathways related to ferroptosis and cancer immunity. Accordingly, Ir1 can induce immunogenic cells death and suppress tumor growth in vitro, regulate T cell activity and immune microenvironments in vivo. In conclusion, we show the potential of small molecules with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities for effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO/CH4 Using a Metal&#8211;Organic &#8220;Soft&#8221; Coordination Polymer Gel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based coordination polymer gel (CPG) has been developed for visible/sunlight&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Notably, the product of CO2 reduction can be modulated by changing the sacrificial electron donor (SED). Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG upon photocatalytic CO2 reduction produces CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in presence of TEA as SED), whereas in presence of both BNAH and TEA as SED, Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG produces CH4 (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity).







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a well&#8208;defined and astutely designed, low&#8208;molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker with a suitable metal ion is a promising method for preparing photocatalytically active coordination polymer gels. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and gelation behaviour of a tetrapodal LMWG based on a porphyrin core connected to four terpyridine units (TPY&#8208;POR) through amide linkages. The self&#8208;assembly of TPY&#8208;POR LMWG with RuII ions results in a Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR coordination polymer gel (CPG), with a nanoscroll morphology. Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG exhibits efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial electron donor. Interestingly, in the presence of 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) with TEA as the sacrificial electron donor, the 8e&#8722;/8H+ photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 is realized with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). In CPG, porphyrin acts as a photosensitizer and covalently attached [Ru(TPY)2]2+ acts as a catalytic center as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Further, combining information from the in situ DRIFT spectroscopy and DFT calculation, a possible reaction mechanism for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4 was outlined.

         <title>Double Lock Label Based on Thermosensitive Polymer Hydrogels for Information Camouflage and Multilevel Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double lock encryption strategy with both temperature and time as keys and excellent comprehensive capabilities has been established via a combination of lower critical and upper critical solution temperature (LCST and UCST) thermosensitive polymer hydrogels, of which the phase transition temperature and time can be arbitrarily tailored by changing the contents of monomer and crosslinker in their networks. This strategy provides powerful double insurances for confidential information.







Abstract
Developing extra safety encryption technologies to prevent information leakage and combat fakes is in high demand but is challenging. Herein, we propose a &#8220;double lock&#8221; strategy based on both lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer hydrogels for information camouflage and multilevel encryption. Two types of hydrogels were synthesized by the method of random copolymerization. The number of &#8722;CO&#8722;NH2 groups in the network structure of the hydrogels changed the enthalpic or entropic thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels, and ultimately precisely controlled their phase transition temperature. The crosslink density of the polymer hydrogels governs the diffusion kinetics, resulting in a difference in the time for their color change. The combination of multiple LCST and UCST hydrogels in one label realized information encryption and dynamic information identification in the dimensions of both time and temperature. This work is highly interesting for the fields of information encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and smart responsive materials.

         <title>Extraordinary p&#8211;d Hybridization Interaction in Heterostructural Pd&#8208;PdSe Nanosheets Boosts C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile strain effect and extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction that co&#8208;exist on Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets could effectively boost the C&#8722;C bond breaking in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and enhance the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via a one&#8208;step approach. These Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structures, in which unconventional p&#8211;d hybridization interactions and tensile strain effect co&#8208;exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) fold enhancement of specific (mass) activity for the EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3&#8201;%, illustrating the superior C&#8722;C bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8722;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Alternating Conjugated Polymers Enabled by Room&#8208; Temperature Stille Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of conjugated polymers (CPs) often suffers from high temperature and indistinct homocoupling structural defects. In this study, the first room&#8208;temperature Stille cross&#8208;coupling polymerization was explored. Surprisingly, this method produced defect&#8208;free CPs, which enhanced their charge transport properties. Therefore, this work paves the road for the development of plastic electronics and optoelectronics.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling polymerization is one of the most efficient synthetic methods for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs). Nevertheless, thermal&#8208;activation Stille polymerization readily produced homocoupling defects, resulting in batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations in copolymers quality and deteriorating the device performance of electronics and optoelectronics. Here, a room&#8208;temperature Stille&#8208;type polymerization was developed, the utility and generality of which were demonstrated by synthesis of twelve D&#8211;A CPs with high molecular weights. Importantly, the resultant copolymers possessed no homocoupling (hc) structural defects, while hc reactions were observed in the thermal&#8208;activation Stille reactions. Thus, the organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on the former exhibited twofold higher charge transport mobility (2.10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), since it possessed stronger crystallinity and lower trap density of states (tDOS).

         <title>DNA&#8208;Damage&#8208;Response&#8208;Targeting Mitochondria&#8208;Activated Multifunctional Prodrug Strategy for Self&#8208;Defensive Tumor Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A new multifunctional construct M1 combining a floxuridine (FUDR) with a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor is presented. M1 targets the DNA damage response of cancer cells by inhibiting the PP2A activity and inducing mitochondrial and nucleus DNA damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis.







Abstract
We report a novel multifunctional construct, M1, designed explicitly to target the DNA damage response in cancer cells. M1 contains both a floxuridine (FUDR) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor combined with a GSH&#8208;sensitive linker. Further conjugation of the triphenylphosphonium moiety allows M1 to undergo specific activation in the mitochondria, where mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptosis is observed. Moreover, M1 has enormous effects on genomic DNA ascribed to FUDR's primary function of impeding DNA/RNA synthesis combined with diminishing PP2A&#8208;activated DNA repair pathways. Importantly, mechanistic studies highlight the PP2A obtrusion in FUDR/5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) therapy and underscore the importance of its inhibition to harbor therapeutic potential. HCT116 cell xenograft&#8208;bearing mice that have a low response rate to 5&#8208;FU show a prominent effect with M1, emphasizing the importance of DNA damage response targeting strategies using tumor&#8208;specific microenvironment&#8208;activatable systems.

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Activated Layered MoO3 Nanobelts as Biodegradable Nanozymes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous intercalation is proposed here as a promising strategy to activate the enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of layered MoO3 nanobelts for the generation of reactive oxygen species including &#8901;OH and &#8901;O2&#8722; in a tumor microenvironment, making it an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy.







Abstract
The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO3 nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO3 nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na+ and H2O to obtain the short Na+/H2O co&#8208;intercalated MoO3&#8722;x (NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x) nanobelts. In contrast to the inert MoO3 nanobelts, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.

     alt="Intercalation-Activated Layered MoO3 Nanobelts as Biodegradable Nanozymes for Tumor-Specific Photo-Enhanced Catalytic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous intercalation is proposed here as a promising strategy to activate the enzyme-mimicking catalytic activity of layered MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts for the generation of reactive oxygen species including &#8901;OH and &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in a tumor microenvironment, making it an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor-specific photo-enhanced catalytic therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor-specific photo-enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to obtain the short Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O co-intercalated MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (NH&#8722;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) nanobelts. In contrast to the inert MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts, the NH&#8722;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme-mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8722;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luciferin Synthesis and Pesticide Detection by Luminescence Enzymatic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic reactions were developed to convert 19 phenolic derivatives containing halogen, nitro, and methyl substituents into eight D&#8208;luciferin analogues, including the novel compounds 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin and 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin, which emit brighter and longer&#8208;wavelength light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. These reactions enabled the further development of luminescence technology for the sensitive detection of organophosphate pesticides.







Abstract
D&#8208;Luciferin (D&#8208;LH2), a substrate of firefly luciferase (Fluc), is important for a wide range of bioluminescence applications. This work reports a new and green method using enzymatic reactions (HELP, HadA Enzyme for Luciferin Preparation) to convert 19 phenolic derivatives to 8 D&#8208;LH2 analogues with &#8776;51&#8201;% yield. The method can synthesize the novel 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 and 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2, which have never been synthesized or found in nature. 5&#8242;&#8208;Methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 emits brighter and longer wavelength light than the D&#8208;LH2. Using HELP, we further developed LUMOS (Luminescence Measurement of Organophosphate and Derivatives) technology for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos, and fenitrothion by coupling the reactions of OPs hydrolase and Fluc. The LUMOS technology can detect these OPs at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. The method can directly detect OPs in food and biological samples without requiring sample pretreatment.

         <title>Unmasking the Critical Role of the Ordering Degree of Bimetallic Nanocatalysts on Oxygen Reduction Reaction by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>

The critical role of the ordering degree of AuCu bimetallic catalysts was studied in&#8197;situ by a shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy satellite strategy and the molecular reaction mechanism is revealed.







Abstract
Precise control and accurate understanding of the ordering degree of bimetallic nanocatalysts (BNs) are challenging yet crucial to acquire advanced materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). AuCu BNs with various ordering degrees were synthesized to evaluate the influence of ordering degree on the ORR at a molecular level using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. The activity of AuCu BNs was improved by over 2&#8197;times after a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition, making the performance of highly ordered AuCu BNs exceed that of benchmark Pt/C. Direct Raman spectroscopic evidence of key intermediate (*OH) demonstrates that the active site is the combination site of Au and Cu. Moreover, two distinct *OH species are observed on the ordered and disordered structure, and the ordered site is more beneficial for ORR due to its lower affinity to *OH. This work deepens the understanding on the important role of ordering degree on BNs and enables the design of improved catalysts.

         <title>Overturned Loading of Inert CeO2 to Active Co3O4 for Unusually Improved Catalytic Activity in Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique overturned loading strategy for the preparation of Co3O4 nanocomposites by loading inert CeO2 onto active Co3O4 is described. Such a design generates abundant surface oxygen vacancies neighboring Co and Ce as new active sites, resulting in unusually improved catalytic activity in both Fenton&#8208;like reaction and beyond, for instance, CO oxidation.







Abstract
In the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic activity of nanocomposites by either exposing more active sites or regulating the interaction between the support and nanoparticles while keeping the structure of the active sites unchanged. Here, we report the fabrication of a Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 nanocomposite via overturning the loading direction, i.e., loading an inert CeO2 support onto active Co3O4 nanoparticles. The resultant catalyst exhibits unexpectedly higher activity and stability in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reactions than its analog prepared by the traditional impregnation method. Abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov with a Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ce structure instead of Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov) are generated as new active sites to facilitate the cleavage of the peroxide bond to produce SO4.&#8722; and accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, i.e., the desorption of SO4.&#8722;, affording improved activity. This strategy is a new direction for boosting the catalytic activity of nanocomposite catalysts in various scenarios, including environmental remediation and energy applications.

         <title>Phosphorogenic Iridium(III) bis&#8208;Tetrazine Complexes for Bioorthogonal Peptide Stapling, Bioimaging, Photocytotoxic Applications, and the Construction of Nanosized Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel iridium(III) bis&#8208;tetrazine complexes that displayed significant phosphorogenic response toward (1R,8S,9s)&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) derivatives were synthesized and characterized. The complexes were exploited for peptide stapling and cross&#8208;labeling of BCN&#8208;modified peptides. They were also utilized in bioimaging, singlet oxygen photosensitization, and the construction of luminescent nanosized hydrogels.







Abstract
The dual functionality of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as a bioorthogonal reactive unit and a luminescence quencher has shaped tetrazine&#8208;based probes as attractive candidates for luminogenic labeling of biomolecules in living systems. In this work, three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes featuring two tetrazine units were synthesized and characterized. Upon photoexcitation, the complexes were non&#8208;emissive but displayed up to 3900&#8208;fold emission enhancement upon the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) [4+2] cycloaddition with (1R,8S,9s)&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) substrates. The rapid reaction kinetics (k2 up to 1.47&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) of the complexes toward BCN substrates allowed effective peptide labeling. The complexes were also applied as live cell bioimaging reagents and photocytotoxic agents. One of the complexes was utilized in the preparation of luminescent nanosized hydrogels that exhibited interesting cargo delivery properties.

&lt;p&gt;The dual functionality of 1,2,4,5-tetrazine as a bioorthogonal reactive unit and a luminescence quencher has shaped tetrazine-based probes as attractive candidates for luminogenic labeling of biomolecules in living systems. In this work, three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes featuring two tetrazine units were synthesized and characterized. Upon photoexcitation, the complexes were non-emissive but displayed up to 3900-fold emission enhancement upon the inverse electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) [4+2] cycloaddition with (1&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,8&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,9&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;)-bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-yne (BCN) substrates. The rapid reaction kinetics (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 1.47&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the complexes toward BCN substrates allowed effective peptide labeling. The complexes were also applied as live cell bioimaging reagents and photocytotoxic agents. One of the complexes was utilized in the preparation of luminescent nanosized hydrogels that exhibited interesting cargo delivery properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented and Readily Tunable Photoluminescence from Aliphatic Quaternary Ammonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions are observed from the solids of aliphatic quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), with &#934;c and &lt;&#964;&gt;p of up to 14.7&#8201;% and 762&#8197;ms, respectively. By adjusting the alkyl chain length/counterions or through physical blending and grinding, multicolor emissions from blue to orange&#8208;red and white are realized, which enables advanced multimode anticounterfeiting for QASs.







Abstract
Compounds bearing aliphatic amines can be emissive under appropriate conditions. However, their ionized counterparts, namely, quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), which are widely used as phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, ionic liquids, disinfectants, and surfactants, are known as luminescence quenchers and considered nonemissive. Herein, unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions from various QASs are reported, which can be finely regulated by changing the excitation wavelength, alkyl chain length, counterion, and mechanical stimuli. The bright photoluminescence along with distinct afterglow and tunable multicolor emissions enables the application of QAS solids in advanced multimode anticounterfeiting. This finding refreshes the understanding of QASs and may inspire emerging applications based on the utilization of the intrinsic luminescences of QASs. Furthermore, it opens opportunities for the investigation of QAS&#8208;related processes and functions via a photophysical approach and affords strong implications for the fabrication of novel nonconventional luminophores.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Norbornenylsilanes: Soluble Polymers with Controllable Molecular Properties via Siloxane Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse vulcanized polymers of norbornenylsilanes with hydrolysable chloro&#8208; and ethoxy substituents were prepared and polycondensated to install defined amounts of M, D, or T siloxane bonds. The MW and TG of the soluble and branched polymers containing 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% S could be varied systematically, whereas the elemental composition remained the same. Polymers with a sulfur content of 30&#8197;wt&#8201;% could be prepared without low molar mass impurities.







Abstract
The inverse vulcanization produces high sulfur content polymers from alkenes and elemental sulfur. Control over properties such as the molar mass or the solubility of polymers is not well established, and existing strategies lack predictability or require large variations of the composition. Systematic design principles are sought to allow for a targeted design of materials. Herein, we report on the inverse vulcanization of norbornenylsilanes (NBS), with a different number of hydrolysable groups at the silicon atom. Inverse vulcanization of mixtures of NBS followed by polycondensation yielded soluble high sulfur content copolymers (50&#8197;wt&#8201;% S) with controllable weight average molar mass (MW), polydispersity (&#272;), glass transition temperature (TG), or zero&#8208;shear viscosity (&#951;0). Polycondensation was conducted in the melt with HCl as a catalyst, abolishing the need for a solvent. Purification by precipitation afforded polymers with a greatly reduced amount of low molar mass species.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Notorious CO Poisoning of Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occupancy and energy of metal d electrons are the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory. These factors have an effect on CO poisoning with distinct scaling relationships. An increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption between CO and hydrogen, while a decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers the site coverage of CO to promote its association with oxygen.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is notorious for its strong adsorption to poison platinum group metal catalysts in the chemical industry. Here, we conceptually distinguish and quantify the effects of the occupancy and energy of d electrons, emerging as the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory, for CO poisoning of Pt nanocatalysts. The stepwise defunctionalization of carbon support is adopted to fine&#8208;tune the 5d electronic structure of supported Pt nanoparticles. Excluding other promotional mechanisms, the increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption of hydrogen against CO for the preferential oxidation of CO, affording the scaling relationship between Pt 5d band energy and CO/H2 adsorption energy difference. The decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers CO site coverage to promote its association with oxygen for the total oxidation of CO, giving the scaling relationship between Pt 5d occupancy and activation energy. The above insights outline a molecular&#8208;level understanding of CO poisoning.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Tuning Induced d&#8208;Band Center Modulation on Co&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides coupled with N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. The cation&#8208;tuning induced ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh corner&#8208;sharing effect enables the modulation and optimization of the electronic structure of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides, resulting in the superior electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Atomic substitutions at the tetrahedral site (ATd) could theoretically achieve an efficient optimization of the charge at the octahedral site (BOh) through the ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh interactions in the spinel oxides (AB2O4). Despite substantial progress having been made, the precise control and adjustment of the spinel oxides are still challenging owing to the complexity of their crystal structure. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent method to tailor the structures of spinel oxides and use the spinel oxide composites (ACo2O4/NCNTs, A=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for oxygen electrocatalysis. The optimized MnCo2O4/NCNTs exhibit high activity and excellent durability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Remarkably, the rechargeable liquid Zn&#8211;air battery equipped with a MnCo2O4/NCNTs cathode affords a specific capacity of 827&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1 with a high power density of 74.63&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and no voltage degradation after 300 cycles at a high charging&#8211;discharging rate (5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the substitution could regulate the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby lead to the modulation of the electronic structure accompanied with the movement of the d&#8208;band center. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites interact through the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;Co, and the Co3+Oh of MnCo2O4 with the optimal charge structure allows a more suitable binding interaction between the active center and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Alkynyl Sulfonium Salts Can Be Employed as Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts and Generate Alkynyl Radicals under Blue&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>

Alkynyl sulfonium salts were employed as chalcogen bonding (ChB) catalysts for the first time. They display superior capability in the generation of alkynyl radicals under blue&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) has emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis. However, compared with the well&#8208;developed selenium&#8208; and tellurium&#8208;based salt catalysts, the ChB catalysis of sulfonium salts is still unknown. Here, we report a new type of alkynyl&#8208;sulfonium salt ChB catalysis for various ionic transformations, including transfer hydrogenation, bromination, bromolactonization, dimerization of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction and Ritter reaction. More importantly, the photocapability of ChB was first demonstrated to generate alkynyl radicals for the synthesis of a variety of chalcogenoacetylenes. Mechanistic studies shed light on the mechanism of the photoinduced reactions and confirmed the involvement of alkynyl radicals which are difficult to generate otherwise.

         <title>Topochemical Synthesis of a Heterochiral Peptide Polymer in Different Polymorphic Forms from Crystals and Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering polymers in different packing modes is an ideal method to get different properties from a polymer, but a challenging task. In this study, two polymorphs of a heterochiral dipeptide yielded pseudopolypeptides in parallel and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangements upon topochemical polymerization (see picture). Synthesis of the parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet polymer could be scaled up by using an aerogel.







Abstract
We have designed a heterochiral dipeptide monomer (N3&#8208;D&#8208;Ala&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2C&#8801;CH) modified with an azide group and an alkyne at its termini for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. We obtained two different polymorphs: PI (P21) from a DCM&#8211;toluene mixture, and PII (P&#8208;1) from a hexane&#8211;ethyl acetate mixture. PI adopts parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing, and PII adopts antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing. In both the cases, molecules from adjacent &#946;&#8208;stacks are arranged in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner. On heating, the polymorphs underwent TAAC reaction to form linear polymers having parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like ordering (PI) and an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure (PII). PI reacted spontaneously at room temperature and the crystals showed cracking after the reaction, but PII was intact even after complete reaction. The dipeptide congealed various solvents, and the aerogels were identical to PI. These aerogels also underwent spontaneous TAAC reaction at room temperature to yield a pseudoprotein with alternate D&#8208; and L&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Rapid and Controlled Polymerization of Bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;Caprolactone toward Fully Recyclable Polyesters and Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P&#948;CL that was capable to recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers with excellent mechanical properties can be easily prepared by sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide.







Abstract
The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end&#8208;of&#8208;use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time&#8208;consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide (l&#8208;LA) affords well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.

         <title>Chemical Defect&#8208;Driven Response on Graphene&#8208;Based Chemiresistors for Sub&#8208;ppm Ammonia Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>

Covalent functionalization of graphene leads to excellent sensitivity for ammonia. Quick response and recovery of the functionalized graphene layers are observed, and a sensitivity benchmarking with other graphene chemiresistors shows a superior sensitivity in the sub&#8208;ppm range.







Abstract
Gas sensors are essential in several fields and, in general, features such as high sensitivity, quick response, and fast recovery are required, along with low power consumption and low cost. Graphene is considered a promising material for gas sensing applications, its functionalization often being a requisite. In the present study, we developed competitive and promising gas sensors for ammonia detection. Interestingly, we present an easy and efficient method to functionalize graphene by using diazonium chemistry with different functional groups. Moreover, we prove the superior sensing capability of our covalently modified graphene layers. These experimental data have been consistently interpreted by theoretical calculations, which reveal a defect&#8208;driven sensor's response to ammonia. These results open the possibility of a comprehensive design and use of these graphene&#8208;based sensors in real applications.

         <title>Back Cover: Defect&#8208;Free Alternating Conjugated Polymers Enabled by Room&#8208; Temperature Stille Polymerization (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free alternating conjugated polymers were produced by exploring palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille polymerization at room temperature. The selected copolymers demonstrated no homocoupling defects and superior charge transport properties, thus paving the road for the development of plastic electronics. Details of this study are reported by Qinqin Shi, Hui Huang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202115969).

The enzymatic synthesis of eight luciferin analogues from phenolic derivatives in one&#8208;pot reactions is reported by Pimchai Chaiyen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202116908). Two novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues with methyl substituents were obtained; these compounds emit red and brighter light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. A new detection technology named LUMOS was also developed for in&#8197;situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs), including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos, and fenitrothion, at parts per trillion (ppt) levels without requiring sample pretreatment.

The DNA damage response , which includes DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint pathways in cancer cells, has been considered one of the main impediments to traditional chemotherapy. In their Research Article (e202117075), Na Kong, Xingcai Zhang, Wei Tao, Jong&#8197;Seung Kim, and co&#8208;workers developed a multifunctional construct, M1, to target the DNA damage response of cancer cells. The findings identified a critical role of DNA damage repair pathways during 5&#8208;FU/FUDR therapy and underscore the role of inhibition of these pathways in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.

Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is a type of &#963;&#8208;hole interaction between a Group&#8197;16 chalcogen atom bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and a Lewis base. In their Research Article (e202116071), Xiang&#8208;Yu Chen, Zhi&#8208;Xiang Wang, and co&#8208;workers show that ChB of alkynyl sulfonium salts enables the generation of alkynyl radicals for the synthesis of a variety of chalcogenoacetylenes with diselenides under blue&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Unraveling Charge&#8208;Separation Mechanisms in Photocatalyst Particles by Spatially Resolved Surface Photovoltage Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge separation is key to efficient photocatalytic solar energy conversion. The distribution of surface charge on photocatalysts can be identified and the driving forces of charge separation quantitatively determined at the nanoscale by the spatially resolved surface photovoltage technique. The identification of photocatalytic charge separation mechanisms will enable the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of solar energy offers a potential route to renewable energy, and its efficiency relies on effective charge separation in nanostructured photocatalysts. Understanding the charge&#8208;separation mechanism is key to improving the photocatalytic performance and this has now been enabled by advances in the spatially resolved surface photovoltage (SRSPV) method. In this Review we highlight progress made by SRSPV in mapping charge distributions at the nanoscale and determining the driving forces of charge separation in heterogeneous photocatalyst particles. We discuss how charge separation arising from a built&#8208;in electric field, diffusion, and trapping can be exploited and optimized through photocatalyst design. We also highlight the importance of asymmetric engineering of photocatalysts for effective charge separation. Finally, we provide an outlook on further opportunities that arise from leveraging these insights to guide the rational design of photocatalysts and advance the imaging technique to expand the knowledge of charge separation.

         <title>Synthetic Cells: From Simple Bio&#8208;Inspired Modules to Sophisticated Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>

This Review highlights strategies used to build synthetic cells and organelles from scratch. These cell&#8208;like materials, which mimic the structure and function of natural cells, represent the next generation of biologically inspired smart systems. The discussion begins by describing basic functions and components, such as energy supply and compartmentalization, and evolves into systems with an increasing degree of sophistication.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology is the science of building systems that mimic the structure and function of living cells from scratch. To do this, researchers combine tools from chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry to develop functional and structural building blocks to construct synthetic cell&#8208;like systems. The many strategies and materials that have been developed in recent decades have enabled scientists to engineer synthetic cells and organelles that mimic the essential functions and behaviors of natural cells. Examples include synthetic cells that can synthesize their own ATP using light, maintain metabolic reactions through enzymatic networks, perform gene replication, and even grow and divide. In this Review, we discuss recent developments in the design and construction of synthetic cells and organelles using the bottom&#8208;up approach. Our goal is to present representative synthetic cells of increasing complexity as well as strategies for solving distinct challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

         <title>Identification of a Two&#8208;Coordinate Iron(I)&#8211;Oxalate Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence for iron in its unusual oxidation state +I is found from a study on a series of iron&#8211;oxalate complexes in solution and involving a combination of infrared free liquid matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Exotic oxidation states of the first&#8208;row transition metals have recently attracted much interest. In order to investigate the oxidation states of a series of iron&#8211;oxalate complexes, an aqueous solution of iron(III) nitrate and oxalic acid was studied by infrared free liquid matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization as well as ionspray mass spectrometry. Here, we show that iron is not only detected in its common oxidation states +II and +III, but also in its unusual oxidation state +I, detectable in both positive&#8208;ion and in negative&#8208;ion modes, respectively. Vibrational spectra of the gas phase anionic iron oxalate complexes [FeIII(C2O4)2]&#8722;, [FeII(C2O4)CO2]&#8722;, and [FeI(C2O4)]&#8722; were measured by means of infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and their structures were assigned by comparison to anharmonic vibrational spectra based on second&#8208;order perturbation theory.

         <title>Super&#8208;Robust Xanthine&#8211;Sodium Complexes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mimicking the prebiotic submarine synthesis with a simplified model, i.e. reaction of xanthine and NaCl on Au(111), the necessity and appropriateness of high&#8208;temperature, Na&#8208;rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis is justified, by demonstrating that xanthine can form well&#8208;defined complexes with Na, but only at a temperature &#8805;430&#8197;K, and that the complexes are super&#8208;robust and remain adsorbed on Au(111) at a temperature as high as 720&#8197;K.







Abstract
A widely accepted theory is that life originated from the hydrothermal environment in the primordial ocean. Nevertheless, the low desorption temperature from inorganic substrates and the fragileness of hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobases do not support the required thermal stability in such an environment. Herein, we report the super&#8208;robust complexes of xanthine, one of the precursors for the primitive nucleic acids, with Na. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;defined xanthine&#8211;Na complexes can only form when the temperature is &#8805;430&#8197;K, and the complexes keep adsorbed even at &#8776;720&#8197;K, presenting as the most thermally stable organic polymer ever reported on Au(111). This work not only justifies the necessity of high&#8208;temperature, Na&#8208;rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis but also reveals the robustness of the xanthine&#8211;Na complexes upon the harsh environment. Moreover, the complexes can induce significant electron transfer with the metal as inert as Au and hence lift the Au atoms up.

         <title>Accelerating the Crystallization of Zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 with Polyamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is presented to modulate the rate of zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 nucleation by regulating the evolution and colloidal stability of amorphous precursors using a small concentration of polymer additives, thus improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.







Abstract
Tailoring processes of nucleation and growth to achieve desired material properties is a pervasive challenge in synthetic crystallization. In systems where crystals form via nonclassical pathways, engineering materials often requires the controlled assembly and structural evolution of colloidal precursors. In this study, we examine zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization and show that several polyquaternary amines function as efficient accelerants of nucleation, and, in selected cases, tune crystal size by orders of magnitude. Among the additives tested, polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA) was found to have the most pronounced impact on the kinetics of SSZ&#8208;13 formation, leading to a 4&#8208;fold reduction in crystallization time. Our findings also reveal that enhanced nucleation occurs at an optimal PDDA concentration where a combination of light&#8208;scattering techniques demonstrate these conditions lead to polymer&#8208;induced aggregation of amorphous precursors and the promotion of (alumino)silicate precipitation from the growth solution. Here, we show that relatively low concentrations of polymer additives can be used in unique ways to dramatically enhance SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization rates, thereby improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A facile strategy is presented to modulate the rate of zeolite SSZ-13 nucleation by regulating the evolution and colloidal stability of amorphous precursors using a small concentration of polymer additives, thus improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailoring processes of nucleation and growth to achieve desired material properties is a pervasive challenge in synthetic crystallization. In systems where crystals form via nonclassical pathways, engineering materials often requires the controlled assembly and structural evolution of colloidal precursors. In this study, we examine zeolite SSZ-13 crystallization and show that several polyquaternary amines function as efficient accelerants of nucleation, and, in selected cases, tune crystal size by orders of magnitude. Among the additives tested, polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA) was found to have the most pronounced impact on the kinetics of SSZ-13 formation, leading to a 4-fold reduction in crystallization time. Our findings also reveal that enhanced nucleation occurs at an optimal PDDA concentration where a combination of light-scattering techniques demonstrate these conditions lead to polymer-induced aggregation of amorphous precursors and the promotion of (alumino)silicate precipitation from the growth solution. Here, we show that relatively low concentrations of polymer additives can be used in unique ways to dramatically enhance SSZ-13 crystallization rates, thereby improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A highly efficient atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bipyrroles bearing an N&#8722;N linkage from simple hydrazine and 1,4&#8208;diones is presented. Further product derivatizations led to axially chiral bifunctional compounds with high potential in asymmetric catalysis. For this chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed double Paal&#8211;Knorr reaction, an intriguing Fe(OTf)3&#8208;induced enantiodivergence was also observed.

         <title>Static Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images Reveal the Mechanism of Supramolecular Polymerization of an Oligopyridine on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To be or not to be: The pressing question of the fundamental mechanism of two&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly processes, namely that of thermodynamic or kinetic control, is demonstrated using the example of a donor&#8211;acceptor oligopyridine on graphite. A statistical analysis of STM images and DFT calculations suggest that there is a significant contribution of kinetics similar to copolymerization in bulk.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of a donor&#8211;acceptor bisterpyridine (BTP) equipped with an electron&#8208;rich carbazole unit is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)|solution interface. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional crystals of supramolecular (co)polymers are formed by chain growth polymerization, which in turn can be described by copolymerization statistics. From concentration&#8208;dependent measurements, derived copolymerization parameters and DFT calculations, a mechanism for self&#8208;assembly is developed that suggests a kinetically driven polymerization process in combination with thermodynamically controlled crystallization.

         <title>Hierarchical Assembly of Coordination Macromolecules with Atypical Geometries: Gd44Co28 Crown and Gd95Co60 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a library containing multiple low&#8208;nuclearity units that have compatible geometry but incompatible symmetry, rare Ln&#8722;Co giant clusters with atypical geometry and assembly levels were achieved.







Abstract
The discovered giant clusters are always highly symmetric owing to the spontaneous assembly of one or two basic units. Herein we report the Gd44Co28 crown and Gd95Co60 cage, formulated as [Gd44Co28(IDA)20 (OH)72(CO3)12(OAc)28(H2O)64]&#8901;(ClO4)24 and [Na4Gd95 Co60(IDA)40(OH)150(CO3)40(OAc)58(H2O)164]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(ClO4)41 (H2IDA=iminodiacetic acid), respectively, by providing a library containing multiple low&#8208;nuclearity units. The heart&#8208;like units and crown&#8208;like tetramer found in both compounds indicate unprecedented assembly levels, leading to an atypical geometry characteristic compared to the giant clusters directly assembled by regular units. These two clusters not only significantly increase the size of Ln&#8722;Co clusters but also exhibit the enhanced magnetic entropy change at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. This work provided an effective way to fabricate cluster compounds with giant size and geometry complexity simultaneously.

         <title>Oriented Nanoarchitectonics of Bacteriorhodopsin for Enhancing ATP Generation in a FoF1&#8208;ATPase&#8208;Based Assembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coassembly of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and ATP synthase into an artificial biomimetic system has enabled a cascade reaction under illumination and the synthesis of ATP. The approach based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer electrostatic adsorption results in BR maintaining a highly uniform orientation with a high loading capacity and enhanced phosphorylation. The introduction of optically matched quantum dots led to the ATP production being further enhanced to 2.11 times.







Abstract
Energy conversion plays an important role in the metabolism of photosynthetic organisms. Improving energy transformation by promoting a proton gradient has been a great challenge for a long time. In the present study, we realize a directional proton migration through the construction of oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) microcapsules coated by FoF1&#8208;ATPase molecular motors through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) assembly. The changes in the conformation of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in a radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, optically matched quantum dots were introduced into the artificial coassembly system of BR and FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the use of light energy.

&lt;p&gt;Coassembly of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and ATP synthase into an artificial biomimetic system has enabled a cascade reaction under illumination and the synthesis of ATP. The approach based on layer-by-layer electrostatic adsorption results in BR maintaining a highly uniform orientation with a high loading capacity and enhanced phosphorylation. The introduction of optically matched quantum dots led to the ATP production being further enhanced to 2.11 times.

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Azacorannulenophane Enabled by Strain&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane, an [n]cyclophane molecule bearing the largest polycyclic heteroarene, was synthesized via a strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. The obtained azacorannulenophane shows unique structural and physical features, which provides important insights into the influence of &#960;&#8208;extension and strain from an aliphatic chain in polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
The first example of a cyclophane bearing a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl was synthesized via sequential 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The key to the successful synthesis is the strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of a polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide to the K&#8208;region of [7](2,7)pyrenophane. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane exhibits intriguing structural and physical properties, including unique variation of bowl depth, extraordinarily high&#8208;field chemical shifts in its 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum, a decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and a red shift in the absorption/emission spectrum, when compared to those of the parent azacorannulene. These characteristics are derived from both the &#960;&#8208;extension to the polycyclic aromatic system in the cyclophane structure and the increased curvature enforced by the seven&#8208;carbon aliphatic chain.

         <title>Regulating the Tip Effect on Single&#8208;Atom and Cluster Catalysts: Forming Reversible Oxygen Species with High Efficiency in Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tip effect (TE) has not been mentioned enough in catalysts designing, having a large space to explore. Based on the model of oxidized sub&#8208;nano clusters, the TE was regulated and found to be efficient in designing catalysts, making TiC perform a high activity during the chlor&#8208;alkali industry. This cluster system exhibits great potential in applying in the practical production and the comprehension of the TE is also pushed to a higher level.







Abstract
Chlorine evolution reaction has been applied in the production since a century ago. After times of evolution, it has been widely realized by the electrocatalytic process on anode nowadays. However, the anode applied in production contains a large amount of precious metal, increasing the cost. It is thus an opportunity to apply sub&#8208;nano catalysts in this field. By regulating the tip effect (TE) of the catalyst, it was discovered that the oxidized sub&#8208;nano iridium clusters supported by titanium carbide exhibit much higher efficiency than the single&#8208;atom one, which demonstrates the significance of modifying the electronic interaction. Moreover, it exhibits a &#8776;20&#8201;% decrease of the electricity, &#8776;98&#8201;% selectivity towards chlorine evolution reaction, and high durability of over 350&#8197;h. Therefore, this cluster catalyst performs great potential in applying in the practical production and the comprehension of the tip effect on different types of catalysts is also pushed to a higher level.

         <title>Site&#8208;Directed Chemical Modification of Amyloid by Polyoxometalates for Inhibition of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiazolidinethione (TZ) modified Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POMD) derivative (POMD&#8208;TZ) has been synthesized which can covalently modify &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. The inhibitory effect of POMD&#8208;TZ on A&#946; aggregation is much stronger than that of POMD, thus demonstrating the superiority of the chemical post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) method for the modification of traditional A&#946; inhibitors.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of protein can significantly change protein conformation and function. Inspired by the natural PTM, we present a new approach to inhibit amyloid aggregation by chemical PTM modification. Polyoxometalates (POMs) were used as examples of inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) aggregation to illustrate the chemical PTM method. After the POMs were modified with thiazolidinethione (TZ), the resulting POMD&#8208;TZ acted as a chemical PTM agent and could covalently modify A&#946; site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. Multiple biophysical techniques and biochemical assays have been employed to show the superiority of the chemical PTM method compared to traditional A&#946; inhibitors. Since A&#946; oligomers are more cytotoxic, we further functionalized POMD&#8208;TZ with an A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide and a fluorescent probe to obtain an &#8220;A&#946; oligomer sensitive&#8221; probe. The use of PTM agents for the site&#8208;directed chemical modification of proteins provides a new way to regulate amyloid aggregation.

         <title>Potassium Aluminyl Promoted Carbonylation of Ethene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;promoted carbonylation of alkenes is established for d&#8208;block metals, whilst prior work with aluminium has been limited by reversible C=C coordination and decomposition of CO insertion products. This work shows how the aluminyl anion allows the non&#8208;reversible carbonylation of ethene using carbon monoxide under mild conditions. A bimetallic pathway involving an intramolecular 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift was identified and supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The potassium aluminyl [K{Al(NONDipp)}]2 ([NONDipp]2&#8722;=[O{SiMe2NDipp}2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) activates ethene towards carbonylation with CO under mild conditions. An isolated bis&#8208;aluminacyclopropane compound reacted with CO via carbonylation of an Al&#8722;C bond, followed by an intramolecular hydrogen shift to form K2[Al(NONDipp)(&#956;&#8208;CH2CH=CO&#8208;1&#954;2C1,3&#8208;2&#954;O)Al(NONDipp)Et]. Restricting the chemistry to a mono&#8208;aluminium system allowed isolation of [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH2CO&#8208;&#954;2C1,3)]&#8722;, which undergoes thermal isomerisation to form the [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH=CHO&#8208;&#954;2C,O)]&#8722; anion. DFT calculations highlight the stabilising influence of incorporated benzene at multiple steps in the reaction pathways.

         <title>Wrinkled Titanium Carbide (MXene) with Surface Charge Polarizations through Chemical Etching for Superior Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superb shielding effectiveness (107&#8197;dB at a thickness of 20&#8197;&#956;m) has been achieved in wrinkled MXene films. Such an enhancement is ascribed to the introduction of the absorption of electromagnetic waves by electric dipoles which is induced by the asymmetric distribution of charge density near Ti vacancies. These results offer a promising approach to regulate the electromagnetic interference shielding performance of two&#8208;dimensional materials.







Abstract
Despite the fact that the high conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional laminated transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) contributes to the outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding by the reflection of electromagnetic waves (EWs), it is difficulty to improve EMI shielding by pursuing higher conductivity due to the limitation of intrinsic properties. Here, we achieve superior EMI shielding by introducing the absorption of EWs in MXenes with micro&#8208;sized wrinkles which are induced by abundant Ti vacancies under chemical etching. The shielding effectiveness is up to 107&#8197;dB at a thickness of 20&#8197;&#956;m. Combining with atomic&#8208;scale structure observation and the first&#8208;principles calculations, it is concluded that the promotion of EMI shielding originates from the resonant absorption of formed electric dipoles induced by the asymmetrical distribution of charge densities near Ti vacancies. Our results could open a new vista for developing two&#8208;dimensional EMI shielding materials.

         <title>Single Cell Imaging of Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Driven Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system for photodynamic therapy driven by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is reported. The ECL generated by the Ru(bpy)32+/TPA pair acts as both the optical readout for the monitoring of the dynamic cellular processes and the light source for the excitation of a photosensitizer to produce cytotoxic ROS.







Abstract
We report a photodynamic therapy driven by electrochemiluminescence (ECL). The luminescence generated by Ru(bpy)32+ and co&#8208;reactant tripropylamine (TPA) pair acts as both optical readout for ECL imaging, and light source for the excitation of photosensitizer to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) system. The ECL&#8208;driven PDT (ECL&#8208;PDT) relies on the effective energy transfer from ECL emission to photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which sensitizes the surrounding O2 into ROS. The dynamic process of gradual morphological changes, the variation of cell&#8208;matrix adhesions, as well as the increase of cell membrane permeability in the process of ECL&#8208;PDT were monitored under ECL microscopy (ECLM) with good spatiotemporal resolution. Combining real&#8208;time imaging with ECL&#8208;PDT, this new strategy provides not only new insights into dynamic cellular processes, but also promising potential of ECL in clinical applications.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Exposure of the Intrinsic Magnetic Surface of BaTiO3 to Give Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimensional defect structure of BaTiO3 with exposed intrinsic face of (1
0) has been prepared using supercritical CO2. It displays room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism as demonstrated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Preparation of low&#8208;dimensional ferromagnetic nanomaterials and investigation of their magnetic origin is critical to the exploration of novel materials with various applications such as data storage. Herein, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) BaTiO3 was successfully stripped to a low&#8208;dimensional structure by treating the materials with supercritical CO2 (SC CO2). Under different CO2 pressures, SC CO2 selectively cleaves the covalent bonds of the bulk BaTiO3, leading to the exposure of various surfaces. After SC CO2 treatments, the BaTiO3 exhibits room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism, which is significantly stronger than conventional treatments. According to the experimental and theoretical investigations, the enhanced ferromagnetic property is attributed to the exposure of the intrinsic surfaces of BaTiO3.

         <dc:description>
A synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxyacutuminine is reported. The strategy features an intramolecular, photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition to build the propellane core followed by a retro&#8208;aldol/Dieckmann sequence to form the requisite spirocyclic cyclopentenone.







Abstract
An enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxyacutuminine is reported. Central to our strategy is a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition that forges two of the quaternary stereocenters present in the acutumine alkaloids. A subsequent retro&#8208;aldol/Dieckmann sequence furnishes the spirocyclic cyclopentenone. Efforts to chlorinate the acutumine scaffold at C10 under heterolytic or radical deoxychlorination conditions led to the synthesis of an unexpected cyclopropane&#8208;containing pentacycle.

         <title>Exploring Unconventional SAM Analogues To Build Cell&#8208;Potent Bisubstrate Inhibitors for Nicotinamide N&#8208;Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first cell&#8208;potent and selective nicotinamide N&#8208;methyltransferase (NNMT) bisubstrate inhibitor, II399, was discovered by structure&#8208;based optimization by introducing unconventional S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) mimics. The inhibition mechanism studies and crystal structure of the NNMT&#8211;II399 complex confirm its engagement with both SAM and substrate binding sites. II399 potently inhibits the methyltransferase activity of NNMT in cells.







Abstract
Nicotinamide N&#8208;methyltransferase (NNMT) methylates nicotinamide and has been associated with various diseases. Herein, we report the first cell&#8208;potent NNMT bisubstrate inhibitor II399, demonstrating a Ki of 5.9&#8197;nM in a biochemical assay and a cellular IC50 value of 1.9&#8197;&#956;M. The inhibition mechanism and cocrystal structure confirmed II399 engages both the substrate and cofactor binding pockets. Computational modeling and binding data reveal a balancing act between enthalpic and entropic components that lead to II399&#8242;s low nM binding affinity. Notably, II399 is 1&#8201;000&#8208;fold more selective for NNMT than closely related methyltransferases. We expect that II399 would serve as a valuable probe to elucidate NNMT biology. Furthermore, this strategy provides the first case of introducing unconventional SAM mimics, which can be adopted to develop cell&#8208;potent inhibitors for other SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases.

&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.9&#8197;nM in a biochemical assay and a cellular IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1.9&#8197;&#956;M. The inhibition mechanism and cocrystal structure confirmed &lt;b&gt;II399&lt;/b&gt; engages both the substrate and cofactor binding pockets. Computational modeling and binding data reveal a balancing act between enthalpic and entropic components that lead to &lt;b&gt;II399&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;s low nM binding affinity. Notably, &lt;b&gt;II399&lt;/b&gt; is 1&#8201;000-fold more selective for NNMT than closely related methyltransferases. We expect that &lt;b&gt;II399&lt;/b&gt; would serve as a valuable probe to elucidate NNMT biology. Furthermore, this strategy provides the first case of introducing unconventional SAM mimics, which can be adopted to develop cell-potent inhibitors for other SAM-dependent methyltransferases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Electronic Origin of Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxygenic Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 16, April 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differential protein electrostatics enable excitation of the Photosystem&#8208;II reaction center chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pigment pairs by far&#8208;red light along two distinct, conformation&#8208; and wavelength&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transfer pathways.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II uses sunlight to trigger charge separation and catalyze water oxidation. Intrinsic properties of chlorophyll a pigments define a natural &#8220;red limit&#8221; of photosynthesis at &#8776;680&#8197;nm. Nevertheless, charge separation can be triggered with far&#8208;red photons up to 800&#8197;nm, without altering the nature of light&#8208;harvesting pigments. Here we identify the electronic origin of this remarkable phenomenon using quantum chemical and multiscale simulations on a native Photosystem&#8208;II model. We find that the reaction center is preorganized for charge separation in the far&#8208;red region by specific chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pairs, potentially bypassing the light&#8208;harvesting apparatus. Charge transfer can occur along two distinct pathways with one and the same pheophytin acceptor (PheoD1). The identity of the donor chlorophyll (ChlD1 or PD1) is wavelength&#8208;dependent and conformational dynamics broaden the sampling of the far&#8208;red region by the two charge&#8208;transfer states. The two pathways rationalize spectroscopic observations and underpin designed extensions of the photosynthetically active radiation limit.

         <title>Reversing A Platinum Micromotor by Introducing Platinum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding and controlling the swimming direction of a synthetic nano&#8208; and micromotor holds fundamental and applied significance. Here, we focus on platinum&#8208;containing Janus colloids that catalytically decomposes H2O2 into O2, an archetypical model of chemical micromotor. We discover that platinum oxides (primarily PtO) is produced on Pt films sputter&#8208;coated in O2 plasma, and PtO reverses the motor possibly by self&#8208;electrophoresis. Using this knowledge, micromotors moving in either direction was fabricated by intentionally introducing or removing PtO. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that a Pt micromotor is powered by Pt alone, and open up new avenues for controlling the swimming directions of a micro&#8208; and nanomachine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>During an investigation into the fate of ruthenium precatalysts used for light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation reactions with formation of Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium catalysts, it was found that the reaction of [(IPr)(&#951;6&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] with H2 under UV&#8208;irradiation affords an anionic dinuclear &#963;&#8208;dihydrogen complex, which is thermally surprisingly robust.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a general strategy for achieving ultra&#8208;pure green emissions by suppressing the shoulder peaks in the emission spectra of conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Through precise synthetic fusion of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fragments with conventional PAH, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, increased molecular rigidity, and reduced vibrational frequency could be simultaneously realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters exhibited ultra&#8208;pure green emissions with dominant peaks at ca. 521 nm, photoluminescence quantum yields that are greater than 99%, a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23 nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.77). The bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a record&#8208;high CIE  y  value of 0.74 and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.5%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieved a BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78) for the first time but also showed superior performance among all green OLED devices, with a current efficiency of 220 cd A  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of (Hetero)Arenes with Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and general intermolecular Cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of styrenes with (hetero)arenes including indoles, thiophene and electron rich arenes has been developed, providing straightforward access to enantioenriched alkyl(hetero)arenes with high enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst&#8208;controlled S  N  2&#8208;like pathway between  in situ  generated organocobalt(IV) species and aromatic nucleophiles. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles, providing a new strategy for asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulation from multi&#8208;physical quantity aspect to steer molecular photophysical property is of great significance in improving sensing performance. Here, an investigation on how physical quantity rooted from molecular structure induce optical behavior change to facilitate an ultrasensitive detection to ethylenediamine (EDA) is performed by varying a set of thiols. The model molecule consisted of a thiol with dual&#8208;carboxyl exhibits the strongest fluorescence ascribed to the electron&#8208;donating ability prompted larger orbital overlapping and oscillator strength. The elevated fluorescence positively corelated to the increased EDA, endowing an ultrasensitive response to nanomolar&#8208;liquid/ppm&#8208;vapor. A gas detector with superior performances fulfills a contactless and real&#8208;time management to EDA. We envisage this electron tuning strategy enabled fluorescence enhancement can offer an in&#8208;depth insight in advancing molecule customized design, further paving the way to widen applicable scenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing the 1,1&#8208;Dehydration of Secondary Alcohols to Carbenes: Pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a Source of Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a source of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAAC) for the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;Cu(I)&#8208;complexes and cyclic thiones when reacted with Cu(I)&#8208;salts and elemental sulfur, respectively, under reductive elimination of water from the carbon(IV)&#8208;center. This result demonstrates a convenient and facile access to CAAC&#8208;based Cu(I)&#8208;salts, which are well known catalysts for different organic transformations. It further establishes secondary alcohols to be a viable source of carbenes &#8211; realizing after 185 years Dumas&#8217; dream who tried to prepare  the  parent carbene (CH  2  ) by 1,1&#8208;dehydration of methanol. Addressed is also the reactivity of water towards CAACs, which proceeds through an oxidative addition of the O&#8208;H bond to the carbon(II)&#8208;center. This emphasizes the ability of carbon&#8208;compounds to mimic the reactivity of transition&#8208;metal complexes: reversible oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the O&#8208;H bond to/from the C(II)/C(IV)&#8208;centre.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen over PdCu/Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates with O  2  under mild conditions remains a great challenge. Here we report a ZSM&#8208;5 (Z&#8208;5) supported PdCu bimetallic catalyst (PdCu/Z&#8208;5) for methane conversion to oxygenates by reacting with O  2  in the presence of H  2  at low temperature (120 &#176;C). Benefiting from the co&#8208;existence of PdO nanoparticles and Cu single atoms via tandem catalysis, the PdCu/Z&#8208;5 catalyst exhibited high oxygenates yield of 1178 mmol/g  Pd  /h (mmol of oxygenates per gram Pd per hour) and at the same time high oxygenates selectivity of up to 95%. Control experiments and mechanistic studies revealed that PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H  2  O  2  from O  2  and H  2  , while Cu single atoms not only accelerated the activation of H  2  O  2  for the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) from H  2  O  2  decomposition, but also enabled the homolytic cleavage of CH  4  by &#183;OH to methyl radicals (&#183;CH  3  ). Subsequently, the &#183;OH reacted quickly with the &#183;CH  3  to form CH  3  OH with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Catalyst&#8211;Solvent Couples from Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of bioinspired supramolecule architectures allowed us to compartmentalize highly charged aqua scandium ions into chiral hydrophobic scaffolds, thereby enabling efficient recyclability of solvent&#8211;catalyst couples. The recycling without significant loss in catalytic performance has been considered a formidable task, especially for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions using basic substrates. This is because Lewis basic impurities derived from starting materials, products, and water are highly competitive ligands for both substrate binding and metal complexation, poisoning the Lewis acids and leading to their leaching. Notwithstanding the use of basic aniline, the optimal architecture allowed for effective suppression of Sc  3+  leaching and for reuse of both water and catalyst without mortiferous deactivation in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of  meso  &#8208;epoxides. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application to asymmetric thia&#8208;Michael addition and asymmetric hydroxymethylation was also demonstrated. The successful recycling in these reactions in highly Lewis basic environments underpin the exceptionally high robustness of the chiral Lewis acid catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Rate Acceleration of Cooperative Catalytic Systems: Metal Nanoparticles and Lewis Acids in Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Employing two distinct catalysts in one reaction medium synergistically is a powerful strategy for activating less reactive substrates. Although the approach has been well&#8208;developed in homogeneous conditions, it remains challenging and rare in heterogeneous catalysis, especially under gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid multiphase reaction conditions. Here, we describe the development of cooperative and synergistic catalyst systems of heterogeneous Rh&#8211;Pt bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, Rh&#8211;Pt/DMPSi&#8211;Al2O3, and Sc(OTf)3 in the liquid phase for the hydrogenation of arenes under very mild conditions. Dramatic rate acceleration was achieved with cooperative activation. Remarkably, more challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents were smoothly hydrogenated. Mechanistic insights into the cooperative activation of an aromatic substrate by heterogeneous metal nanoparticles and a soluble Lewis acid was obtained by kinetic studies and by direct observation of 1H and 45Sc NMR spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Cation&#8208;Ordered Structure Type with Multiple Thermal Redistributions in Co2InSbO6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation ordering in solids is important for controlling physical properties and leads to ilmenite (FeTiO3) and LiNbO3 type derivatives of the corundum structure, with ferroelectricity resulting from breaking of inversion symmetry in the latter. However, a hypothetical third ABO3 derivative with R32 symmetry has never been observed.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cation ordering in solids is important for controlling physical properties and leads to ilmenite (FeTiO3) and LiNbO3 type derivatives of the corundum structure, with ferroelectricity resulting from breaking of inversion symmetry in the latter. However, a hypothetical third ABO3 derivative with R32 symmetry has never been observed. Here we show that Co2InSbO6 recovered from high pressure has a new, ordered-R32 A2BCO6 variant of the corundum structure. Co2InSbO6 is also remarkable for showing two cation redistributions, to (Co0.5In0.5)2 CoSbO6 and then Co2InSbO6 variants of the ordered-LiNbO3 A2BCO6 structure on heating.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;activated, Chemiluminescent Siderophore&#8208;Dioxetane Probes Enable the Selective and Highly Sensitive Detection of Bacterial ESKAPE Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sensitive detection of bacterial infections is a prerequisite for their successful treatment. The use of a chemiluminescent readout was so far hampered by an insufficient probe enrichment at the pathogens. We coupled siderophore moieties, that harness the unique iron transport system of bacteria, with enzyme&#8208;activatable dioxetanes and obtained seven trifunctional probes with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios (S/B = 426&#8208;859). Conjugates with efficient iron transport capability into bacteria were identified through a growth recovery assay. All ESKAPE pathogens were labelled brightly by desferrioxamine conjugates, while catechols were weaker due to self&#8208;quenching. Bacteria could also be detected inside lung epithelial cells. The best probe 8 detected 9.1x103 CFU/ml of S. aureus and 5.0x104 CFU/ml of P. aeruginosa, while the analogous fluorescent probe 10 was 200&#8208;307fold less sensitive. This qualifies siderophore dioxetane probes for the selective and sensitive detection of bacteria.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Poor oxygen diffusion at multiphase interfaces in air cathode suppresses the energy densities of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Developing effective strategies to tackle the issue is of great significance for overcoming the performance bottleneck. Herein, inspired by the bionics of diving flies, a polytetrafluoroethylene layer was coated on the surfaces of Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs) grown on carbon cloth (CC) to create a hydrophobic surface to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion, rendering the hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode a higher limiting current density (214 mA cm&#8210;2 at 0.3 V) than that (10 mA cm&#8210;2) of untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode. Consequently, the assembled ZAB employing hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode acquired a higher power density (171 mW cm&#8210;2) than that (102 mW cm&#8210;2) utilizing untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode, proving the enhanced interfacial reaction kinetics on air cathode benefiting from the hydrophobization engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines by C(sp3)&#8722;H Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available symmetrical 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs) were used as substrates to obtain chiral Hantzsch&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;DHPs, which are frequently contained in pharmaceuticals. The inert C&#8722;H bond was converted into a versatile C&#8722;Br bond, which enabled the modification of the chiral 1,4&#8208;DHP derivatives with high efficiency by nucleophilic substitution. Furthermore, axially chiral 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were accessible by central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion.







Abstract
Described herein is the enantioselective synthesis of Hantzsch&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs), which are frequently contained in pharmaceuticals. Readily available symmetrical 1,4&#8208;DHPs were used as substrates, and the methyl group at the 2&#8208; or 6&#8208;position of the 1,4&#8208;DHP was selectively monobrominated by desymmetrizing enantioselective bromination. The inert C&#8722;H bond was converted into a versatile C&#8722;Br bond, which guaranteed the modification of the chiral 1,4&#8208;DHP derivatives with high efficiency. Furthermore, axially chiral 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were accessible by central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion.

         <title>Identifying Performance Descriptors in CO2 Hydrogenation over Iron&#8208;Based Catalysts Promoted with Alkali Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron carbides (FeCx) presence in Fe&#8208;based catalysts does not secure efficient CO2 hydrogenation to C2+&#8208;hydrocarbons. The efficiency depends on the ability of FeCx to activate CO, CO2 and H2. The kinetics of these processes is affected by perturbation of electronic properties of Fe in FeCx by an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs) promoter. This knowledge can be valued for the design of catalysts for other reactions where such promoters are used.







Abstract
Alkali metal promoters have been widely employed for preparation of heterogeneous catalysts used in many industrially important reactions. However, the fundamentals of their effects are usually difficult to access. Herein, we unravel mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the role of alkali metals in CO2 hydrogenation over Fe&#8208;based catalysts through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques, spatially resolved steady&#8208;state and transient kinetic analyses. The promoters affect electronic properties of iron in iron carbides. These carbide characteristics determine catalyst ability to activate H2, CO and CO2. The Allen scale electronegativity of alkali metal promoter was successfully correlated with the rates of CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons and CH4 as well as with the rate constants of individual steps of CO or CO2 activation. The derived knowledge can be valuable for designing and preparing catalysts applied in other reactions where such promoters are also used.

         <title>Dinitrogen Coordination to a High&#8208;Spin Diiron(I/II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen coordination to multiiron complexes is instrumental in understanding the reactivity of nitrogenases cofactors. The synthesis of a high&#8208;spin mixed&#8208;valent cis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;dinitrogen)diiron(I/II) complex obtained by a one&#8208;electron reduction of a diiron(II/II) precursor is reported. The electronic structure of the complex was studied using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and DFT calculations, which support a S=7/2 ground state.







Abstract
Dinitrogen coordination to iron centers underpins industrial and biological fixation in the Haber&#8211;Bosch process and by the FeM cofactors in the nitrogenase enzymes. The latter employ local high&#8208;spin metal centers; however, iron&#8211;dinitrogen coordination chemistry remains dominated by low&#8208;valent states, contrasting the enzyme systems. Here, we report a high&#8208;spin mixed&#8208;valent cis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;dinitrogen)diiron(I/II) complex [(FeBr)2(&#956;&#8208;N2)Lbis]&#8722; (2), where [Lbis]&#8722; is a bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane. Field&#8208;applied M&#246;ssbauer spectra, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, and computational methods support a delocalized S=7/2 Fe2N2 unit with D=&#8722;5.23&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and consequent slow magnetic relaxation.

&lt;p&gt;Dinitrogen coordination to iron centers underpins industrial and biological fixation in the Haber&#8211;Bosch process and by the FeM cofactors in the nitrogenase enzymes. The latter employ local high-spin metal centers; however, iron&#8211;dinitrogen coordination chemistry remains dominated by low-valent states, contrasting the enzyme systems. Here, we report a high-spin mixed-valent &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-dinitrogen)diiron(I/II) complex [(FeBr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), where [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is a bis(&#946;-diketiminate) cyclophane. Field-applied M&#246;ssbauer spectra, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, and computational methods support a delocalized &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;=&#8722;5.23&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and consequent slow magnetic relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges, Prospects, and Emerging Applications of Inkjet&#8208;Printed Electronics: A Chemist's Point of View</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on the field at the junction of inkjet printing and high&#8208;tech applications in optoelectronics, energy production and storage, and (bio)detection. We assess the micro&#8208; and nanostructuring inkjet printing methods and answer the following questions: What are the current, strategies to improve the resolution of printed patterns? To what extent can advances in nanochemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and surface chemistry be integrated into printing strategies?







Abstract
Driven by the development of new functional inks, inkjet&#8208;printed electronics has achieved several milestones upon moving from the integration of simple electronic elements (e.g., temperature and pressure sensors, RFID antennas, etc.) to high&#8208;tech applications (e.g. in optoelectronics, energy storage and harvesting, medical diagnosis). Currently, inkjet printing techniques are limited by spatial resolution higher than several micrometers, which sets a redhibitorythreshold for miniaturization and for many applications that require the controlled organization of constituents at the nanometer scale. In this Review, we present the physico&#8208;chemical concepts and the equipment constraints underpinning the resolution limit of inkjet printing and describe the contributions from molecular, supramolecular, and nanomaterials&#8208;based approaches for their circumvention. Based on these considerations, we propose future trajectories for improving inkjet&#8208;printing resolution that will be driven and supported by breakthroughs coming from chemistry. Please check all text carefully as extensive language polishing was necessary. Title ok? Yes

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Thermal Redox Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with Carbon Electrophiles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under thermal conditions, nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H redox functionalization with carbon electrophiles has been advanced to forge value&#8208;added C(sp3)&#8722;C bonds in good to excellent efficiency. This method emphasizes the use of external Zn as reductant and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide as an oxidant and shows remarkable compatibility with Ni&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;H bond coupling with carbon electrophiles remains rarely explored under thermo&#8208;driven hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) conditions due to the challenge of integrating oxidation and reduction in a single operation. We report here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylation and alkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with organohalides to forge C(sp3)&#8722;C bonds by merging economical Zn and tBuOOtBu (DTBP) as the external reductant and oxidant. The mild and easy&#8208;to&#8208;operate protocol enables facile carbofunctionalization of N&#8208;/O&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and cyclohexane C&#8722;H bonds, and preparation of a few intermediates of bioactive compounds and drug derivatives. Preliminary mechanistic studies implied addition of an alkyl radical to a NiII salt.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks via Asymmetric Organocatalysis for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and general organocatalytic asymmetric polymerization approach for the chiral covalent organic framework (CCOF) synthesis under ambient conditions is presented. The metalated CCOF can be further shaped into a fixed&#8208;bed reactor by incorporation with ecofriendly and low&#8208;cost chitosan to realize the scaled&#8208;up catalytic asymmetric A3&#8208;coupling reaction in a green and facile way.







Abstract
A general and efficient organocatalytic asymmetric polymerization approach for the synthesis of chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) has been developed. With a chiral 2&#8208;methylpyrrolidine catalyst, a series of tris(N&#8208;salicylideneamine)&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs are directly constructed from prochiral aldehyde&#8208; and primary amine&#8208;monomers. The adopted aminocatalytic asymmetric Schiff&#8208;base condensation herein is performed under ambient conditions with clear green synthetic advantages over the conventional acid&#8208;catalysed solvothermal methods. The obtained &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;CCOFs can be further metalated by a solid&#8208;state coordination approach, and the resulting CuII@CCOFs can highly promote an asymmetric A3&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, a CuII@CCOF@chitosan aerogel was fabricated as a highly efficient fixed&#8208;bed model reactor for scaled&#8208;up catalysis. The concept of aminocatalytic asymmetric polymerization might open a new way for constructing the CCOFs via asymmetric organocatalysis.

         <title>Biologically Safe, Versatile, and Smart Bismuthene Functionalized with a Drug Delivery System Based on Red Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bismuthene&#8208;loaded red phosphorus quantum dot (BP QD)&#8208; and DOX&#8208;based drug delivery system was constructed that is biologically safe, versatile, and exhibits smart light&#8208; and pH&#8208; responsiveness. The material showed an extremely high drug loading capacity (ca. 250&#8201;%) and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (ca. 54&#8201;%). The intrinsic photothermal properties of bismuthene and photodynamic effects of RP QDs enhanced the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are attracting attention for cancer therapy. However, high toxicity, insensitivity to external stimuli and single therapeutic modality are still key issues hindering their clinical application. Therefore, the construction of a safe, intelligent and versatile nanocomposite is needed to meet clinical expectations. Herein, we developed a nanocomposite of Bi@RP&#8208;PEG&#8208;DOX with 2D bismuthene loaded with 0D red phosphorus quantum dots and DOX. The nanocomposite with DOX loading capacity (ca. 250&#8201;%) and photothermal conversion efficiency (ca. 54&#8201;%) showed both photothermal and photodynamic effects and a sensitive response of drug release to the acidic tumor microenvironment or NIR II laser irradiation. The nanocomposite exhibits good biosafety. Through the X&#8208;ray attenuation properties of bismuth, the nanocomposite serves as an excellent CT contrast agent, providing potential to perform CT&#8208;guided therapy.

         <title>Soft Alloys Constructed with Distinct Mesoatoms via Self&#8208;Sorting Assembly of Giant Shape Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal alloy superlattices with large volume asymmetry were constructed based on self&#8208;sorting assembly of binary giant shape amphiphiles, as reported by Zebin Su, Stephen Z.&#8197;D. Cheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200637). MgZn2, NaZn13 and CaCu5 superlattices were observed in soft matters, and the thermodynamic origin of their formation was quantitatively analyzed.

&lt;p&gt;Metal alloy superlattices with large volume asymmetry were constructed based on self-sorting assembly of binary giant shape amphiphiles, as reported by Zebin Su, Stephen Z.&#8197;D. Cheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202200637"&gt;10.1002/anie.202200637&lt;/a&gt;). MgZn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NaZn&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and CaCu&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; superlattices were observed in soft matters, and the thermodynamic origin of their formation was quantitatively analyzed.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Caging Enables the Control of Endogenous DNA Alkyltransferase Activity with Light inside Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule ligand&#8208;directed caging strategy enables the localized modulation of endogenous enzyme activity in high temporal precision without genetic engineering, as reported by Yiyun Chen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115472). The small molecule ligands deactivate the endogenous DNA alkyltransferase by caging the enzyme's active site inside live cells. Light irradiation on demand releases the enzyme's active site to restore activity.

         <title>Chirality of Perylene Diimides: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a particularly important concept in nature and exists at all length scales, ranging from the molecular level to the supramolecular level. Over the last two decades, various design strategies have been developed to construct perylene diimide (PDI) based chiral materials and to mimic the chiral assembly process in biological systems, but applications of these chiral aggregates are still at an early stage. This minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and properties of chiral PDIs. Three different approaches can be utilized to generate chirality in PDI based materials: the twisted planes of PDIs, the chiral substituents of PDIs, and the co&#8208;assembly of achiral PDIs and chiral guests. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the applications of chiral PDIs as well as potential future developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Vinylcyclopropanes with Imines for the Synthesis of Chiral Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective and diastereoselective (up to 98% ee and &gt;20:1 dr) (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and  N  &#8208;tosylaldimines has been developed, which allows for facile access to a range of highly functionalized chiral pyrrolidines. Notably, this method makes use of vinylcyclopropanes as a synthon for phosphine&#8208;mediated asymmetric annulation reaction, which will offer new opportunities for potential applications of cyclopropanes substrates in phosphine&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Generation and Accumulation of Triplet Excitons for Efficient Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The traditional method to achieve ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is to hybrid n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* configurations in appropriate proportion, which are contradictory to each other for improving efficiency and lifetime of phosphorescence. In this work, through replacing the electron&#8208;donating aromatic group with a methoxy group and combining intramolecular halogen bond to promote intersystem crossing and suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh) has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers. As compared to CzS2Br, which has a similar substituted position of bromine atom and kisc&#160;(the rate of intersystem crossing), the smaller&#160;&#916;ETT*&#160;(the energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence) in 2Br&#8208;OSPh could accelerate the transition from T1 to T1*. This research indicates that both generation and accumulation of triplet excitons play an important role in realizing efficient UOP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Transamidation of Unactivated Tertiary Amides by Electrophilic N&#8211;C(O) Activation via Amide&#8208;to&#8208;Acyl Iodide Re&#8208;Routing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. Most crucially, the method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, thus reverting the classical order of reactivity of carboxylic acid derivatives. This method provides a direct route to amide&#8208;to&#8208;amide bond interconversion with excellent chemoselectivity using equivalent amounts of amines. The combination of acid and iodide has been identified as the essential factor to activate the amide C&#8211;N bond through electrophilic catalytic activation, enabling the production of new desired transamidated products with wide substrate scope of both unactivated amides and amines, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs (&gt;80 examples). We anticipate that this powerful activation mode of unactivated amide bonds will find broad&#8208;ranging applications in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Metastable Species in Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reveal unique hydrogen (H&#8208;) bonding patterns and exploit them to control the kinetics, pathways and length of supramolecular polymers (SPs). New bisamide&#8208;containing monomers were designed to elucidate the role of competing intra&#8208;  vs  . intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions on supramolecular polymerization (SP). Remarkably, two polymerization&#8208;inactive metastable states were discovered. Contrary to previous examples, the commonly assumed intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded monomer does not evolve into intermolecularly H&#8208;bonded SPs  via  ring opening, but rather forms a metastable dimer. In this dimer, all H&#8208;bonding sites are saturated, either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly, hampering elongation. The dimers exhibit an advantageous preorganization, which upon opening of the intramolecular portion of the H&#8208;bonding motif facilitates SP in a consecutive process. Ultimately, the retardation of spontaneous self&#8208;assembly as a result of two metastable states enables length control in SP by seed&#8208;mediated growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate Using a Phase&#8208;Transitional Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is utilized as one of the most popular consumer plastics worldwide, but difficulties associated with recycling PET have generated a severe environmental crisis with most PET ending its lifecycle in landfills. We report that zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 deconstructs waste PET into the building blocks terephthalic acid (TA) and mono&#8208;methyl terephthalate (MMT) within 24 hours at 260 &#176;C (total yield of 98% under 1 atm H  2  and 81% under 1 atm Ar). Extensive structural characterization studies reveal that during the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 undergoes an intriguing transformation into MIL&#8208;140A, which is another Zr&#8208;MOF that shows good catalytic activity toward PET degradation under similar reaction conditions. These results illustrate the diversity of applications for Zr&#8208;MOFs and establish MOFs as a new class of polymer degradation catalysts with the potential to address long&#8208;standing challenges associated with plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hierarchical (Macro)molecular Assembly Assisted by Donor&#8208;Acceptor Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions Exhibiting Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This communication reveals co&#8208;assembly of an electron&#8208;deficient naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI)&#8208;appended polyurethane (P1) and electron&#8208;rich pyrene (Py), forming an organogel with prominent room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. In a non&#8208;polar medium, intra&#8208;chain hydrogen&#8208;bonding among the urethane groups of P1 produces a folded structure with an array of the NDIs in the periphery, which intercalate Py by charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208;interaction. Such CT&#8208;complexation enables slow crystallization of the peripheral hydrocarbons, causing gelation with nanotubular morphology, in which the wall consists of the alternating NDI&#8208;Py stack. Such D&#8208;A assembly exhibits ferroelectricity (saturation polarization  P  s  ~ 0.8 &#181;C/cm  2  and coercive field  E  c  ~ 8 kV/cm at 500V and 10Hz frequency) with Curie temperature (  T  c  ) of ~ 350 K, which can be related to the disassembly of the CT&#8208;complex. In the absence of Py, P1 forms spherical aggregates, showing dielectric behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Blue Afterglow through Molecular Fusion for Bio&#8208;applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow materials have drawn considerable attention due to their attractive luminescent properties. However, the low&#8208;efficient luminescence in aqueous environment limits their applications in life sciences. Here, we developed a molecular fusion strategy to improve the afterglow efficiency in the photochemical afterglow materials. By fusing a cache unit with an emitter, we obtained a blue afterglow system with a quantum yield up to 2.59%. It was 162 times higher than the traditional physical mixing system and more than an order of magnitude larger than the covalent coupling system. High&#8208;efficient afterglow nanoparticles were obtained and utilized for bio&#8208;imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 131, and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) of &#946;&#8208;hCG with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.34 mIU/mL. This paves a new way for high&#8208;efficiency afterglow materials construction and expands the luminescence reporter candidates for disease diagnosis and bio&#8208;imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Plasmonic Nanodevice for Cascade Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the creation of self&#8208;assembled nanodevices with specific biological functions, one of the fundamental challenges is amplifying initial, faint signals that cannot be detected or transmitted directly. Herein, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, dynamic DNA origami plasmonic nanodevice that converts trace stimuli signals to detectable NIR CD responses.







Abstract
Here, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, origami nanodevice&#8208;based plasmonic system, which performs DNA&#8208;regulated, cascade amplification of faint chemical/biological signals. In this system, two gold&#8208;nanorods (GNRs) are co&#8208;assembled onto a DNA lock&#8208;containing, tweezer&#8208;like DNA origami template. Logic circuits serve as recognition and amplification elements for specific messengers, producing DNA keys for driving conformational changes of the plasmonic nanodevices. In the presence of input signals including nucleic acids, adenosines, chiral tyrosinamides or specific receptors expressed by tumor cells, the plasmonic nanodevices can be activated to perform dynamic structural motions, reporting robust responses via plasmonic circular dichroism (CD) spectral changes. This DNA nanodevice&#8208;based system provides a different design to enrich the strategies for constructing synthetic nanomachines, enabling the customized bottom&#8208;up nanostructure construction for sensitive biological signaling.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Allylation of Unactivated Electron&#8208;Deficient Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of unactivated heterocyclic aromatic compounds is described. The selective deprotonation of benzylic sites is hypothesized to be controlled by the original coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)2. In addition to the pro&#8208;nucleophiles, readily available bromide and chloride electrophiles could be used.







Abstract
Heterocycles are widespread in pharmaceuticals but methods for their transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization remain limited. This report describes a general, mild, and effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of heterocyclic aromatic compounds, including pyridines, pyrazines, pyrimidines, pyridazines, triazines, benzimidazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, as well as 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;indoles. The exquisite selectivity for benzylic sites at the 2&#8208;position is hypothesized to be controlled by coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)2 subverting generally presumed pKa&#8217;s of benzylic protons. Furthermore, the broad range of heterocyclic substrates, the diversity of electrophiles, and excellent functional group compatibility suggest its future application to synthesis of complex molecules and library diversification in drug discovery.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+1) Cycloaddition between Benzocyclobutenones and Styrene&#8208;Type Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual (4+1), instead of a normal (4+2), cycloaddition has been developed between benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type alkenes via the Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation, which provides a distinct one&#8208;carbon ring expansion approach to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a unique one&#8208;carbon ring&#8208;expansion strategy to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones from benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type olefins. The use of a cationic &#8220;ligandless&#8221; rhodium catalyst was the key for both high reactivity and selectivity towards the (4+1) product. Broad functional group tolerance, a good substrate scope, and scalability have been demonstrated. Computation studies reveal that the origin of the (4+1) selectivity is due to a facile &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway that reduces the overall barrier of the turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8722;C reductive elimination step.

         <title>Photoaffinity Capture Compounds to Profile the Magic Spot Nucleotide Interactomes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular fishing: A family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds enables the identification of putative Magic Spot Nucleotide receptors by a chemoproteomics approach. The resulting datasets cover several bacterial species, correlate with distinct nucleotide phosphorylation patterns and represent high&#8208;value starting points for future investigations into the complex stringent response mechanism.







Abstract
Magic Spot Nucleotides (MSN) regulate the stringent response, a highly conserved bacterial stress adaptation mechanism, enabling survival under adverse external challenges. In times of antibiotic crisis, a detailed understanding of stringent response is essential, as potentially new targets for pharmacological intervention could be identified. In this study, we delineate the MSN interactome in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium applying a family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds. We introduce MSN probes covering a diverse phosphorylation pattern, such as pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp. Our chemical proteomics approach provides datasets of putative MSN receptors both from cytosolic and membrane fractions that unveil new MSN targets. We find that the activity of the non&#8208;Nudix hydrolase ApaH is potently inhibited by pppGpp, which itself is converted to pGpp by ApaH. The capture compounds described herein will be useful to identify MSN interactomes across bacterial species.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles through Asymmetric Electrophilic Aromatic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles has been developed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide array of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles bearing ansa chains with varied length (12&#8208;member to 19&#8208;member) and various functional groups were generated using this method with high to excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient approach for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles (paracyclophanes) has been disclosed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide range of chiral macrocycles bearing varied ring sizes (16 to 23&#8208;membered) and functional group&#8208;containing ansa chains were readily afforded using this method, with excellent yields and high enantioselectivities (23 examples, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er). Experimental studies and DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism and origin of stereoselectivities of these reactions. Preliminary utilization of the planar&#8208;chiral macrocycle as chiral organocatalyst showcased the potential applications of these novel chiral skeletons.

         <title>Glutathione Depletion&#8208;Induced Activation of Dimersomes for Potentiating the Ferroptosis and Immunotherapy of &#8220;Cold&#8221; Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicles based on cinnamaldehyde dimers (CDC dimersomes) were prepared to enhance the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. The dimersomes depleted intracellular glutathione (GSH) by in&#8197;situ Michael addition and underwent breakage during GSH depletion, which promoted the release of the drug contained inside the vesicle and switching &#8220;ON&#8221; of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes.







Abstract
The abundant glutathione (GSH) in &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors weakens ferroptosis therapy and the immune response. Inspired by lipids, we fabricated cinnamaldehyde dimers (CDC) into lipid&#8208;like materials to form dimersomes capable of depleting GSH and delivering therapeutics to potentiate the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of breast cancer. The dimersomes exhibited superior storage stability for over one year. After reaching the tumor, they quickly underwent breakage in the cytosol owing to the conjugation of hydrophilic GSH on CDC by Michael addition, which not only triggered the drug release and fluorescence switch &#8220;ON&#8221;, but also led to the depletion of intracellular GSH. Ferroptosis was significantly enhanced after combination with sorafenib (SRF) and elicited a robust immune response in&#8197;vivo by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and the priming of CD8+ T cells. As a result, the CDC@SRF dimersomes cured breast cancer in all the mice after four doses of administration.

         <title>A Hybrid Halide Perovskite Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MLAPbBr4 (MLA=melamine) features a layered perovskite structure consisting of highly distorted PbBr6 octahedra and planar MLA+ cations. As a result, it exhibits large birefringence up to 0.322@550&#8197;nm. This birefringence makes MLAPbBr4 capable of easily dividing incident light into two polarized rays (e&#8208;ray and o&#8208;ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals that can modulate the polarization of light play a significant role in modern optical devices including polarizing microscopes, optical isolators, and achromatic quarter&#8208;wave plates. To date, commercial birefringent crystals are exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds. Here we report a new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide, MLAPbBr4 (MLA=melamine), which features a (110)&#8208;oriented layered perovskite structure. Although the 6s2 lone&#8208;pair electrons of Pb2+ cations are stereochemically inert, MLAPbBr4 exhibits a birefringence of 0.322@550&#8197;nm, which exceeds those of all commercial birefringent crystals. The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this birefringence should be ascribed to the highly dislocated &#960;&#8208;conjugation of MLA cations and high distortion of PbBr6 octahedra. This work highlights the persistently neglected great potential of hybrid halide perovskites as birefringent crystals.

         <title>Inhibition of Alkali Metal Reduction of 1&#8208;Adamantanol by London Dispersion Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion (LD) effects limit the reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol, despite the use of excess alkali metals Li, Na and K. An unusual sodium complex featuring the adamantoxide and two datively&#8208;coordinated 1&#8208;adamantanol molecules was isolated. This structure showed that the adamantyl moieties cluster together on one&#8208;side of the NaO3 plane, and featured many intramolecular close contacts, as a result of the LD&#8208;effects present.







Abstract
A series of alkali metal 1&#8208;adamantoxide (OAd1) complexes of formula [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2], where M=Li, Na or K, were synthesised by reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol with excess of the alkali metal. The syntheses indicated that only one out of every three HOAd1 molecules was reduced. An X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the sodium derivative shows that the complex features two unreduced HOAd1 donors as well as the reduced alkoxide (OAd1), with the Ad1 fragments clustered together on the same side of the NaO3 plane, contrary to steric considerations. This is the first example of an alkali metal reduction of an alcohol that is inhibited from completion due to the formation of the [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2] complexes, stabilized by London dispersion effects. NMR spectroscopic studies revealed similar structures for the lithium and potassium derivatives. Computational analyses indicate that decisive London dispersion effects in the molecular structure are a consequence of the many C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions between the OAd1 groups.

         <title>Spontaneous Orthogonal Protein Crosslinking via a Genetically Encoded 2&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazole</title>

A genetically encoded N2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;lysine (CATK) permits a spontaneous, quantitative, site&#8208;specific inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with a proximal Tyr in a small antibody&#8208;mimetic protein, generating a novel protein topology accompanied by improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic resistance.







Abstract
Here we report the design of N2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;lysines (CATKs) and their site&#8208;specific incorporation into proteins via genetic code expansion. When introduced into the protein dimer interface, CATKs permitted spontaneous, proximity&#8208;driven, site&#8208;selective crosslinking to generate covalent protein dimers in living cells, with phenyl&#8208;bearing CATK&#8208;1 exhibiting high reactivity toward the proximal Lys and Tyr. Furthermore, when introduced into the N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;strand of either a single&#8208;chain VHH antibody or a supercharged monobody, CATK&#8208;1 enabled site&#8208;specific, inter&#8208;strand, orthogonal crosslinking with a proximal Tyr located on the opposing &#946;&#8208;strand. Compared with a non&#8208;crosslinked monobody, the orthogonally crosslinked monobody displayed improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic stability against an endosomal enzyme. The robust crosslinking reactivity of CATKs should facilitate the design of novel protein topologies with improved physicochemical properties.

         <title>Steric Modulation of Spiro Structure for Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating a three&#8208;dimensional spiro unit into multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, the device efficiency is increased to nearly 1.5&#8197;times that of the unhindered emitter. Notably, the linkage pattern with spatial interaction and hindrance can maintain the narrow FWHM and curb unfavorable redshifts at a high doping ratio.







Abstract
A multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecule with a fused, planar architecture tends to aggregate at high doping ratios, resulting in broad full width at half maximum (FWHM), redshifting electroluminescence peaks, and low device efficiency. Herein, we propose a mono&#8208;substituted design strategy by introducing spiro&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;bifluorene (SBF) units with different substituted sites into the MR&#8208;TADF system for the first time. As a classic steric group, SBF can hinder interchromophore interactions, leading to high device efficiency (32.2&#8211;35.9&#8201;%) and narrow&#8208;band emission (&#8776;27&#8197;nm). Particularly, the shield&#8208;like molecule, SF1BN, seldom exhibits a broadened FWHM as the doping ratio rises, which differs from the C3&#8208;substituted isomer and unhindered parent emitter. These results manifest an effective method for constructing highly efficient MR&#8208;TADF emitters through a spiro strategy and elucidate the feasibility for steric modulation of the spiro structure in &#960;&#8208;framework.

         <title>Investigation of Carboxylic Acid Isosteres and Prodrugs for Inhibition of the Human SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase Enzyme**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SAR study of mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors of the sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) hydrolase, containing isosteres of an essential carboxylic acid moiety, furnished heterocycles with excellent potency and slow, tight&#8208;binding kinetics against the enzyme. Evaluation of selected compounds in cells revealed that transient masking of the heterocycle provided improved inhibitors with a high level of target engagement in cultured cells.







Abstract
Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) is a protein lysine deacylase enzyme that regulates diverse biology by hydrolyzing &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyacyllysine posttranslational modifications in the cell. Inhibition of SIRT5 has been linked to potential treatment of several cancers but potent compounds with activity in cells have been lacking. Here we developed mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors that incorporate isosteres of a carboxylic acid residue that is important for high&#8208;affinity binding to the enzyme active site. By masking of the tetrazole moiety of the most potent candidate from our initial SAR study, we achieved potent and cytoselective growth inhibition for the treatment of SIRT5&#8208;dependent leukemic cancer cell lines in culture. Thus, we provide an efficient, cellularly active small molecule that targets SIRT5, which can help elucidate its function and potential as a future drug target. This work shows that masked isosteres of carboxylic acids are viable chemical motifs for the development of inhibitors that target mitochondrial enzymes, which may have applications beyond the sirtuin field.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;(carbone) Pincer Ligand and Its Coordinative Behavior toward Multi&#8208;Metallic Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer ligand was prepared and its structural characterization reported. With a total of five electron pairs available, this new pincer framework was studied for its coordinative behavior, enabling the formation of trinuclear heterometallic complexes.







Abstract
Carbones are divalent carbon(0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This bis&#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8722;Pd&#8722;Au, Au&#8722;Ni&#8722;Au, and Cu&#8722;Ni&#8722;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8211;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the bis&#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.

         <title>Sustainable Thioetherification via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photoactivation Using Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex thioetherification was developed using simple organic compounds (thianthrenium salts and thiols) and visible&#8208;light irradiation under open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions. This protocol allows the retention of the C&#8722;X bond, as well as the late&#8208;stage thioetherification of biomolecules.







Abstract
The synthesis of sulfides has been widely studied because this functional subunit is prevalent in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals, as well as being a useful synthetic platform for further elaboration. Thus, various methods to build C&#8722;S bonds have been developed, but typically they require the use of precious metals or harsh conditions. Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategies have emerged as versatile and sustainable ways to achieve C&#8722;S bond formation, avoiding challenges associated with previous methods. This work describes an open&#8208;to&#8208;air, photoinduced, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thioetherification from readily available reagents via EDA complex formation that tolerates a wide range of different functional groups. Moreover, C(sp2)&#8722;halogen bonds remain intact using this protocol, allowing late&#8208;stage installation of the sulfide motif in various bioactive scaffolds, while allowing yet further modification through more traditional C&#8722;X bond cleavage protocols. Additionally, various mechanistic investigations support the envisioned EDA complex scenario.

         <title>Strong Circularly&#8208;polarized Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence from a Feasibly Separable Scaffold of Bidibenzo[b,d]furan with Locked Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel accessible scaffold featuring circularly&#8208;polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is attractive but challenging. Herein, we reported a new feasibly separable bidibenzo[  b  ,  d  ]furan compound with strong circularly&#8208;polarized RTP when doping into the rigid polymer matrix. The simple silica&#8208;gel column can separate the absolute chiral R&#8208;isomer with excellent chiroptical properties. The experimental data reveal that the treated films exhibit an RTP efficiency of 14.8%, the largest dissymmetric factor of 0.12, the longest lifetime of 0.56 s under ambient conditions. It is found that reducing the nonradiative decays boosts the intrinsic circularly&#8208;polarized RTP emission. The impressive results indicate that the locked axial chirality skeleton endows the potential of achieving superior circularly&#8208;polarized emission for the small organic optoelectronic molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol was synthesized in 14 steps from a readily available compound. The synthesis features efficient sequential [2+2] cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to assemble the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol has been achieved in 14 steps. An efficient AgSbF6/t&#8208;BuCl&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the alkynone&#8208;tethered enamine was developed to prepare the highly strained cyclobutene. It was used in combination with a subsequent retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to efficiently construct the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.

         <dc:description>Constructing well&#8208;designed catalysts to accelerate OER catalytic activity and alleviate the charge overpotential is prevailing for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. Herein, we report a concept on engineering the e  g  occupancy of Pt with M alloying (M=Au, Ru) to tune the charge overpotentials for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy results coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the highly electronegative Au can capture more e  g  electrons from Pt, leading to less e  g  electrons of Pt in PtAu than that in PtRu. The lower e  g  occupancy of Pt atoms in PtAu alloys entails the upward shift of Pt  d  band, which causes a strong binding strength towards the intermediates (LiO  2  ), thereby decreasing the OER energy barrier. As a consequence, the Li&#8208;O  2  battery with PtAu cathode delivers a low charge overpotential of 0.36 V and superior cycle life of 220 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g  &#8208;1  , which is among the best in the reported noble metal&#8208;based cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polymer Brushes for Protein Capture and Release in Biological Environments**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;responsive polymer brushes are presented that are compatible with electrochemical control. The brushes can be reversibly switched between protein binding and repelling states at fully physiological conditions with respect to salt, pH and buffering capacity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiments are shown for applications such as non&#8208;fouling, patterning and controlled release of proteins in biological environments.







Abstract
Interfaces functionalized with polymers are known for providing excellent resistance towards biomolecular adsorption and for their ability to bind high amounts of protein while preserving their structure. However, making an interface that switches between these two states has proven challenging and concepts to date rely on changes in the physiochemical environment, which is static in biological systems. Here we present the first interface that can be electrically switched between a high&#8208;capacity (&gt;1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2) multilayer protein binding state and a completely non&#8208;fouling state (no detectable adsorption). Switching is possible over multiple cycles without any regeneration. Importantly, switching works even when the interface is in direct contact with biological fluids and a buffered environment. The technology offers many applications such as zero fouling on demand, patterning or separation of proteins as well as controlled release of biologics in a physiological environment, showing high potential for future drug delivery in vivo.

         <title>Revisiting the Bonding Model for Gold(I) Species: The Importance of Pauli Repulsion Revealed in a Gold(I)&#8208;Cyclobutadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AuI&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex for which reduced Pauli repulsion yields an &#951;1 instead of &#951;4&#8208;coordination is presented. This combined experimental and theoretical study motivates a reformulation of the gold(I)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ligand bonding model to include Pauli repulsion as a key element. Further analysis of gold(I)&#8208;alkynes corroborates this conclusion.







Abstract
Understanding the bonding of gold(I) species has been central to the development of gold(I) catalysis. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of the first gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex, accompanied with bonding analysis by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy decomposition analysis methods. Analysis of possible coordination modes for the new species not only confirms established characteristics of gold(I) bonding, but also suggests that Pauli repulsion is a key yet hitherto overlooked element. Additionally, we obtain a new perspective on gold(I)&#8208;bonding by comparison of the gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene to congeners stabilized by p&#8208;, d&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals. Consequently, we refine the gold(I) bonding model, with a delicate interplay of Pauli repulsion and charge transfer as the key driving force for various coordination motifs. Pauli repulsion is similarly determined as a significant interaction in AuI&#8208;alkyne species, corroborating this revised understanding of AuI bonding.

&lt;p&gt;A novel Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-cyclobutadiene complex for which reduced Pauli repulsion yields an &#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; instead of &#951;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination is presented. This combined experimental and theoretical study motivates a reformulation of the gold(I)-&#960;-ligand bonding model to include Pauli repulsion as a key element. Further analysis of gold(I)-alkynes corroborates this conclusion.

         <title>In Vitro Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Verifies the Proposed Biosynthetic Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeGP cofactor is the prosthetic group of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. The in vitro biosynthesis of this cofactor from synthesized precursors using the cell extract of a mutated strain of Methanococcus maripaludis provided evidence for the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor from 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinols, an organic CO donor, and/or CO and other substances. This method paves the way to analyze the biosynthetic machinery of this H2&#8208;activation cofactor.







Abstract
In the FeGP cofactor of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, low&#8208;spin FeII is in complex with two CO ligands and a pyridinol derivative; the latter ligates the iron with a 6&#8208;acylmethyl substituent and the pyridinol nitrogen. A guanylylpyridinol derivative, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (3), is produced by the decomposition of the FeGP cofactor under irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light and is also postulated to be a precursor of FeGP cofactor biosynthesis. HcgC and HcgB catalyze consecutive biosynthesis steps leading to 3. Here, we report an in vitro biosynthesis assay of the FeGP cofactor using the cell extract of the &#916;hcgB&#916;hcgC strain of Methanococcus maripaludis, which does not biosynthesize 3. We chemically synthesized pyridinol precursors 1 and 2, and detected the production of the FeGP cofactor from 1, 2 and 3. These results indicated that 1, 2 and 3 are the precursors of the FeGP cofactor, and the carboxy group of 3 is converted to the acyl ligand.

         <title>Nature of the Active Sites of Copper Zinc Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect between Cu and Zn enabling optimal adsorption of CO is reported. Through high throughput screening for optimal CO adsorption, two types of active sites were identified that effectively facilitated the C&#8722;C coupling, thus boosting the electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2ER) to multi&#8208;carbon chemical feedstocks over Cu&#8208;based catalysts is of considerable attraction but suffers with the ambiguous nature of active sites, which hinder the rational design of catalysts and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This paper describes a large&#8208;scale simulation to obtain realistic CuZn nanoparticle models and the atom&#8208;level structure of active sites for C2+ products on CuZn catalysts in CO2ER, combining neural network based global optimization and density functional theory calculations. Upon analyzing over 2000 surface sites through high throughput tests based on NN potential, two kinds of active sites are identified, balanced Cu&#8722;Zn sites and Zn&#8208;heavy Cu&#8722;Zn sites, both facilitating C&#8722;C coupling, which are verified by subsequent calculational and experimental investigations. This work provides a paradigm for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;based catalysts and may offer a general strategy to identify accurately the atomic structures of active sites in complex catalytic systems.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Silver&#8208;Catalyzed [3+3] Cycloaddition and Kinetic Resolution of Azomethine Imines with Activated Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [3+3] cycloaddition of activated isocyanides with azomethine imines is reported for the first time. Under silver catalysis, a series of bicyclic 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were obtained in high yields with high stereoselectivities. The versatility of this system was further demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and the kinetic resolution of racemic azomethine imines.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;established [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, the catalytic enantioselective [3+n] (n&#8805;3) cycloaddition reaction of activated isocyanides for the preparation of six&#8208;membered or larger ring systems has remained underdeveloped. Herein, we report the first example of highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [3+3] cycloaddition of activated isocyanides with azomethine imines. By employing silver catalysis, a wide range of biologically important bicyclic 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with good to excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, the same catalytic system could be applied to both the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and the kinetic resolution of racemic azomethine imines, further highlighting its versatility and synthetic utility.

         <title>White&#8208;Light Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Chiral Copper(I) Coordination Polymer through Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral CuI coordination polymers (1&#8208;P/M) were produced from achiral precursors by crystallization&#8208;driven symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly. The enantiomers feature unique helical layered structures and tunable dual&#8208;emission photoluminescence, achieving intrinsic &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8208;white emitting with an ultra&#8208;high color rendering index (93.4) and circularly polarized luminescence with a remarkable dissymmetry factor (8&#215;10&#8722;3) simultaneously.







Abstract
Achieving white&#8208;light emission, especially white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a single&#8208;phase material is challenging. Herein, a pair of chiral CuI coordination polymers (1&#8208;M and 1&#8208;P) have been prepared by the asymmetrical assembly of achiral ligands and Cu2I2 clusters. The compounds display dual emission bands and can be used as single&#8208;phase white&#8208;light phosphors, achieving a &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode with an ultra&#8208;high color rendering index (CRI) of 93.4 and an appropriate correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3632&#8197;K. Meanwhile, corresponding CPL signals with maximum dissymmetry factor |glum|=8&#215;10&#8722;3 have been observed. Hence, intrinsic white&#8208;light emission and CPL have been realized simultaneously in coordination polymers for the first time. This work gains insight into the nature of chiral assembly from achiral units and offers a prospect for the development of single&#8208;phase white&#8208;CPL materials.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrothermal Flow&#8208;Enhanced Magneto Biosensor for Highly Sensitive Protein Detection in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast magneto biosensor, which employs AC electrothermally driven flow (ACEF) for accelerated mass transport and enhanced immunocomplex formation, is developed for highly sensitive protein measurement in whole blood samples.







Abstract
Current diagnostic tests for sensitive protein detection rely on immunological techniques, such as ELISA, which require sample purification, multiple washing steps and lengthy incubation, hindering their use for rapid testing. Here, we report a simple electrothermal flow&#8208;enhanced biosensor for ultrafast, high sensitivity measurements of protein biomarkers in whole blood. Magnetic nanobeads dually&#8208;labeled with a detection antibody and enzyme reporter are used to form immunocomplexes with the target protein, which are readily transported to the sensor via magnetic concentration. The incorporation of electrothermal flows enhances immunocomplex formation, allowing for rapid and sensitive detection without requiring blood purification or lengthy incubation. Proof of concept was carried out using Plasmodium falciparum histidine&#8208;rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria parasite biomarker, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 5.7&#8197;pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (95&#8197;fM) in whole blood in 7&#8197;min. The speed, sensitivity and simplicity of this device make it attractive for rapid diagnostic testing.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activatable Spherical Nucleic Acids for Conditional Control of Protein Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light activatable spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) were designed to achieve programmable optical control of protein activity. The SNAs remain inert and can be remotely activated by NIR irradiation to function as an enzyme inhibitor, while addition of antidote DNA could further reverse the regulation function.







Abstract
Optical control of protein activity represents a promising strategy for precise modulation of biological processes. We report rationally designed, aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) capable of noninvasive and programmable regulation of target protein activity by deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The photoresponsive SNAs are constructed by integrating activatable aptamer modules onto the surface of upconversion nanoparticles. The SNAs remain inert but can be remotely reverted by NIR light irradiation to capture the target protein and thus function as an enzyme inhibitor, while introduction of antidote DNA could further reverse their inhibition functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of the SNAs as controllable anticoagulants for the NIR light&#8208;triggered regulation of thrombin function. Ultimately, the availability of diverse aptamers would allow the design to regulate the activities of various proteins in a programmable manner.

         <title>A Dinuclear Metallobridged Super Aryl&#8208;Extended Calix[4]pyrrole Cavitand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole with 2&#8197;equivalents of cis&#8208;protected [M(dppp)(OTf)2] as the metal corners (M=Pt, Pd; dppp=1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane) has led to the formation of a dinuclear metallobridged cavitand. Inclusion complexes of the metallocavitand are formed as single conformers and the dimensions of their open portals are dependent of the included guests.







Abstract
A super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole equipped with four oxazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyrazinyl units at its upper rim is reported. Its PtII/PdII&#8208;metallobridged cavitand counterparts were obtained by treatment with 2&#8197;equiv of cis&#8208;protected metal corners, [M(dppp)(OTf)2] (dppp=1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane). The metal corners arranged their axial phenyl substituents near the aromatic walls of the cavitand leading to the formation of inclusion complexes as single conformers. We characterized the inclusion complexes in solution using NMR spectroscopy. Selected complexes were also characterized in the gas&#8208;phase and in the solid&#8208;state using mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The dimensions of the open portals of the dinuclear complexes were found to be dependent on the included guest. The results of DFT calculations served to explain the dissimilar complexation&#8208;induced shifts observed in the dinuclear inclusion complexes with mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;formamide guests.

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Mammalian Cells by 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional 19F spectra of proteins can be easily detected in mammalian cells in contrast to 2D 1H&#8208;15N HSQC spectra that can be rendered invisible by interactions with cellular components. Importantly, distances can be measured by 19F PREs for proteins in their cellular milieu, paving the way for studying structure and dynamics while proteins perform their function.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate protein behavior in physiologically relevant environments. Although proven valuable for disordered proteins, we show that in commonly used 1H&#8208;15N HSQC spectra of globular proteins, interactions with cellular components often broaden resonances beyond detection. This contrasts 19F spectra in mammalian cells, in which signals are readily observed. Using several proteins, we demonstrate that surface charges and interaction with cellular binding partners modulate linewidths and resonance frequencies. Importantly, we establish that 19F paramagnetic relaxation enhancements using stable, rigid Ln(III) chelate pendants, attached via non&#8208;reducible thioether bonds, provide an effective means to obtain accurate distances for assessing protein conformations in the cellular milieu.

         <title>Endo&#8208;M Mediated Chemoenzymatic Approach Enables Reversible Glycopeptide Labeling for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;GlcNAc moieties can be efficiently ligated with long glycans using an Endo&#8208;M mutant, and the attached glycans can be reversibly removed by wild&#8208;type Endo&#8208;M/S to restore the O&#8208;GlcNAc moiety. By combining this reversible chemoenzymatic labeling and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) method, a tag&#8208;free O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptide enrichment approach was developed.







Abstract
To selectively enrich O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) peptides in their original form from complex samples, we report the first reversible chemoenzymatic labeling approach for proteomic analysis. In this strategy, the O&#8208;GlcNAc moieties are ligated with long N&#8208;glycans using an Endo&#8208;M mutant, which enables the enrichment of the labeled glycopeptides by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The attached glycans on the enriched glycopeptides are removed by wild&#8208;type Endo&#8208;M/S to restore the O&#8208;GlcNAc moiety. Compared with classic chemoenzymatic labeling, this approach enables the tag&#8208;free identification, and eliminates the interference of bulky tags in glycopeptide detection. This approach presents a unique avenue for the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation to promote its mechanism research.

         <title>A Kinetic and Fluorogenic Enhancement Strategy for Labeling of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acridine&#8211;tetrazine probe &#8220;PINK&#8221; was designed to overcome previous shortcomings of bioorthogonal labeling within tightly packed chromatin of living cells. High&#8208;affinity intercalation of the probe enhances its inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with vinyl&#8208;modified nucleic acids in both a kinetic and fluorogenic manner to allow for a &#8220;mix and measure&#8221; assay for DNA replication and RNA synthesis in living cells.







Abstract
Chemical modification of nucleic acids in living cells can be sterically hindered by tight packing of bioorthogonal functional groups in chromatin. To address this limitation, we report here a dual enhancement strategy for nucleic acid&#8208;templated reactions utilizing a fluorogenic intercalating agent capable of undergoing inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions with DNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (VdU) or RNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;uridine (VU). Reversible high&#8208;affinity intercalation of a novel acridine&#8211;tetrazine conjugate &#8220;PINK&#8221; (KD=5&#177;1&#8197;&#956;M) increases the reaction rate of tetrazine&#8211;alkene IEDDA on duplex DNA by 60&#8201;000&#8208;fold (590&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) as compared to the non&#8208;templated reaction. At the same time, loss of tetrazine&#8211;acridine fluorescence quenching renders the reaction highly fluorogenic and detectable under no&#8208;wash conditions. This strategy enables live&#8208;cell dynamic imaging of acridine&#8208;modified nucleic acids in dividing cells.

         <title>Enhancing Circulation and Tumor Accumulation of Carboplatin via an Erythrocyte&#8208;Anchored Prodrug Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The short circulatory half&#8208;lives and low tumor accumulation of carboplatin greatly limit the drug&#8217;s efficacy in vivo. Herein, we address these challenges by using a prodrug strategy and present the rational design of a novel platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes. This prodrug, designated as ERY1&#8208;Pt(IV), can bind to erythrocytes efficiently and stably, possessing a circulatory half&#8208;life 18.5 times longer than that of carboplatin in mice. This elongated circulatory half&#8208;life enables platinum to accumulate at levels 7.7 times higher than with carboplatin, with steady levels in the tumors. As a consequence, the ERY1&#8208;Pt(IV) prodrug is proved to exhibit significantly enhanced antitumor activity and reduced side effects compared with carboplatin. Collectively, our novel approach highlights an efficient strategy to utilize intrinsic erythrocytes as auto&#8208;binding carriers to enhance the tumor accumulation and subsequent antitumor efficacy of platinum drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Acyclic (L)&#8208;Threoninol Nucleic Acid Four Way Junction with High Stability in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotides are increasingly being used as a programmable connection material to assemble molecules and proteins in well&#8208;defined structures. For the application of such assemblies for in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics it is crucial that the oligonucleotides form highly stable, non&#8208;toxic, and non&#8208;immunogenic structures. Only few oligonucleotide derivatives fulfil all of these requirements. Here we report on the application of acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (aTNA) to form a four&#8208;way junction (4WJ), that is highly stable and enables facile assembly of components for in vivo treatment and imaging. The aTNA 4WJ is serum stable, shows no non&#8208;targeted uptake or cytotoxicity, and invokes no innate immune response. As a proof of concept, we modify the 4WJ with a cancer&#8208;targeting and a serum half&#8208;life extension moiety and show the effect of these functionalized 4WJs in vitro and in vivo respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Magnetic Mechanistic Study of Ni&#8208;seamed Pyrogallol[4]arene Nanocapsules Reveal Presence of Novel Cylindrical and Spherical species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The magnetic properties of nickel&#8208;seamed  C  &#8208;pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC3Ni) hexamers and dimers are studied for the first time in solution. The combination of small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer measurements of the solution species reveal their paramagnetic and weakly antiferromagnetic behaviour. Surprisingly, the magnetic results indicated the presence of an unprecedented 13 &#197;&#8208;radius species, larger than both the dimeric and hexameric nanocapsules with both octahedral and square planar metal centers. To confirm the presence of this novel species, we performed a mechanistic study of PgC3Ni as a function of temperature and solvent and deduced the presence of two additional new species: (a) an 11 &#197; cylinder with Ni atoms seaming the tubular framework and (b) an 8 &#197;&#8208;radius sphere with non&#8208;interacting Ni centers located within the internal cavity. Select parameters that shift the equilibrium towards desired species are also identified.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selective separation using porous adsorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional separation techniques. Stacked porous organic molecular frameworks (POMF) capable of noncovalent &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation.

         <title>Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes: Synthesis, Structures, and Ring Reconstruction via Atom Transfer under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monoazadichalcogenasumanenes was synthesized that are deep &#960;&#8208;bowls with the bowl&#8208;depth reaching up to 0.95&#8197;&#197;, and thus exceeding that of corannulene. They undergo ring reconstruction under acidic conditions, as a result of protonation&#8208;induced chalcogen atom transfer.







Abstract
Buckybowls have unique properties that can be tailored by embedding main&#8208;group elements into their &#960;&#8208;scaffolds. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed for producing monoazadichalcogenasumanenes (4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b) derived from sumanene by replacing its three benzylic carbons with one nitrogen and two chalcogen atoms (S for 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, Se for 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, Te for 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b). Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes are deeper &#960;&#8208;bowls than trichalcogensumanenes as the C&#8722;N bond is much shorter than C&#8722;X (X=S, Se, Te). The bowl&#8208;depth of 4&#8201;b (0.95&#8197;&#197;) is greater than that of corannulene (0.85&#8197;&#197;). The nitrogen atom donates electron density to the entire &#960;&#8208;system that makes monoazadichalcogenasumanenes electron&#8208;rich. They undergo ring reconstruction of chalcogenophene ring via transferring a chalcogen atom from one molecule to another under acidic conditions. The nitrogen and chalcogen atoms play crucial role on this reaction.

     alt="Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes: Synthesis, Structures, and Ring Reconstruction via Atom Transfer under Acidic Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of monoazadichalcogenasumanenes was synthesized that are deep &#960;-bowls with the bowl-depth reaching up to 0.95&#8197;&#197;, and thus exceeding that of corannulene. They undergo ring reconstruction under acidic conditions, as a result of protonation-induced chalcogen atom transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckybowls have unique properties that can be tailored by embedding main-group elements into their &#960;-scaffolds. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed for producing monoazadichalcogenasumanenes (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/7&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;) derived from sumanene by replacing its three benzylic carbons with one nitrogen and two chalcogen atoms (S for &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, Se for &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, Te for &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a/7&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;). Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes are deeper &#960;-bowls than trichalcogensumanenes as the C&#8722;N bond is much shorter than C&#8722;X (X=S, Se, Te). The bowl-depth of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; (0.95&#8197;&#197;) is greater than that of corannulene (0.85&#8197;&#197;). The nitrogen atom donates electron density to the entire &#960;-system that makes monoazadichalcogenasumanenes electron-rich. They undergo ring reconstruction of chalcogenophene ring via transferring a chalcogen atom from one molecule to another under acidic conditions. The nitrogen and chalcogen atoms play crucial role on this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrazone and Oxime Olefination via Ruthenium Alkylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefination of carbon&#8211;heteroatom double bonds is a powerful approach to access highly functionalized olefins. An approach is reported here that uses air&#8208;stable and commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes to promote C=N/olefin ring closure. The enabling strategy for this reaction is the use of hydrazones and oximes as readily accessible substrates that preferentially react with ruthenium alkylidenes, even in the presence of carbonyl groups.







Abstract
We describe the development of an efficient method for the olefination of hydrazones and oximes. The key design approach that enables this transformation is tuning of the energy/polarity of C=N &#960;&#8208;bonds by employing heteroatom functionalities (NR2, OR). The resulting hydrazones or oximes facilitate olefination with ruthenium alkylidenes. Through this approach, we show that air&#8208;stable, commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes provide access to functionalized alkenes (20 examples) in ring&#8208;closing reactions with yields up to 88&#8201;%.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Electron Density Study of the Chemical Bonding Origin of Glass Formation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical bonding difference between the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni MOF and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni was investigated by 25&#8197;K X&#8208;ray electron density analysis, and multi&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography establishing the correlation between chemical bonding and meltability in MOFs. Then systematic tuning of the thermal stability with Co doping was demonstrated in a series of CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3&#8211;0.003) MOF solid solutions.







Abstract
Glass&#8208;forming metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have novel applications, but the origin of their peculiar melting behavior is unclear. Here, we report synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction electron densities of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni. Electron density analysis shows that the Zn&#8722;N bonds are more ionic than the Co&#8722;N bonds, which have distinct covalent features. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectra reveal the onset of significant imidazolate bond weakening in Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni above 673&#8197;K. Melting can be controlled by tuning the metal&#8211;ligand and imidazole bonding strength as shown from thermal analysis of nine solid&#8208;solution CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3 to 0.003) MOFs, and a mere 4&#8201;% Co&#8208;doping into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni results in thermal decomposition instead of melting. The present findings demonstrate the key role of the metal&#8211;ligand bonds and imidazolate bonds in controlling the delicate balance between melting and decomposition processes in this class of ZIF compounds.

         <title>Asymmetric Redox Allylic Alkylation to Access 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Oxindoles Enabled by Ni/NHC Cooperative Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and nickel cooperative catalysis enables asymmetric redox allylic alkylation to access 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The feasibility of cooperative catalysis between chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and nickel in asymmetric reactions has been demonstrated convincingly. The high efficiency of this catalytic system enables the asymmetric allylic alkylation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with allylic carbonates and [3+3] annulation with racemic vinyl epoxides to provide straightforward access to highly enantioenriched 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles. The great practicality of this method in organic synthesis has been showcased by facile product modification and enantioselective synthesis of the key building block to access (&#8722;)&#8208;debromoflustramine B.

         <title>A General Design Strategy Enabling the Synthesis of Hydrolysis&#8208;Resistant, Water&#8208;Stable Titanium(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thorough characterization of aqueous stable bidentate chelate systems with Ti4+ including speciation, DFT, and structural characterization of key complexes is reported. Hexadentate analogs of the high&#8208;performing bidentate chelators were also assessed and were assessed for the potential use in kit&#8208;based PET imaging with 45Ti4+.







Abstract
Despite its prevalence in the environment, the chemistry of the Ti4+ ion has long been relegated to organic solutions or hydrolyzed TiO2 polymorphs. A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti4+ species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as radioimaging, design of water&#8208;compatible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous&#8208;phase catalysis applications. Herein, we show a thorough thermodynamic screening of bidentate chelators with Ti4+ in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analyses of key compounds. In addition, the hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol) and deferiprone (3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;pyridone), TREN&#8208;CAM and THPMe respectively, were assessed for chelation of the 45Ti isotope (t1/2=3.08&#8197;h, &#946;+=85&#8201;%, E&#946;+=439&#8197;keV) towards positron emission tomography (PET) imaging applications. Both were found to have excellent capacity for kit&#8208;formulation, and [45Ti]Ti&#8208;TREN&#8208;CAM was found to have remarkable stability in vivo.

         <title>Light&#8208;Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvester Using Photoactive Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework membrane has been fabricated by a facile cathodic deposition method. The high ion selectivity and permeability endow the MOF membrane with a great performance in osmotic energy harvesting, and this performance can be further improved by the photoactive porphyrin ligands upon light irradiation.







Abstract
High ion selectivity and permeability, as two contradictory aspects for the membrane design, highly hamper the development of osmotic energy harvesting technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra&#8208;small and high&#8208;density pores and functional surface groups show great promise in tackling these problems. Here, we propose a facile and mild cathodic deposition method to directly prepare crack&#8208;free porphyrin MOF membranes on a porous anodic aluminum oxide for osmotic energy harvesting. The abundant carboxyl groups of the functionalized porphyrin ligands together with the nanoporous structure endows the MOF membrane with high cation selectivity and ion permeability, thus a large output power density of 6.26&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved. The photoactive porphyrin ligands further lead to an improvement of the power density to 7.74&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 upon light irradiation. This work provides a promising strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance osmotic energy harvesting systems.

         <title>Cooperative Assembly of 2D&#8208;MOF Nanoplatelets into Hierarchical Carpets and Tubular Superstructures for Advanced Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, DUT&#8208;134(Cu), nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble into carpet&#8208;like mesocrystals offering enhanced accessibility of open metal sites for air&#8208;filtration applications.







Abstract
Clean air is an indispensable prerequisite for human health. The capture of small toxic molecules requires the development of advanced materials for air filtration. Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials offer highly accessible surface areas but for real&#8208;world applications their assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical mesostructures is essential. DUT&#8208;134(Cu) ([Cu2(dttc)2]n, dttc=dithieno[3,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate]) is a metal&#8211;organic framework forming platelet&#8208;shaped particles, that can be organized into complex structures, such as millimeter large free&#8208;standing layers (carpets) and tubes. The structured material demonstrates enhanced accessibility of open metal sites and significantly enhanced H2S adsorption capacity in gas filtering tests compared with traditional bulk analogues.

         <title>Aromaticity and Extrusion of Benzenoids Linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;: Clar Has the Answer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clar has the answer! Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets justify the reason why the linked system of [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and benzenoid drives to extrusion in the case of naphthalene or anthracene, but not for benzene, pyrene or perylene.







Abstract
Benzene and pyrene can be synthetically linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; keeping their aromaticity. In contrast, naphthalene and anthracene are extruded in the same reaction. We have proven that extrusion is only favorable if the number of Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets remains constant. Thus, Clar has the answer to whether an attached polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; is extruded or not.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate Catalyzes the Dehydrocoupling of Phenylphosphine Borane to High Molar Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes are an emerging class of p&#8208;block element&#8208;based polymers. To date, their synthesis with high molecular weights was reserved for catalysts featuring transition metals. Calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is introduced as the first transition metal&#8208;free catalytic system for the dehydropolymerization of phenylphosphine borane. Initial mechanistic investigations indicate metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity of the aluminate.







Abstract
High molar weight polyphosphinoboranes represent materials with auspicious properties, but their preparation requires transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Here, calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is shown to induce the dehydropolymerization of phosphine boranes to high molar mass polyphosphinoboranes (up to Mn=43&#8201;000&#8197;Da). Combined GPC and 31P DOSY NMR spectroscopic analyses, quantum chemical computations, and stoichiometric reactions disclose a P&#8722;H bond activation by the cooperative action of the square&#8208;planar aluminate and the electron&#8208;rich ligand framework. This first transition metal&#8208;free catalyst for P&#8722;B dehydrocoupling overcomes the problem of residual d&#8208;block metal impurities in the resulting polymers that might interfere with the reproducibility of the properties for this emerging class of inorganic materials.

         <title>Mediating Oxidation of Thioethers with Iodine&#8212;A Mild and Versatile Pathway to Trigger the Formation of Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the formation of peptide hydrogels utilizing a mediating redox reaction based on the oxidation of thioethers with iodine is presented. Protons generated during oxidation trigger the efficient hydrogelation of peptides from alkaline precursor solutions.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;triggerable peptide hydrogels poses fundamental challenges, since the highly specific peptide architectures required inevitably limit the versatility of such materials. A powerful, yet rarely applied approach to bypass those barriers is the application of a mediating redox reaction to gradually decrease the pH during hydrogel formation. We report a versatile strategy to trigger the formation of peptide hydrogels from readily accessible acid&#8208;triggerable gelators by generating protons by oxidation of thioethers with triiodide. Adding thiodiglycol as a readily available thioether auxiliary to the basic precursor solution of a peptide gelator efficiently yielded hydrogels after mixing with triiodide, as studied in detail for Nap&#8208;FF and demonstrated for other peptides. Furthermore, incorporation of the thioether moiety in the gelator backbone via the amino acid methionine, as shown for the tailormade Nap&#8208;FMDM peptide, reduces the number of required additives.

         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) preferentially permeate prokaryotic membranes via electrostatic binding and membrane remodeling.&#160;Such action is drastically suppressed by high salt due to increased electrostatic screening, thus it is puzzling how marine AMPs can possibly work.&#160;We examine as a model system piscidin&#8208;1, a histidine&#8208;rich marine AMP, and show that ion&#8208;histidine interactions play unanticipated roles in membrane remodeling at high salt: Histidines can simultaneously hydrogen&#8208;bond to a phosphate and coordinate with an alkali metal ion to neutralize phosphate charge, thereby facilitating multidentate bonds to lipid headgroups in order to generate saddle&#8208;splay curvature, a prerequisite to pore&#8208;formation. A comparison among Na  +  , K  +  , and Cs  +  &#160;indicates that histidine&#8208;mediated salt tolerance is ion specific. We conclude that histidine plays a unique role in enabling protein/peptide&#8208;membrane interactions that occur in marine or other high&#8208;salt environment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lewis pair polymerization has demonstrated its uniuqe advantages and powerful capability in polymer synthesis. Here we employ strong nucleophilic  N  &#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) and bulky organoaluminum to construct frustrated Lewis pair, which can realize the compounded sequence control copolymerization (CSC) and self&#8208;assembly the mixture of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and fluoride&#8208;functionalized methacrylate into diblock copolymers (di&#8208;BCPs) nano&#8208;assemblies through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly in one&#8208;pot, single&#8208;step manner within minutes. These di&#8208;BCPs were characterized by  1H and  13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and TEM. By utilizing appropriate solvophilic block and solvophobic block, such Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy enables the expeditious, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of di&#8208;BCP nanoparticles with different morphologies, including spheres, worms, vesicles, and even fibers, thus suggesting the great application potential of such method in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Partners in Asymmetric Catalysis Copolymerization: Highly Enantioselective and Controllable at Enhanced Temperatures and Low Loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent enantioselectivity, activity and no transesterification side reactions were achieved in the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxides and anhydrides at low catalyst loadings or/and enhanced temperatures via intramolecularly bimetallic and multichiral synergistic catalysis.







Abstract
Asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide and anhydride is a powerful strategy for preparing various isotactic polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers. However, the previous binary systems suffered from slow rates at low loadings, poor enantioselectivities and transesterification reactions at enhanced temperatures. Herein, we report novel dinuclear aluminium complexes with multiple chiralities and ammonium salts anchored on ligand frameworks. These bifunctional catalysts exhibit high activities and enantioselectivities for epoxides/anhydrides copolymerizations at harsh conditions via intramolecularly synergistic catalysis, affording polyesters with unprecedented molecular weights and narrow distributions. Notably, no transesterification reactions were observed, significantly different from the binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs. This study represents a rare example regarding temperature&#8208;independent asymmetric induction for preparing chiral polymers from achiral monomers.

         <dc:description>Although bowl&#8208;shaped N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic

hydrocarbons (PAHs) can achieve excellent electron&#8208;donating ability,

their application for optoelectronics is hampered by typically low

we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of curved and

fully conjugated nitrogen&#8208;doped PAHs. Through structural

modifications to the electron&#8208;accepting moiety, we are able to switch

the mechanism of luminescence between TADF and RTP, and to tune

the overall PLQY in the range from 9% to 86%. As a proof of concept,

we constructed solid&#8208;state OLED devices which has not been

explored so far in the context of concave N&#8208;doped systems being

TADF/RTP emitters. The best&#8208;performing dye, possessing peripheral

trifluoromethyl group adjacent to phenazine acceptor, exhibits yellow

to orange emission with a maximum external EL quantum efficiency

(EQE) of 12%, which is the highest EQE in an curved D&#8208;A embedded

N&#8208;PAH to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing Macrocyclic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of sterically hindered C&#8211;C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small&#8208;size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C&#8208;8 alkene chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans&#8208;Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis arrangement (cis&#8208;Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis.</dc:description>

A new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores was developed. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible.







Abstract
Adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane luminophores are an important class of chemiluminescent molecular probes for diagnostics and imaging. We have developed a new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. In a following simple step, the dioxetane is obtained by oxidation of the enolether precursor with singlet&#8208;oxygen. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible. Such a late&#8208;stage derivatization strategy simplifies the rapid exploration of novel luminogenic molecular structures in a library format and simplifies the synthesis of known dioxetane luminophores. We expect that this new synthetic strategy will be particularly useful in the design and synthesis of yet unexplored dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1&#8208;CuO Catalyst for Boosting Acetone Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly active single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and identifying their intrinsic active sites in oxidizing industrial hazardous hydrocarbons are challenging prospects. Tuning the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs) is valid for modulating the catalytic performance of SACs. Herein, we propose that the EMSIs modulation of a Pt1&#8208;CuO SAC significantly promotes its activity in acetone oxidation. This EMSI is determined to promote the charge redistribution through the unified Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Cu moieties, which modulates the d&#8208;band structure of atomic Pt sites, and strengthens the adsorption and activation of reactants. The positively charged Pt atoms are superior for activating acetone at low temperatures, then the stretched Cu&#8722;O bonds in&#8208;turn facilitate the activation of lattice oxygens to participate in the followed oxidation. We strongly consider that this work will guide researchers to engineer efficient SACs in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation Using Silyl&#8208;Bipyridine Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NNSi pincer ligands served as suitable ligands for iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based ligand was shown to be an excellent one. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.







Abstract
New ligands for the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aliphatic compounds were established. In sharp contrast to 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 6&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives bearing a hydrosilylmethyl group (which would give a thermally stable NNSi pincer complex) served as suitable ligands for the reaction. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand was shown to be an excellent ligand, and various aliphatic compounds were efficiently converted to the corresponding borylated products using the Ir/NNSi pincer catalyst system. The NNSi pincer ligand showed unique selectivity and enabled the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation using pinacolborane [H&#8722;B(pin)] instead of B2(pin)2. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.

         <title>Synthesis of FeIII and FeIV Cyanide Complexes Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents as Cyano&#8208;Transfer One&#8208;Electron Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes react with iron(II) and iron(III) complexes as cyano&#8208;transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants. This approach enables the straightforward synthesis of iron(III) and iron(IV) cyanide complexes, which have been thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer and NMR spectroscopies and computational methods.







Abstract
We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes as group transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants to synthesize FeIII and FeIV cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high&#8208;valent FeIV compounds without &#960;&#8208;donor ligands (such as oxido (O2&#8722;), imido (RN2&#8722;) or nitrido (N3&#8722;)) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an FeIV cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeCN] (4) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from FeII precursor [(N3N&#8242;)FeLi(THF)] (1) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The FeIV complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII] (3) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of FeII with 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(1H)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of FeIII cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII(CN)(Li)(THF)3] (2&#8208;LiTHF). Complexes 4 and 2&#8208;LiTHF have been structurally characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Chiral Terminal Allylic Alcohols with a Titanium Salalen Catalyst and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of chiral secondary allylic alcohols, one substrate enantiomer is predominantly converted to the anti&#8208;epoxy alcohol. We herein report the first highly syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of terminal allylic alcohols using a titanium salalen complex as catalyst, at room temperature, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. With enantiopure terminal allylic alcohols as substrates, the epoxy alcohols were obtained with up to 98 % yield and up to &gt; 99:1 dr (syn). Catalyst loadings as low as&#160;1 mol % can be applied without eroding the syn&#8208;diastereoselectivity. Modification of the allylic alcohol to an ether does not affect the diastereoselectivity either [&gt; 99:1 dr (syn)]. Inverting the catalyst configuration leads to the anti&#8208;product, albeit at lower dr (ca. 20:1). The synthetic potential is demonstrated by a short, gram&#8208;scale preparation of a tetrahydrofuran building block with three stereo&#172;centers, involving two titanium salalen catalyzed epoxidation steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Enlightening the &#8220;Spirit Molecule&#8221;:&#160;Photomodulation of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor by a Light&#8208;Controllable N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non&#8208;ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5&#8208;HT  2A  receptor (5&#8208;HT  2A  R) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5&#8208;HT  2A  R agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT&#8208;indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red&#8208;shifted ligands which can be operated with visible light. Among these azo&#8208;DMTs, compound  2h  (&#8220;Photo&#8208;DMT&#8221;) stands out as its  cis  isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the  trans  isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a  cis  &#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5&#8208;HT  2A  R signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>LiBF4&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Desymmetrization of a Palladium&#8208;Ligand Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thirteen palladium&#8208;ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF4 resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd2L4]2 complex into a low&#8208;symmetry [Pd4L8]8+ assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF4 ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li+, indicating highly specific host&#8208;guest interaction. A structural analysis of the [Pd4L8]8+ &#160;receptor revealed a compact structure with multiple intramolecular interactions, reminiscent of what is seen for natural and synthetic foldamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggering near&#8208;infrared luminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine by charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating electrofluorochromism phenomena at the molecular level is essential for understanding and improving the performance of optoelectronic devices. Here we report the strongly charge&#8208;state&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) of vanadyl phthalocyanine. We describe vibrationally resolved absorption and laser&#8208;induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of samples comprising both the neutral molecule (VOPc  &#8226;  , a stable radical) and its cation isolated in 5 K neon matrices. Ionization of the essentially non&#8208;emissive VOPc  &#8226;  forms a high&#8208;spin diradical cation (VOPc  +&#8226;&#8226;  ) which shows profound PL in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. This has implications for future NIR&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;optical devices based on this commonly available chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cycloisomerization/Cross&#8208;Coupling of Carbonyl&#8208; and Imine&#8208;Tethered Alkylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd(0) catalysts featuring phosphorous&#8208;based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization / cross&#8208;coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;&#8208;allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8208;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine&#8208;tethered ACP&#8217;s is also feasible. Therefore, the method provides a straightforward and stereoselective entry to a wide variety of highly functionalized cyclic alcohols and amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of a Hydrido&#8208; and Imido&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear Ytterbium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido and imido complexes are of versatile reactivity, and many such complexes have been synthesized. However, no example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands has been reported. Herein, we report the first rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands, namely hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex. The complex was synthesized via an unprecedented redox reaction of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido complex with azido compound. DFT calculation indicated that the N  2  release from azido compound in the presence of ytterbium(II) is a kinetically facile process because of the synergistic effects of the two metal centers. The reactivity of the hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex was also explored, which showed the redox, addition and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendrite issues for Zn anodes in  a  flexible cell configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key application of aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;based batteries (RZBs) is flexible and wearable energy storage devices (FESDs). Current studies and optimizations of Zn anodes have not considered the special flexible working modes. In this study, we present the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curve areas. The correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells is proposed. Interface contact of hydrogel electrolytes when working in a bending mode is another key factor affecting cell lifespan. After detailed analysis, the ideal cell configuration is to apply hydrogel electrolytes with suitable chemistry, satisfactory mechanical properties, and high adhesivity. Based on the criteria, a water in salt (WIS) hydrogel is proposed to satisfy those criteria and demonstrate highly stable cell performance. This work has provided a brand&#8208;new perspective toward Zn anode research and is a good starting point to propel the development of FESDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Adaptive Capillarity Enabling Densified 3D Printing for&#160;Ultra&#8208;High Areal and Volumetric Energy Density&#160;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging.&#160;In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time.&#160;The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well&#8208;maintained structural integrity.&#160;Furthermore, simultaneous in&#8208;situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical micro&#8208;meso porosity are readily realized upon post&#8208;carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics.&#160;As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Thermal Expansion in Supramolecular Halogen&#8208;Bonded Mixed Cocrystals through Synthetic Feed and Dynamic Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one&#8208;dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen&#8208;bond donor is fixed, while the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM&#8208;EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite&#8208;Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With fascinating photophysical properties and strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8208;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Biosynthesis of Semiconductor Nanocrystals for Photocatalytic NAD(P)H Regeneration and Chiral Amine Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of predesigned bioengineered proteins for self&#8208;grown nanomaterials is a promising strategy that opens new scientific directions for biotic&#8208;abiotic nano&#8208;bio hybrid configurations. The unique properties of nanomaterials can alter the original biological paradigm to allow novel metabolic routes or new activation triggers. In this work, we present a synthetic methodology for self&#8208;grown cadmium sulfide quantum dots in a 12&#8208;mer bioengineered stable protein 1 under ambient conditions. The sized controlled crystalline QDs are characterized and utilized for NADPH regeneration that is in turn used for the activation of the imine reductase enzyme. The presented nano&#8208;bio hybrid system enables the production of a single enantiomeric product that is required for the pharmaceutical industry. Our designed system presents superior activity and can continuously operate for at least 22hrs with 82% conversion efficiency. The obtained results may lay the foundations for future nano&#8208;bio hybrid systems that can operate both  in vitro  and  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>BN&#8208;Anthracene for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Optoelectronic Materials through Periphery Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8208;N bonds (BN&#8208;PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN&#8208;PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Tetraphenyl&#8208; and diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracenes (TPBNA and DPBNA, respectively) are designed and synthesized. DPBNA exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.3 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, significantly outperforming TPBNA and all the reported BN&#8208;PAHs. Remarkably, this is the first BN&#8208;PAH with mobility over 1 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , which is a benchmark value for practical applications as compared with amorphous silicon. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance phototransistors based on DPBNA are also demonstrated, implying the high potential of BN&#8208;PAHs for optoelectronic applications when the &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy is implemented.</dc:description>

         <title>The Orbital Origins of Chemical Bonding in Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncovering the peculiar chemical bonding of phase&#8208;change materials is essential to understand their unique physical properties. For the first time ever, Richard Dronskowski et&#8197;al. analyze in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115778) the wavefunctions of these rather covalent materials in terms of interacting atomic orbitals, mirroring independent analyses of their projected force constants. All these materials breaking the octet rule clearly evidence electron&#8208;rich multicenter interactions, similar yet different from the molecular case.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A game of two halves: Direct ammonia oxidation unlocks a pathway towards affordable and efficient production of nitrous oxide, a highly promising agent for selective oxidation reactions, but necessitates the development of suitable catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A game of two halves: Direct ammonia oxidation unlocks a pathway towards affordable and efficient production of nitrous oxide, a highly promising agent for selective oxidation reactions, but necessitates the development of suitable catalysts. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202200772"&gt;10.1002/anie.202200772&lt;/a&gt;), Javier P&#233;rez-Ram&#237;rez and co-workers demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between Au nanoparticles and CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support results in a material with unprecedented levels of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O selectivity and productivity, far surpassing state-of-the-art systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochromism of functionalized nanographenes is reported by Ryo Sekiya, Takeharu Haino, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200291). The electrochromic behavior covered from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared region over 2000&#8197;nm. The transmittance of the light in the NIR region displayed 50&#8211;60&#8201;% change upon redox treatment.

         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;controlled polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated acetylenes is a challenging subject. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117234), Tsuyoshi Taniguchi, Katsuhiro Maeda et&#8197;al. report that unique heptaaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;hexatrienylrhodium(I) complexes induce living polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated acetylenes such as N&#8208;propargylamides. This method enables controlling molecular weights of the resultant polymers and the synthesis of telechelic polymers and block copolymers based on poly(N&#8208;propargylamide)s.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has captured extensive attention given the mutually strengthening therapeutic outcomes towards both original tumor and abscopal tumor. Herein, a versatile theranostic agent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission tendency, namely TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ, is elaborately designed and prepared by recommending benzo[c]thiophene unit as a building block, and allows to simultaneously possess fluorescence imaging (FLI) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), and thermal tumoricidal functions. Further experiments validate that TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) can not only remarkably destroy primary tumor but also enhance the immunogenicity for further suppressing the growth of tumor in the distant sites. Furthermore, PTT combining programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody prominently prevent the metastasis and recurrence of cancer by potentiating the effect of immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8208;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500 nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940 nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Zeolitic Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel zeolite&#8208;like materials with large channel windows and high stability is of importance but remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a 3D covalent organic framework with zeolitic network, namely the zeolitic organic framework (ZOF). By combining two kinds of tetrahedral building blocks with fixed or relatively free bond angles, ZOF&#8208;1 with the zeolitic  crb  net has been successfully synthesized. Its structure was determined by the single&#8208;crystal 3D electron diffraction technique. Remarkably, ZOF&#8208;1 shows high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16 &#197;), and excellent specific surface area (~ 2785 m  2  /g), which is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks. This study thus opens a new avenue to construct zeolite&#8208;like materials with pure organic frameworks and will promote their potential applications in adsorption and catalysis for macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Cyanine J&#8208;type Aggregate Nanoparticles with Enhanced Photosensitization for Mitochondria&#8208;targeting Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanines have been widely used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in biomedical field, but controlling their molecular aggregates in nanoparticles (NPs) remains a major challenge. Moreover, the impact of aggregate behaviors of cyanines on the photosensitization is still unclear. Herein, the first anionic cyanine PSs based on tricyanofuran end group have been designed by achieving supramolecular J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs via counterion engineering. Our results indicate that J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs can not only bring significantly red&#8208;shifted emission, negatively charged surface, and high photostability, but also enable a significant increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency by 5&#8208;fold compared to that in the nonaggregate state, providing strong experimental evidence for the superiority of J&#8208;aggregates in enhancing photosensitization. Thus, combined with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, the J&#8208;type aggregate NPs show remarkable  in vivo  antitumor phototheranostic efficacy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas on organic synthesis and is regarded as one of the key concepts to minimize the ecologic and economic footprint of organic synthesis. The ubiquity and low reactivity of C&#8211;H bonds in organic molecules however poses several challenges, which in turn often necessitates harsh reaction conditions to achieve this goal and it is highly desirable to achieve C&#8211;H functionalization reactions under mild conditions. Recently, several reports uncovered a conceptually new approach towards C&#8211;H functionalization, where a single transition metal complex can be used as both photosensitizer and catalyst to promote C&#8211;H bond functionalization in the absence of an exogeneous photosensitizer. In this minireview, we will provide an overview on recent achievements in C&#8211;H functionalization reactions with an emphasis on the photochemical modulation of the reaction mechanism using such catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid&#8208;state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkenes chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid&#8208;state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regioselective addition of alkynylsilanes across unactivated terminal alkenes is reported. The reaction is initiated by capture of a sterically unhindered silylium ion by a silylated phenylacetylene derivative to form a bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocation. This in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated key intermediate is virtually the actual catalyst that maintains the catalytic cycle by a series of electrophilic addition reactions of silylium ions and &#946;&#8208;silicon&#8208;stabilized carbocations. The computed reaction mechanism is fully consistent with the experimental findings. This unprecedented two&#8208;component carbosilylation establishes a C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) bond and a C(sp3)&#8211;Si bond in atom&#8208;economic fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Monooxygenation of Phenols: Evidence for a Mononuclear Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three Cu(I) salts with the very weakly coordinating anion [Al(pftb)4]&#8208; (pftb = OC(CF3)3) including the unique, linear [Cu(NEt3)2]+&#8208;cation were synthesized and examined as catalysts for the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (DTBP&#8208;H) as well as, in case of the most active catalyst, five additional different monophenols served as substrates. The activities of these Cu(I) salts towards monooxygenation of DTBP&#8208;H were compared to those of [Cu(CH3CN)4]X salts with &#8220;classic&#8221; anions ([BF4]&#8208;, [OTf]&#8208;, [PF6]&#8208;), revealing an anion effect on the activity of the catalyst and a ligand effect on the reaction rate. A drastic acceleration of the reaction rate was obtained by employing Cu(II)&#8208;semiquinone complexes as catalysts, indicating that formation of a Cu(II) complex precedes the actual catalytic cycle. This and further observations indicate that the oxygenation of monophenols in the title system does not follow a dinuclear, but a mononuclear pathway analogous to that of topaquinone cofactor biosynthesis in amine oxidase.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Sensitized by a Chromium(III) Complex via an Underexplored Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) mainly relies on precious metal complexes thanks to their high intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiencies, excited state energies, and lifetimes, while complexes of abundant first&#8208;row transition metals were only rarely utilized and with often moderate UC quantum yields. [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ (bpmp = 2,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)pyridine) containing earth&#8208;abundant chromium possesses an absorption band suitable for green light excitation, a doublet excited state energy matching the triplet energy of 9,10&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), a close to millisecond excited state lifetime, and high photostability. Combined ISC and doublet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from excited [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ to DPA gives 3DPA with close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield. TTA of 3DPA furnishes green&#8208;to&#8208;blue UC with a quantum yield of 12.0% (close to the theoretical maximum). Sterically less&#8208;hindered anthracenes undergo a [4+4] cycloaddition with [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ and green light.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Two&#8208;Axis Systems by the Catalyst&#8208; Controlled syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;Selective Arene&#8208;Forming Aldol Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous control over the configuration of multiple stereocenters is accomplished by numerous catalytic methods, providing a reliable basis for the synthesis of stereochemically complex targets in isomerically defined form. In contrast, addressing the configurations of multiple stereogenic axes with diastereodivergent catalyst control is thus far only possible by stepwise approaches. Herein we now describe that all four stereoisomers of atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems are directly tractable by assembling a central aromatic unit of teraryls through an arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation. By using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalysts, the four feasible reaction pathways are differentiated from identical substrates under defined basic conditions without preactivation, thus enabling complete stereodivergence with enantioselectivities of up to 99:1 e.r.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of 1,4&#8208;diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95% yield and up to &#65310;99% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4&#8208;diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines and chiral NH  2  &#8208;Terfenadine. Mechanistic study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds through hydroamination ring&#8208;opening and cascade hydroamination sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of [3]&#8208;Ladderanol through Late&#8208;Stage Organocatalytic Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ladderane phospholipids, with their unusual ladder&#8208;like arrangement of concatenated cyclobutane rings, represent an architecturally unique class of natural products. However, despite their fascinating structure and other necessary impetus, only a few synthetic studies of these molecules have been reported so far. We have now devised a concise total synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol, a component of ladderane phospholipids, using an organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing formal C(sp2)&#8210;H alkylation. Our synthetic strategy rests on the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality, thus allowing facile access to both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue. This is the first time a desymmetrization strategy is applied to the synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol. The scope of this desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8210;H alkylation of meso&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;fused cyclohexenediones is also presented.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of reversible oligomer/polymers is fascinating both from the perspective of the fundamental understanding as well as their applications, ranging from biomedical to self&#8208;healing smart materials. On the other hand, the reactions that occur in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion offer great details of the structure, geometry and stereochemistry of the product. However, SCSC [2+2] oligomerization is rather difficult and rare. Further, till date there are no reports for a reversible [2+2] oligomerization in SCSC fashion. In this work, four halogen substituted acrylic dienone molecules were deliberately designed and their ability to participate in [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in solid state was studied under visible light. Despite of having the required alignment of double bonds of dienes in all four crystal structures, they found to exhibit variable reactivities given the differences in their weak intermolecular interactions such as halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen, halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. Notably, one of these materials exhibits reversible oligomerization in SCSC manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite a renaissance in the activation of carborane cages in the past decades, oxidative cage functionalizations generally require stoichiometric amounts of toxic chemical oxidants. In contrast, electrochemical functionalizations enable resource&#8208;economical cage activation.







Abstract
Carboranes are boron&#8211;carbon molecular clusters that possess unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content, and delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications in supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, organometallic coordination chemistry, and as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for the oxidative activation of carborane cages. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. It is only in recent few years that considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this Minireview. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will serve as an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Potential Cathodes with Nitrogen Active Centres for Quasi&#8208;Solid Proton&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly proposed 2,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene bis((ethylsulfonyl)amide) (HDC) can deliver a high working potential and stable cycle performance over 2000&#8197;cycles in a stainless&#8208;steel case based on a nitrogen active centre.







Abstract
Although proton&#8208;ion batteries have received considerable attention owing to their reliability, safety, toxin&#8208;free nature, and low cost, their development remains in the early stages because of lacking proper electrolytes and cathodes for facilitating a high output voltage and stable cycle performance. We present a novel cathode based on active nitrogen centre, which provides a flat discharge plateau at 1&#8197;V with a capacity of 115&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent stability. Moreover, a quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte was developed to overcome the issue of corrosion, broaden the potential window of the electrolyte, and prevent the active material from dissolving. While using the unique as&#8208;developed electrolyte, the newly designed cathode retained 89.67&#8201;% of its original capacity after 2000&#8197;cycles. Finally, we demonstrated the excellent cycle performance of the as&#8208;developed metal&#8208;free, flexible, soft&#8208;packed battery. Notably, even when a portion of the battery was cut off, it continued to function normally.

         <title>4&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Butyric Acid&#8208;Assisted In Situ Passivation Strategy for Superstable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbX3 Quantum Dots in Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CsPbX3 (CPX) QDs via in situ crystallization with synergistic effects of BBA and OLA in polar solvent is proposed. The results not only provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents but also shed more light on their surface chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial challenge is to develop an in situ passivation treatment strategy for CsPbX3 (CPX, X=Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (QDs) and simultaneously retain their luminous efficiency and wavelength. Here, a facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CPX QDs via in situ crystallization with the synergistic effect of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyric acid (BBA) and oleylamine (OLA) in polar solvents including aqueous solution and a possible fundamental mechanism are proposed. Monodispersed CsPbBr3 (CPB) QDs obtained in water show high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 86.4&#8201;% and their PL features of CPB QDs have no significant change after being dispersed in aqueous solution for 96&#8197;h, which implies the structure of CPB QDs is unchanged. The results provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents and shed more light on their surface chemistry.

         <title>Organic Branched Heterostructures with Optical Interconnects for Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronic functions remains challenging. Optical interconnections based on organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) have been synthesized through a sequential self&#8208;assembly process. The accurate spatial organization has been applied to the generation of 2D barcodes.







Abstract
Optical interconnects exhibit superior potential in the precise regulation of photon transmission for organic photonic circuits. However, the rational design of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronics remains challenging. Herein, we designed organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) with accurate spatial organization for optical interconnection. Notably, the precise regulation of OBHs has been controllably achieved including the trunk morphologies and the branched microwire number. Significantly, these as&#8208;prepared OBHs inherently exhibit the multichannel coupling outputs and the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide characteristics, leading to various outcoupling signals with tunable intensity and emission colors. The optical interconnects are realized due to the occurrence of exciton conversion and photon propagation between branch and trunk at the heterojunction, benefiting the application possibilities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) optical barcodes.
