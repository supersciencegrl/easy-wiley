         <title>Giant Tunability of Charge Transport in 2D Inorganic Molecular Crystals by Pressure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique intermolecular van der Waals force in emerging two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals (2DIMCs) endows them with highly tunable structures and properties upon applying external stimuli. Using high pressure to modulate the intermolecular bonding, here we reveal the highly tunable charge transport behavior in 2DIMCs for the first time, from an insulator to a semiconductor. As pressure increases, 2D &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 molecular crystal undergoes three isostructural transitions, and the intermolecular bonding enhances gradually, which results in a considerably decreased bandgap by 25% and a greatly enhanced charge transport. Impressively, the in&#8208;situ resistivity measurement of the &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 flake shows a sharp drop by 5 orders of magnitude in 0 &#8211; 3.2 GPa. This work sheds new light on the manipulation of charge transport in 2DIMCs and is of great significance for promoting the fundamental understanding and potential applications of 2DIMCs in advanced modern technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination of Polyketide Release and Multiple Detoxification Pathways for Tolerable Production of Fungal Mycotoxins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient biosynthesis of microbial bioactive natural products (NPs) is beneficial for the survival of producers, while self&#8208;protection is necessary to avoid self&#8208;harm resulting from over&#8208;accumulation of NPs. The underlying mechanisms for the effective but tolerable production of bioactive NPs is not well understood. Here in the biosynthesis of two fungal polyketide mycotoxins aurovertin E (1) and asteltoxin (4), we show that the cyclases in the gene clusters promote the release of the polyketide backbone, and reveal that a signal peptide is crucial for their subcellular localization and full activity. Meanwhile, the fungus adopts enzymatic acetylation as the major detoxification pathway of 1. If intermediates are over&#8208;produced, the non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways work as salvage pathways to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites for self&#8208;protection. These findings provided new insights into the interplay of efficient backbone release and multiple detoxification strategies for the production of fungal bioactive NPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheets@Crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorods for High Current&#8208;density Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheets@crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorods (Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) was synthesized using a facil one&#8208;step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1,000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5delivers excellent stability for at least 300 h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect&#8208;rich amorphous structure of Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H2O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Tough and Conductive Nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy Layered Bulk Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;standing quest in materials science has been the development of tough epoxy resin nanocomposites used in numerous applications. Inspired by nacre, herein, we report tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites. The orientation of MXene lamellar scaffolds is enhanced by annealing treatment. The improved interfacial interactions between MXene lamellar scaffold and epoxy through surface chemical modification resulted in a synergistic effect. Tailoring the interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets to a critical distance resulted in the fracture toughness about eight times higher than pure epoxy, surpassing other epoxy nanocomposites. Our nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites also show high electrical conductivity that provides self&#8208;monitoring capability to the structure integrity and exhibits an excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency. Our proposed strategy provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance epoxy nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent De Novo Macrocyclic Peptides that Inhibit O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Through an Allosteric Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosyltransferases are a notoriously difficult to inhibit superfamily of enzymes. Here we apply an mRNA display technology integrated with genetic code reprogramming, referred to as the RaPID (random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery) system, to identify macrocyclic peptides with high binding affinities for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). These macrocycles inhibit OGT activity through an allosteric mechanism that is driven by their binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT. Saturation mutagenesis in a maturation screen using 39 amino acids, including 22 non&#8208;canonical residues, led to an improved unnatural macrocycle that is ~40 times more potent than the parent compound (Kiapp = 1.5 nM). Subsequent derivatization delivered a biotinylated derivative that enabled one&#8208;step affinity purification of OGT from complex samples. The high potency and novel mechanism of action of these OGT ligands should enable new approaches to elucidate the specificity and regulation of OGT.</dc:description>

         <title>Actinorhodin Biosynthesis Terminates with an Unprecedented Biaryl Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A plethora of dimeric natural products exist with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. A major strategy for dimerization is aryl coupling reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or laccase. Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor has a dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone structure connected by a C&#8208;C bond. Here, we identified a NmrA&#8208;family dimerizing enzyme, ActVA&#8208;ORF4, and a cofactor independent oxidase, ActVA&#8208;ORF3, both involved in the last step of ACT biosynthesis. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique &#160;NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the inter&#8208;molecular C&#8208;C bond formation using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. On the other hand, ActVA&#8208;ORF3 was found to be a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that produces the coupling substrate, DHK&#8208;OH, and the final product, ACT. Consequently, the functional assignment of all essential enzymes in ACT biosynthesis was completed, which would be a landmark in our understanding of the entire biosynthetic pathway for one of the best&#8208;known model natural products, ACT.</dc:description>

         <title>PD&#8208;L1 Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Robust Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy Against Cancer with Enhanced Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint blockade has become a paradigm&#8208;shifting treatment modality to combat cancer, while conventional administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), often shows unsatisfactory immune responses and lead to severe immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs). Herein, we develop a PD&#8208;L1 aptamer (aptPD&#8208;L1) based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which consists of an oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle core and a dense shell of aptPD&#8208;L1 (denoted as M@O&#8208;A). Upon light irradiation, such nanosystem enables concurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy and enhanced immunotherapy on one shot to inhibit both primary colorectal tumors and untreated distant tumors in mice. Notably, M@O&#8208;A shows scarcely any systemic immunotoxicity in a clinical irAEs&#8208;mimic transgenic mouse model. Collectively, this study presents a novel strategy for priming robust photo&#8208;immunotherapy against cancer with enhanced safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Catalyzes Benzene Ring Formation in the Biosynthesis of Trialkyl&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lorneic acid and related natural products are featured by a trialkyl&#8208;substituted benzene rings. The formation of the aromatic core in the middle of polyketide chain is unusual. We characterized a cytochrome P450 enzyme that can catalyze the hallmark benzene ring formation from an acyclic polyene substrate through genetic and biochemical analysis. Using this P450 as a beacon for genome mining, we obtained 12 homologous type I PKS gene clusters, among which two gene clusters are activated and are able to produce trialkyl substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work reveals a new strategy in nature to construct the benzene ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conductors have attracted great attention in various fields, especially in energy production. Here, we find that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), derived from graphdiyne (GDY), features the highest proton conductivity of 0.54 S cm&#8722;1 (100% RH, 348 K) among the oxidized carbon allotropes reported so far. The sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon skeleton of GDY enables GDYO with the giant water uptake, which is 2.4 times larger than that of graphene oxide (GO), resulting in ultrahigh proton conductivity by increasing the proton concentration and proton conduction pathways. This ultrahigh proton conductivity of GDYO is further proved in a methanol fuel cell by using GDYO membrane as proton exchange membrane. The GDYO membrane enables the cell with higher open circuit potential, larger power density and lower methanol permeability, compared with commercial Nafion 117. Moreover, the GDYO membrane bears high ion exchange capacity, good acidic stability and low swelling ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Defined Water&#8208;Soluble Metallofullerene Derivatives towards Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular metallobuckytrio (MBT) platform provides a family of structurally defined, water&#8208;soluble metallofullerene derivatives that can safely carry rare&#8208;earth elements in tailorable molecules, showing promise in biomedicines including MRI contrast agents and photosensitizers.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) are excellent carriers of rare&#8208;earth element (REE) ions in biomedical applications because they preclude the release of toxic metal ions. However, existing approaches to synthesize water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives yield mixtures that inhibit precise drug design. Here we report the synthesis of metallobuckytrio (MBT), a three&#8208;buckyball system, as a modular platform to develop structurally defined water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives with ligands by choice. Demonstrated with PEG ligands, the resulting water&#8208;soluble MBTs show superb biocompatibility. The Gd MBTs exhibit superior T1 relaxivity than typical Gd complexes, potentially superseding current clinical MRI contrast agents in both safety and efficiency. The Lu MBTs generated reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation, showing promise as photosensitizers. With their modular nature to incorporate other ligands, we anticipate the MBT platform to open new paths towards bio&#8208;specific REE drugs.

         <title>Single Crystalline, Non&#8208;stoichiometric Cocrystals of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept non&#8208;stoichiometric cocrystalline frameworks are formed using hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives with hydrogen&#8208;bonding modules, CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py. The structures and composition ratio were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Microscopic Raman spectroscopy on a single crystal showed that components are distributed gradationally and/or not homogeneously in the crystal.







Abstract
Porous frameworks composed of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed multicomponent molecules attract much attention from a functional viewpoint. However, their designed preparation and precise structural characterization remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that cocrystallization of tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives (CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py, respectively) yields non&#8208;stoichiometric mixed frameworks through networking via hydrogen bonding. The composition ratio of CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py in the framework was determined by single crystalline X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, indicating that the mixed frameworks were formed over a wide range of composition ratios. Furthermore, microscopic Raman spectroscopy on the single crystal indicates that the components are not uniformly distributed such as ideal solid solution, but are done gradationally or inhomogeneously.

Abstract
We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of periglaucines A&#8211;C, N,O&#8208;dimethyloxostephine and oxostephabenine. The key strategies used include: 1)&#8197;a RhI&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and diastereoselective Hayashi&#8208;Miyaura reaction to connect two necessary fragments; 2)&#8197;an intramolecular photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction to construct the highly functionalized tricyclic core skeleton bearing a quaternary center; 3)&#8197;a bio&#8208;inspired intramolecular Michael addition and transannular acetalization to generate the aza[4.4.3]propellane and the tetrahydrofuran ring.

A polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode is employed for high&#8208;voltage (&gt;3&#8197;V) rechargeable Mg and Ca batteries based on the tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anion storage chemistry. Mechanistic studies elucidate the unique redox mechanism of the amine moieties in the active cathode material. The dual&#8208;ion batteries exhibit both high energy and high power&#8208;density and long cycle&#8208;life.







Abstract
Multivalent batteries show promising prospects for next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we report a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode capable of highly reversible storage of tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anions in both Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) battery systems. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal the redox reaction mechanism of the PTPAn cathode material. The Mg and Ca cells exhibit a cell voltage &gt;3&#8197;V, a high&#8208;power density of &#8764;&#8764;3000&#8197;W kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;energy density of &#8764;&#8764;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, the combination of the PTPAn cathode with a calcium&#8208;tin (Ca&#8722;Sn) alloy anode could enable a long battery&#8208;life of 3000&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 60&#8201;%. The anion storage chemistry associated with dual&#8208;ion electrochemical concept demonstrates a new feasible pathway towards high&#8208;performance divalent ion batteries.

         <title>Interparticle Charge&#8208;Transport&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Quantum&#8208;Dot Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term ambiguity in mechanistic understanding of charge&#8208;transfer routes toward electrochemiluminescence generation has been deciphered in this study by designing highly tunable quantum dot aerogels as novel luminophores. The interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route has been explicitly demonstrated and selectively enhanced based on the strong electronic coupling of quantum dot aerogels.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) represents a widely explored technique to generate light, in which the emission intensity relies critically on the charge&#8208;transfer reactions between electrogenerated radicals. Two types of charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms have been postulated for ECL generation, but the manipulation and effective probing of these routes remain a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate the design of quantum dot (QD) aerogels as novel ECL luminophores via a versatile water&#8208;induced gelation strategy. The strong electronic coupling between adjacent QDs enables efficient charge transport within the aerogel network, leading to the generation of highly efficient ECL based on the selectively improved interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route. This mechanism is further verified by designing CdSe&#8208;CdTe mixed QD aerogels, where the two mechanistic routes are clearly decoupled for ECL generation. We anticipate our work will advance the fundamental understanding of ECL and prove useful for designing next&#8208;generation QD&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Characterization of a Ferryl Flip in Electronically Tuned Nonheme Complexes. Consequences in Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isomerization of pairs of electronically tunned oxoiron(IV) geometrical isomers is described, as a model for the &#8220;ferryl flip&#8221; observed in non&#8208;heme enzymes. The position of the oxo ligand in the coordination sphere of the iron center has a strong impact on the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) activity of the oxoiron(IV) compounds, while electronic effects do not play a significant role in HAT reactions.







Abstract
Two oxoiron(IV) isomers (R2a and R2b) of general formula [FeIV(O)(RPyNMe3)(CH3CN)]2+ are obtained by reaction of their iron(II) precursor with NBu4IO4. The two isomers differ in the position of the oxo ligand, cis and trans to the pyridine donor. The mechanism of isomerization between R2a and R2b has been determined by kinetic and computational analyses uncovering an unprecedented path for interconversion of geometrical oxoiron(IV) isomers. The activity of the two oxoiron(IV) isomers in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions shows that R2a reacts one order of magnitude faster than R2b, which is explained by a repulsive noncovalent interaction between the ligand and the substrate in R2b. Interestingly, the electronic properties of the R substituent in the ligand pyridine ring do not have a significant effect on reaction rates. Overall, the intrinsic structural aspects of each isomer define their relative HAT reactivity, overcoming changes in electronic properties of the ligand.

A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co&#8208;workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species. This methodology can be readily upscaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodologies, demonstrating scalability of mechanochemical catalytic processes.

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Shuttle Hetero&#8208;difunctionalization Reactions: Electrochemical Transfer Halo&#8208;thiolation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
e&#8208;Shuttle catalysis is a promising tool to transfer functional groups between molecules forth and back via a consecutive paired electrolysis mechanism. A rare example of shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization to transfer two distinct functional groups between &#946;&#8208;halosulfides and unsaturated hydrocarbons is shown by Siegfried&#8197;R. Waldvogel, Bill Morandi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213630). The preferential anodic oxidation of one anion over the other is a key technique to ensure high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity in this process.

         <title>Durable Nickel&#8208;Iron (Oxy)hydroxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts through Surface Functionalization with Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nickel&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide catalysts suffer from loss of iron under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214541), Jaeyoung Lee and co&#8208;workers report a stable OER electrocatalyst by adding tetraphenylporphyrin protective layers. They accelerate the redeposition of eluted iron onto the electrocatalyst by forming a nonpolar&#8211;polar interface. This not only prolongs the iron population but also the lifetime of the electrocatalyst.

         <title>Sonochemically&#8208;Induced Reduction of Alkenes to Alkanes with Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8722;H bond of NH3 can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the in situ formation of a diimide, which then induces the hydrogenation of alkenes, as reported by Fran&#231;ois J&#233;r&#244;me et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202212719). Advantageously, this technique does not involve any transition metal and releases N2 as a sole coproduct.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Photophysics in Hydrazone&#8208;Based Hierarchical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As hibiscus flowers bloom in the morning and close at night, hydrazone derivatives exhibit photoresponsive behavior as a function of an excitation wavelength. While hydrazone &#8220;flowers&#8221; wilt in the wrong environment, they blossom in a MOF &#8220;vase&#8221;. Thus, integration of hydrazone&#8208;photoswitches in proper 3D environments cultivates solution&#8208;like photophysical properties in solid&#8208;state materials and allows for modulation of energy transfer processes.







Abstract
Confinement&#8208;imposed photophysics was probed for novel stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrazone&#8208;based compounds demonstrating a conceptual difference in their behavior within 2D versus 3D porous matrices for the first time. The challenges associated with photoswitch isomerization arising from host interactions with photochromic compounds in 2D scaffolds could be overcome in 3D materials. Solution&#8208;like photoisomerization rate constants were realized for sterically demanding hydrazone derivatives in the solid state through their coordinative immobilization in 3D scaffolds. According to steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements and theoretical modeling, this approach provides access to hydrazone&#8208;based materials with fast photoisomerization kinetics in the solid state. Fast isomerization of integrated hydrazone derivatives allows for probing and tailoring resonance energy transfer (ET) processes as a function of excitation wavelength, providing a novel pathway for ET modulation.

         <title>Empowering Zn Electrode Current Capability Along Interfacial Stability by Optimizing Intrinsic Safe Organic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical performances of Zn metal anodes are adjusted using functionalized ionic liquid and phosphate&#8208;based safe organic solvents, resulting in high Columbic efficiency (CE) of over 99&#8201;%, long cycle life up to 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and large areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The interface derived from ionic liquid effectively accelerates the Zn nucleation, ensures smooth deposit, and reduces side reactions.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is one of the most promising anodes, but its practical application has been hindered by dendritic growth and serious interfacial reactions in conventional electrolytes. Herein, ionic liquids are adopted to prepare intrinsically safe electrolytes via combining with TEP or TMP solvents. With this synergy effect, the blends of TEP/TMP with an IL fraction of &#8776;25&#8197;wt% are found to be promising electrolytes, with ionic conductivities comparable to those of standard phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes while electrochemical stabilities are considerably improved; over 1000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and &#8776;350&#8197;h at 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The use of functionalized IL turns out to be a key factor in enhancing the Zn2+ transport due to the interaction of Zn2+ ions with IL&#8208;zincophilic sites resulting in reduced interfacial resistance between the electrodes and electrolyte upon cycling leading to spongy&#8208;like highly porous, homogeneous, and dendrite&#8208;free zinc as an anode material.

         <title>Retarding the Shuttling Ions in the Electrochromic TiO2 with Extensive Crystallographic Imperfections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct sites for ion accommodation are found in an electrochromic transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide (ETMO) nanowire film by the galvanostatic transmittance evolution: the normal site and the abnormal site. Ions at the abnormal sites contribute little to coloration but retard the shuttling rate. These findings give a clear picture of the ion shuttling process, allowing the electrochromic performance to be enhanced for the design of efficient smart windows.







Abstract
To understand the role of structure imperfections on the performance of electrochromic transition metal oxide (ETMO) is challenging for the design of efficient smart windows. Herein, we investigate the performance evolution with tunable crystallographic imperfections for rutile TiO2 nanowire film (TNF). Structure imperfections, originating mainly from the copious oxygen deficiency, are apt to cumulatively retard the shuttling ions, resulting in the response rate for raw TNF being less than the half that of TNF annealed at 500&#8201;&#176;C. We describe ion accommodation sites as a convolution of normal site and abnormal site, in which the normal site performs reversible coloration but the abnormal site contributes only to charge storage, which gives a rationale for the non&#8208;linear coloration and rate capability loss. These findings give a clear picture of the ion shuttling process, which is insightful for enhancing the electrochromic performance via structure reprogramming.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens for In Vivo Theranostics of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, was designed by balancing hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties. DNTPH displays excellent blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability and binds to &#946;&#8208;amyloid A&#946;42 fibrils selectively. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis, thus attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for near&#8208;infrared imaging of A&#946;42 plaques and AD therapy.







Abstract
Optimized theranostic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain almost absent from bench to clinic. Current probes and drugs attempting to prevent &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrosis encounter failures due to the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration challenge and blind intervention time window. Herein, we design a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, via balanced hydrophobicity&#8208;hydrophilicity strategy. DNTPH binds selectively to A&#946; fibrils with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In vivo imaging revealed its excellent BBB permeability and long&#8208;term tracking ability with high&#8208;performance AD diagnosis. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis and promotes fibril disassembly, thereby attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity. DNTPH treatment significantly reduced A&#946; plaques and rescued learning deficits in AD mice. Thus, DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for real&#8208;time NIR imaging of A&#946; plaques and AD therapy simultaneously.

         <title>Catalytic Properties of High Nitrogen Content Carbonaceous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials are attractive alternatives to metal catalysts in terms of price and reduced environmental impact. However, the influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. General trends in the catalytic activity of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons are identified using a holistic approach to carbocatalysis.







Abstract
The influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. A collection of carbonaceous materials with different pore networks and high nitrogen content was characterized and used to catalyze four reactions to deduce structure&#8211;activity relationships. The CO2 cycloaddition and Knoevenagel reaction depend on Lewis basic sites (electron&#8208;rich nitrogen species). The absence of large conjugated carbon domains resulting from the introduction of large amounts of nitrogen in the carbon network is responsible for poor redox activity, as observed through the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene with hydrazine and the catalytic oxidation of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine using hydroperoxide. The material with the highest activity towards Lewis acid catalysis (in the hydrolysis of (dimethoxymethyl)benzene to benzaldehyde) is the most effective for small molecule activation and presents the highest concentration of electron&#8208;poor nitrogen species.

         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl bromides with organoboronate esters is developed to access synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. The success of this work relies on the utilization of chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligands to forge the sterically congested C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams with organoboronate esters could provide the synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#946;&#8208;lactams. The challenge arises mainly from the construction of sterically congested quaternary stereocenters between the tertiary alkyl radicals and chiral copper(II) species. Herein, we describe our success in achieving such transformations through the utilization of a copper/hemilabile N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst to forge the sterically congested chiral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond via a single&#8208;electron reduction/transmetalation/bond formation catalytic cycle. The synthetic potential of this approach is shown in the straightforward conversion of the corresponding products into many valuable building blocks. We hope that the developed catalytic cycle would open up new vistas for more enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Chiral Open [60]Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethylaminocarbene&#8208;mediated orifice expansion gave the first near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing chiral open [60]fullerenes. The introduced aminomethylidene moiety is well&#8208;conjugated with the fullerene cage, thus considerably elevating the HOMO level as supported by the electrochemical analysis. The optical resolution revealed a large dissymmetry factor of gabs=&#177;0.12 at 820&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene.







Abstract
Though [60]fullerene is an achiral molecular nanocarbon with Ih symmetry, it could attain an inherent chirality depending upon a functionalization pattern. The conventional chiral induction of C60 relies mainly upon a multiple addition affording a mixture of achiral and chiral isomers while their chiral function would be largely offset by the existence of pseudo&#8208;mirror plane(s). These are major obstacles to proceed further study on fullerene chirality and yet leave its understanding elusive. Herein, we showcase a carbene&#8208;mediated synthesis of C1&#8208;symmetric chiral open [60]fullerenes showing an intense far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The large dissymmetry factor of |gabs|=0.12 was achieved at &#955;=820&#8197;nm for circular dichroism in benzonitrile. This is, in general, unachievable by other small chiral organic molecules, demonstrating the potential usage of open [60]fullerenes as novel types of chiral chromophores.

         <title>Conformational Control of Organocatalyst in Strongly Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acidic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enantioselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticulation of chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol&#8208;based imidodiphosphoric acid (IDP) into two Dy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) allows controlling the organocatalyst conformations and local chiral microenvironments. The MOF containing the 4&#8208;connected IDPs has a relatively less compact shape and can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalys for the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization of diol and aldehyde with up to 96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Chiral imidodiphosphates (IDPs) have emerged as strong Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts for many enantioselective processes. However, the dynamic transformation between O,O&#8208;syn and O,O&#8208;anti conformers typically results in low enantioselectivity. Here we demonstrate that topologies of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be exploited to control IDP conformations and local chiral microenvironments for enantioselective catalysis. Two porous Dy&#8208;MOFs with different topologies are obtained from an enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol IDP&#8208;based tetracarboxylate ligand. While the ligand adopts a 4&#8208; or 3&#8208;connected (c) binding mode, all IDPs are rigidified to get only a single O,O&#8208;syn conformation and display greatly enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity relative to the free IDP. The MOF with the 4&#8208;c IDP that has a relatively less compact shape than the 3&#8208;c IDP can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysing the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization reaction with up to 96&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral imidodiphosphates (IDPs) have emerged as strong Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts for many enantioselective processes. However, the dynamic transformation between &lt;i&gt;O,O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;O,O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt; conformers typically results in low enantioselectivity. Here we demonstrate that topologies of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be exploited to control IDP conformations and local chiral microenvironments for enantioselective catalysis. Two porous Dy-MOFs with different topologies are obtained from an enantiopure 1,1&#8242;-biphenol IDP-based tetracarboxylate ligand. While the ligand adopts a 4- or 3-connected (c) binding mode, all IDPs are rigidified to get only a single &lt;i&gt;O,O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; conformation and display greatly enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity relative to the free IDP. The MOF with the 4-c IDP that has a relatively less compact shape than the 3-c IDP can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysing the challenging asymmetric &lt;i&gt;O,O&lt;/i&gt;-acetalization reaction with up to 96&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Integration of Organic Core/Shell Microwires for Advanced Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a series of organic charge transfer cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability, we demonstrate the precise construction of various types of hierarchical organic microwires. Branch microwires with multichannel waveguide and core/shell microwires with multicolor waveguide performance can be integrated into branch core/shell microwires for realizing optical logic gates with multi&#8208;encoding functions.







Abstract
The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Intertwining Olefin Thianthrenation with Kornblum/Ganem Oxidations: Ene&#8208;type Oxidation to Furnish &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free double oxidation of unactivated alkenes has been developed to deliver unsaturated conjugated carbonyls. This practical procedure allows valorization of the olefinic feedstock with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity as demonstrated by the syntheses of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access building blocks and industrially relevant pheromones and kairomones.







Abstract
A widely applicable, practical, and scalable synthetic method for efficient ene&#8208;type double oxidation of alkenes is reported via a two&#8208;step alkenyl thianthrenium umpolung/Kornblum&#8208;Ganem oxidation strategy. This chemo&#8208; and stereoselective procedure allows easy access to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls that may be otherwise difficult or cumbersome to synthesize by conventional methods. For &#945;&#8208;olefins, this metal&#8208;free transformation can be tuned according to synthetic needs to produce either the elusive (Z)&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their (E) counterparts. Moreover, this strategy has enabled streamlined synthesis of distinct butadienyl pheromones and kairomones.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Probes Excited&#8208;State Delocalization in Rectangular Ladder&#8208;type Pentaphenyl Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rectangular &#960;&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers of one particular handedness provide a square answer to the question of delocalization of their lowest&#8208;energy photoexcitation: the coupling to vibrations makes the excitation shaky. Exciton localization is a dynamic process and the excitation &#8220;breathes&#8221; in concert with the zero&#8208;point vibrational motion.







Abstract
Ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl chromophores have a rigid, planar &#960;&#8208;system and show bright fluorescence featuring pronounced vibrational structure. Such moieties are ideal for studying interchromophoric interactions and delocalization of electronic excitations. We report the synthesis of helical polymers with a rigid square structure based on spiro&#8208;linked ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl units. The variation of circular dichroism with increasing chain length provides direct evidence for delocalization of electronic excitations over at least 10 monomeric units. The change in the degree of circular polarization of the fluorescence across the vibronic side bands shows that vibrational motion can localize the excitation dynamically to almost one single unit through breakdown of the Born&#8208;Oppenheimer approximation. The dynamic conversion between delocalized and localized excited states provides a new paradigm for interpreting circular dichroism in helical polymers such as proteins and polynucleic acids.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Presodiation with Sodium Diphenyl Ketone towards Ultra&#8208;stable Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium diphenyl ketone is applied as a reducing reagent to compensate irreversible Na uptake at oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and react with defective carbon for quasi&#8208;metallic Na to initiate robust SEI. It leads to ICE of 99.2&#8201;% and capacity retention of &#8776;100&#8201;% for 700&#8197;cycles in the full cells of presodiated hard carbon//Na3V2(PO4)3.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) is applied to realize dual&#8208;function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven&#8208;membered rings for quasi&#8208;metallic sodium in HC. The as&#8208;formed sodium induces robust NaF&#8208;rich SEI on HC in 1.0&#8197;M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of &#8776;100&#8201;% and capacity retention of 82.4&#8201;% after 6800&#8197;cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of &#8776;100&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles. This work provides in&#8208;depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>An Amorphous n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with an Ultra&#8208;Rigid Planar Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductors with different charge transporting mechanism. An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with rigid, straight and planar backbone has now been designed and synthesized. It is amorphous in a thin film but exhibits an electron mobility of 0.34&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High charge carrier mobility polymer semiconductors are always semi&#8208;crystalline. Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductors with different charge transporting mechanism. Here we report the first near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with decent electron mobility, which features a remarkably rigid, straight and planar polymer backbone. The molecular design strategy is to copolymerize two fused&#8208;ring building blocks which are both electron&#8208;accepting, centrosymmetrical and planar. The polymer is the alternating copolymer of double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit and benzobisthiazole (BBTz) unit. It shows a decent electron mobility of 0.34&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. The excellent electron transporting property of the polymer is possibly due to the ultrahigh backbone stiffness, small &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance, and high molecular weight.

It shows a decent electron mobility of 0.34&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in organic field-effect transistors. The excellent electron transporting property of the polymer is possibly due to the ultrahigh backbone stiffness, small &#960;-&#960; stacking distance, and high molecular weight.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;specific miRNA imaging is achieved through the integration of enzyme&#8208;triggered catalytic hairpin assembly with lipid nanoparticles&#8208;based delivery. The approach enables controlled activation of signal amplification in cancer cells with improved imaging contrast, as reported by Lele Li, Mengyuan Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214230).

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence at the Single&#8208;Nanoparticle Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An array of well&#8208;controlled Au single particle or oligomers was printed on the electrode surface, and used as high&#8208;throughput platform to investigate the plasmon enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle level. This ECL microscopy can visualize and quantify the electrochemical reactions of multiple individual NPs from wide&#8208;field imaging simultaneously.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle (NP) level was investigated by ECL microscopy. The Au NPs were assembled into an ordered array, providing a high&#8208;throughput platform that can easily locate each NP in sequential characterizations. A strong dependence of ECL intensity on Au NP configurations was observed. We demonstrate for the first time that at the single&#8208;particle level, the ECL of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;TPrA was majorly quenched by small Au NPs (&lt;40&#8197;nm), while enhanced by large Au ones (&gt;80&#8197;nm) due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Notably, the ECL intensity was further increased by the coupling effect of neighboring Au NPs. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations conformed well with the experimental results. This plasmon enhanced ECL microscopy for arrayed single NPs provides a reliable tool for screening electrocatalytic activity at a single particle.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Towards Harnessing their Full Power with Darwinian Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technologies are transforming the drug discovery process, enabling the identification of ligands at unprecedented speed and scale. DEL makes use of libraries that are orders of magnitude larger than traditional high throughput screens. While a DNA tag alludes to a genotype&#8208;phenotype connection that is exploitable for evolutionary cycles, most of the work in the field is performed with libraries where the tag serves as an amplifiable bar code but does not allow &#8216;translation&#8217; into the synthetic product it is linked to. In this review, we cover technologies that enable the &#8216;translation&#8217; of the genetic tag into synthetic molecules, both biochemically and chemically, and explore how it can be used to harness Darwinian evolutionary pressure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up preparation of two&#8208;dimensional material micro&#8208;nano structures at scale facilitates the realisation of integrated applications in optoelectronic devices. Fibrous Phosphorus (FP), an allotrope of black phosphorus (BP), is one of the most promising candidate materials in the field of optoelectronics with its unique crystal structure and properties.&#160;However, to date, there are no bottom&#8208;up micro&#8208;nano structure preparation methods for crystalline phosphorus allotropes.&#160;Herein, we present the bottom&#8208;up preparation of fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays via a low&#8208;pressure gas&#8208;phase transport (LP&#8208;CVT) method that controls the directional phase transition from amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) to FP. In addition, self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PD) of FP&#8208;MP arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects achieved detection beyond the bandgap limit. Our results provide a new approach for bottom&#8208;up preparation of other crystalline allotropes of phosphorus.</dc:description>

         <title>An Engineered OmpG Nanopore with Displayed Peptide Motifs for Single&#8208;Molecule Multiplex Protein Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular detection via nanopore, achieved by monitoring changes in ionic current arising from analyte interaction with the sensor pore, is a promising technology for multiplex sensing development. Outer Membrane Protein G (OmpG), a monomeric porin possessing seven functionalizable loops, has been reported as an effective sensing platform for selective protein detection. Using flow&#8208;cytometry to screen unfavorable constructs, we identified two OmpG nanopores with unique peptide motifs displayed in either loop 3 or 6, which also exhibited distinct analyte signals in single&#8208;channel current recordings. We exploited these loops concurrently to facilitate single&#8208;molecule multiplex protein detection in a mixture. We additionally report a strategy to increase sensor sensitivity via avidity motif display.

Outer Membrane Protein G (OmpG), a monomeric porin possessing seven functionalizable loops, has been reported as an effective sensing platform for selective protein detection. Using flow-cytometry to screen unfavorable constructs, we identified two OmpG nanopores with unique peptide motifs displayed in either loop 3 or 6, which also exhibited distinct analyte signals in single-channel current recordings. We exploited these loops concurrently to facilitate single-molecule multiplex protein detection in a mixture. We additionally report a strategy to increase sensor sensitivity via avidity motif display. These sensing schemes may be expanded to more sophisticated designs utilizing additional loops for increasing multiplicity and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Cobalt&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathodes through&#160;Oxygen Lattice Regulation by&#160;Two&#8208;phase Ru Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides is hindered by their dramatic capacity and voltage decay on cycling. This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping. A mechanistic transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal behaviour is found for the structural evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and the improvement mechanism of Ru doping is understood using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. The two&#8208;phase Ru doping improves the structural reversibility in the first cycle and restrains structural degradation during cycling by stabilizing oxygen (O2&#8208;) redox and reducing Mn reduction, thus enabling high structural stability, an extraordinarily stable voltage (decay rate &lt; 0.45 mV per cycle), and a high capacity&#8208;retention rate during long&#8208;term cycling. The understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationship of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 sheds light on the selective doping strategy and rational materials design for better&#8208;performance Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Up/Down Tuning of Poly(ionic liquid)s in Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally induced reversible up/down migration of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) was achieved for the first time in this study. Novel ATPSs were fabricated using azobenzene (Azo)&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified PILs, and their upper and lower phases could be easily tuned using the grafting degree (GD) of the Azo and Bn groups. Bn&#8208;PIL with higher GDBn could go up into the upper phase and Azo&#8208;PIL come down to the lower phase when the temperature increased (&gt;65 &#176;C); this behavior was reversed at lower temperatures. Moreover, a reversible two&#8208;phase/single&#8208;phase transition was realized under UV irradiation. Experimental and simulation results revealed that the difference in the hydration capacity between Bn&#8208;PIL and Azo&#8208;PIL accounted for their unique phase&#8208;separation behavior. A versatile platform for fabricating ATPSs with tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior can be realized based on our findings, which can broaden their applications in the fields of smart separation systems and functional material development.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Zwitterionic Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 1 Oligosaccharides Carrying Labile O&#8208;Acetyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly convergent and stereoselective total synthesis of zwitterionic Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharides, carrying labile O&#8208;acetyl esters, is described. Structural studies show the nonasaccharide to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure in which the acetyl groups decorating the periphery stabilize the structure.







Abstract
We herein report the first total synthesis of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharide, a unique zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide carrying labile O&#8208;acetyl esters. The target oligosaccharides, featuring rare &#945;&#8208;2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy galactose (AAT) and &#945;&#8208;galacturonic acids, were assembled up to the 9&#8208;mer level, in a highly stereoselective manner using trisaccharide building blocks. The lability of the O&#8208;acetyl esters imposed a careful deprotection scheme to prevent migration and hydrolysis. The migration was investigated in detail at various pD values using NMR spectroscopy, to show that migration and hydrolysis of the C&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl esters readily takes place under neutral conditions. Structural investigation showed the oligomers to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure with the acetyl esters exposed on the periphery of the helix in close proximity of the neighboring AAT residues, thereby imposing conformational restrictions on the AAT&#945;1&#8208;4GalA(3OAc) glycosidic linkages, supporting the helical shape of the polysaccharide, that has been proposed to be critical for its unique biological activity.

         <title>Synthesis of a Systematic 64&#8208;Membered Heparan Sulfate Tetrasaccharide Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 64 heparan sulfate tetrasaccharides containing all possible arrangements of 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 6&#8208;O&#8208; and N&#8208;sulfation with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone was successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This library enabled the determination of heparan sulfate structures for strong binding with fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 but weak binding to platelet factor&#8208;4.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) has multifaceted biological activities. To date, no libraries of HS oligosaccharides bearing systematically varied sulfation structures are available owing to the challenges in synthesizing a large number of HS oligosaccharides. To overcome the obstacles and expedite the synthesis, a divergent approach was designed, where 64 HS tetrasaccharides covering all possible structures of 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 6&#8208;O&#8208; and N&#8208;sulfation with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone were successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This extensive library helped identify the structural requirements for HS sequences to have strong fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 binding but a weak affinity for platelet factor&#8208;4. Such a strategy to separate out these two interactions could lead to new HS&#8208;based potential therapeutics without the dangerous adverse effect of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia.

         <title>Tailored Tolane&#8208;Perfluorotolane Assembly as Supramolecular Base Pair Replacement in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar &#960;&#8208;interactions and preferential stacking were observed by attaching tolane and perfluorotolanes as nucleobase surrogates to acyclic backbone replacements in an otherwise unmodified DNA duplex. The butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) was identified as privileged scaffold for exploiting the supramolecular arene&#8208;fluoroarene recognition in DNA.







Abstract
Arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions offer outstanding possibilities for engineering of supramolecular systems, including nucleic acids. Here, we implement the tolane&#8208;perfluorotolane interaction as base pair replacement in DNA. Tolane (THH) and perfluorotolane (TFF) moieties were connected to acyclic backbone units, comprising glycol nucleic acid (GNA) or butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) building blocks, that were incorporated via phosphoramidite chemistry at opposite positions in a DNA duplex. Thermodynamic analyses by UV thermal melting revealed a compelling stabilization by THH/TFF heteropairs only when connected to the BuNA backbone, but not with the shorter GNA linker. Detailed NMR studies confirmed the preference of the BuNA backbone for enhanced polar &#960;&#8208;stacking. This work defines how orthogonal supramolecular interactions can be tailored by small constitutional changes in the DNA backbone, and it inspires future studies of arene&#8208;fluoroarene&#8208;programmed assembly of DNA.

         <title>Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Anthrone&#8208;based Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By a simple stereoselective condensation with remote chirality control, axial chirality could be introduced to the symmetric anthrone backbones that comprise mostly sp2&#8208;hybridized carbons. The generated oxime ether functionality enables their transformation with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion via Beckmann rearrangement into enantioenriched dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Anthrones and analogues are structural cores shared by diverse pharmacologically active natural and synthetic compounds. The sp2&#8208;rich nature imposes inherent obstruction to introduce stereogenic element onto the tricyclic aromatic backbone. In our pursuit to expand the chemical space of axial chirality, a novel type of axially chiral anthrone&#8208;derived skeleton was discovered. This work establishes oxime ether as suitable functionality to furnish axial chirality on symmetric anthrone skeletons through stereoselective condensation of the carbonyl entity with long&#8208;range chirality control. The enantioenriched anthrones could be elaborated into dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles containing well&#8208;defined stereogenic center via Beckmann rearrangement with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion.

         <title>In Situ Observation of C&#8722;C Coupling and Step Poisoning During the Growth of Hydrocarbon Chains on Ni(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomistic mechanisms driving hydrocarbon chain growth on a nickel model catalyst were elucidated with a combination of surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ scanning tunneling microscopy. While the step edges of the catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for C&#8722;C coupling, this research demonstrates that polymerization occurs on the flat terrace sites.







Abstract
The synthesis of high&#8208;value fuels and plastics starting from small hydrocarbon molecules plays a central role in the current transition towards renewable energy. However, the detailed mechanisms driving the growth of hydrocarbon chains remain to a large extent unknown. Here we investigated the formation of hydrocarbon chains resulting from acetylene polymerization on a Ni(111) model catalyst surface. Exploiting X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy up to near&#8208;ambient pressures, the intermediate species and reaction products have been identified. Complementary in situ scanning tunneling microscopy observations shed light onto the C&#8722;C coupling mechanism. While the step edges of the metal catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for the C&#8722;C coupling, we showed that the polymerization occurs instead on the flat terraces of the metallic surface.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Reservoir Hydrogel Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Term Cycling Zn/PANI Batteries in Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn/PANI battery performance in wide temperature range is boosted by a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte with 3&#8197;M Zn(ClO4)2. The &#8722;SO3&#8722;H+ groups on the polymeric acid can not only act as the proton reservoir to inhibit PANI deprotonation and promote dual&#8208;ion storage, but also guide the Zn2+ deposition for dendrite suppression, thus resulting in excellent rate performance and ultra&#8208;high cycling stability in different temperatures.







Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising for next generation flexible devices owing to the high safety, yet still requiring better cycling stability and high capacities in wide temperature range. Herein, a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte (PAGE) with 3&#8197;M Zn(ClO4)2 was fabricated for high performance Zn/polyaniline (PANI) batteries. With PAGE, even at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C the Zn/Zn symmetrical battery can keep stable for more than 1&#8201;500&#8197;h under 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn/PANI battery can provide ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 79.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 for more than 70&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This can be mainly ascribed to the &#8722;SO3&#8722;H+ function group in PAGE. It can generate constant protons and guide the (002) plane formation to accelerate the PANI redox reaction kinetics, increase the specific capacity, and suppress the side reaction and dendrites. This proton&#8208;supplying strategy by polymeric acid hydrogel may further propel the development of high performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters: Development and Application to the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstratine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of tryptamine with &#945;&#8208;ketoesters in the presence of a catalytic amount of a chiral alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and 4&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid afforded the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and ee values. A concise seven&#8208;step asymmetric total synthesis of alstratine A, a cagelike hexacyclic indole alkaloid, was developed featuring this enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report herein an asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. In the presence of a catalytic amount of simple alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, reaction of tryptamines with methyl 2&#8208;oxoalkanoates afforded the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and ee values. A primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE=4.5) using C2&#8208;deteurium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that rearomatization through deprotonation of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion could be the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. A concise enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstratine A, a hexacyclic cagelike monoterpene indole alkaloid, featuring this reaction as a key step, was subsequently accomplished. Remeasurement of the [a]D value of the natural product indicates that natural alstratine A is dextrorotatory rather than levorotatory as it was initially reported in the isolation paper.

         <title>Origin and Acceleration of Insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S Reduction Catalysis in Ferromagnetic Atoms&#8208;based Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental origin and acceleration of insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic elements&#8208;based lithium&#8208;sulfur battery cathodes have been disclosed in this study. We show that the increase of spin polarization degree of metal&#8208;N4 sites enhances the metal&#8208;S interaction and accelerates the Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis at cathode interface, which provides practical opportunities towards high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis to mitigate the shuttle effect has emerged as an innovative paradigm for high&#8208;efficient lithium&#8208;sulfur battery cathodes, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts by offering high&#8208;density active sites to realize in situ reaction with solid Li2S2. However, the profound origin of diverse single&#8208;atom species on solid&#8208;solid sulfur reduction catalysis and modulation principles remains ambiguous. Here we disclose the fundamental origin of Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic elements&#8208;based single&#8208;atom materials to be from their spin density and magnetic moments. The experimental and theoretical studies disclose that the Fe&#8722;N4&#8208;based cathodes exhibit the fastest deposition kinetics of Li2S (226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and the lowest thermodynamic energy barriers (0.56&#8197;eV). We believe that the accelerated Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis enabled via spin polarization of ferromagnetic atoms provides practical opportunities towards long&#8208;life batteries.

We believe that the accelerated Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S reduction catalysis enabled via spin polarization of ferromagnetic atoms provides practical opportunities towards long-life batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Proton Transfer on Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Manganese Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between proton transfer and water oxidation performance has been established by constructing isomorphous manganese(II) phosphates. This proton hopping pathway in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O showed a much lower energy barrier than the direct diffusion pathway in KMnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The OER reaction mechanisms are proposed and proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been straightforwardly observed and understood.







Abstract
The effect of proton transfer on water oxidation has hardly been measurably established in heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, two isomorphous manganese phosphates (NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and KMnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) were designed to form an ideal platform to study the effect of proton transfer on water oxidation. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O has been proven to be solely responsible for its better activity. The differences of the proton transfer kinetics in the two materials indicate a fast proton hopping transfer process with a low activation energy in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. In addition, the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network can effectively promote the proton transfer between adjacent Mn sites and further stabilize the MnIII&#8722;OH intermediates. The faster proton transfer results in a higher proportion of zeroth&#8208;order in [H+] for OER. Thus, proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been measurably observed to bring detailed insights into the mechanism of water oxidation.

A palladium/PC&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions of amino&#8208;tethered 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene with aryl and alkenyl halides was developed. This method delivered various functionalized chiral hexahydroindoles in good yields with up to 98&#8201;% ee. The application of this reaction to the concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Lycorane was demonstrated.







Abstract
Chiral perhydroindoles are found in a number of natural products and biologically active compounds. Therefore, the development of new asymmetric methodology for rapid access to this core is of high importance. Herein, we reported a highly regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selective palladium/PC&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions of readily available amino tethered 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes with aryl and alkenyl halides, delivering various functionalized chiral hexahydroindoles in good yields with high enantioselectivity. The application of this reaction to the concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Lycorane was demonstrated. DFT computation results indicate that the difference in &#916;Edis of two migration insertion transition states determines the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis&#8208;based regioselective 1,4&#8208;fluorofunctionalization of trifluoromethyl substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes has been developed to access compact, highly functionalized products.

Abstract
A catalysis&#8208;based regioselective 1,4&#8208;fluorofunctionalization of trifluoromethyl substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes has been developed to access compact, highly functionalized products. The process allows E,Z&#8208;mixed dienes to be processed to a single E&#8208;alkene isomer, and leverages an inexpensive and operationally convenient I(I)/I(III) catalysis platform. The first example of catalytic 1,4&#8208;difluorination is disclosed and subsequently evolved to enable 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;difunctionalization, which allows &#948;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;alcohol and amine derivatives to be forged in a single operation. The protocol is compatible with a variety of nucleophiles including fluoride, nitriles, carboxylic acids, alcohols and even water thereby allowing highly functionalized products, with a stereocenter bearing both C(sp3)&#8722;F and C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 groups, to be generated rapidly. Scalability (up to 3&#8197;mmol), and facile post&#8208;reaction modifications are demonstrated to underscore the utility of the method in expanding organofluorine chemical space.

         <title>Durable High&#8208;Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Enabled by the Working&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Matching Palladium&#8208;Hydrogen Buffer Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with a Pd/C anode have excellent performance comparable to Pt/C. Pd acting as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent provides additional in situ hydrogen and absorbs infiltrated oxygen during fuel starvation to suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with Pt/C, the Pd/C anode greatly improves the durability of HT&#8208;PEMFCs during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation.







Abstract
The durability degradation during stack&#8208;operating conditions seriously deteriorates the lifetime and performance of the fuel cell. To alleviate the rapid potential rise and performance degradation, an anode design is proposed to match the working temperature of high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with the release temperature of hydrogen from palladium. The result is significantly enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity of Pd and superior performance of the Pd anode. Furthermore, Pd as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent layer in the anode can provide additional in situ hydrogen and absorb infiltrated oxygen during local fuel starvation to maintain HOR and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with the traditional Pt/C anode, the Pd/C also greatly improved HT&#8208;PEMFCs durability during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation. The storage/release of hydrogen provides innovative guidance for improving the durability of PEMFCs.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) show potential for a wide range of applications based on their unique characteristics, such as interpenetrated channels, low densities, high surface areas, and high chemical stabilities. In this Minireview, we summarize the strategies for the preparation of functional 3D COFs, including crystallization methods and functionalization pathways, and provide an overview of their potential applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with spatially periodic networks demonstrate significant advantages over their 2D counterparts, including enhanced specific surface areas, interconnected channels, and more sufficiently exposed active sites. Nevertheless, research on these materials has met an impasse due to serious problems in crystallization and stability, which must be solved for practical applications. In this Minireview, we first summarize some strategies for preparing functional 3D COFs, including crystallization techniques and functionalization methods. Hereafter, applications of these functional materials are presented, covering adsorption, separation, catalysis, fluorescence, sensing, and batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) show potential for a wide range of applications based on their unique characteristics, such as interpenetrated channels, low densities, high surface areas, and high chemical stabilities. In this Minireview, we summarize the strategies for the preparation of functional 3D COFs, including crystallization methods and functionalization pathways, and provide an overview of their potential applications.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with spatially periodic networks demonstrate significant advantages over their 2D counterparts, including enhanced specific surface areas, interconnected channels, and more sufficiently exposed active sites. Nevertheless, research on these materials has met an impasse due to serious problems in crystallization and stability, which must be solved for practical applications. In this Minireview, we first summarize some strategies for preparing functional 3D COFs, including crystallization techniques and functionalization methods. Hereafter, applications of these functional materials are presented, covering adsorption, separation, catalysis, fluorescence, sensing, and batteries. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for the development of 3D COFs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation Using Inter&#8208;Facet Edge Rich WO3 Arrays for Photoelectrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct 1&#8201;e&#8722; electron and indirect 2&#8201;e&#8722; electron transfer pathways for photoelectrochemical water oxidation are achieved using inter&#8208;facet edge (IEF) rich WO3 photoanode in the presence of CO32&#8722;, the total Faraday efficiencies of H2O2 and OH&#8901; productis exceed 90&#8201;%. Then, selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by in situ using the formed OH&#8901; delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of &#8776;768&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% selectivity.







Abstract
Water oxidation reaction leaves room to be improved in the development of various solar fuel productions, because of the kinetically sluggish 4&#8208;electron transfer process of oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, we realize reactive oxygen species (ROS), H2O2 and OH&#8901;, formations by water oxidation with total Faraday efficiencies of more than 90&#8201;% by using inter&#8208;facet edge (IFE) rich WO3 arrays in an electrolyte containing CO32&#8722;. Our results demonstrate that the IFE favors the adsorption of CO32&#8722; while reducing the adsorption energy of OH&#8901;, as well as suppresses surface hole accumulation by direct 1&#8208;electron and indirect 2&#8208;electron transfer pathways. Finally, we present selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by in situ using the formed OH&#8901;, which delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of &#8776;768&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% selectivity. This work offers a promising approach to tune or control the oxidation reaction in an aqueous solar fuel system towards high efficiency and value&#8208;added product.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Polycyclic Molecules via Ring Fusion for n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugation extension using ring fusion, intramolecular conformational lock, and deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level endow the resulting 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic molecules with a record&#8208;high &#956;C* of 10.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a high electron mobility of 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
The primary challenge for n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is to improve their electron mobilities and thus the key figure of merit &#956;C*. Nevertheless, few reports in OECTs have specially proposed to address this issue. Herein, we report a 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system consisting of the core of naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin dimer and the terminal moieties of rhodanine, which features intramolecular noncovalent interactions, high &#960;&#8208;delocalization and strong electron&#8208;deficient characteristics. We find that this extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using the ring fusion strategy displays improved electron mobilities up to 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared to our previously reported small molecule gNR, and thereby leads to a remarkable &#956;C* of 10.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type OECTs, which is the highest value reported to date for small&#8208;molecule OECTs. This work highlights the importance of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension in polycyclic&#8208;fused molecules for enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OECTs.

         <title>Antiaromatic Sapphyrin Isomer: Transformation into Contracted Porphyrinoids with Variable Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer was successfully synthesized based on the unique cyclization at a terminal N&#8208;confused pyrrole unit of pentapyrrane. The specific reactivity associated with the antiaromaticity and confused pyrrole provides chances for constructing novel porphyrinoids with tunable aromaticity.







Abstract
Sapphyrin is a pentapyrrolic expanded porphyrin with a 22&#960; aromatic character. Herein, we report the synthesis of a 20&#960; antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer 1 by oxidative cyclization of a pentapyrrane precursor P5 with a terminal &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole. The resulting isomer 1, containing a mis&#8208;linked bipyrrole unit in the skeleton, exhibits a reactivity for further oxidation due to the distinct antiaromatic electronic structure, affording a fused macrocycle 2, possessing a spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing [5.6.5.6]&#8208;tetracyclic structure. Subsequent treatment with an acid afforded a weakly aromatic pyrrolone&#8208;appended N&#8208;confused corrole 3, and thermal fusion gave a [5.6.5.7]&#8208;tetracyclic&#8208;ring&#8208;embedded 14&#960; aromatic triphyrin(2.1.1) analog 4. The cyclization at the mis&#8208;linked pyrrole moiety of P5 played a crucial role in synthesizing the antiaromatic porphyrinoid susceptible to facile transformation to novel porphyrinoids with variable aromaticity.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation and Engineering of Sesterviolene Synthase from Streptomyces violens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sesterviolene synthase from Streptomyces violarus is the second bacterial sesterterpene synthase to be described. The enzyme generates one main and several side products whose mechanisms of formation were studied in isotopic labelling experiments and through DFT calculations. Enzyme engineering allowed isolation and structural characterisation of the side products and gave access to the main product in sufficient quantity to study its chemistry.







Abstract
The sesterviolene synthase from Streptomyces violens was identified and represents the second known sesterterpene synthase from bacteria. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed that provided detailed insight into its complex cyclisation mechanism. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis gave access to a high&#8208;yielding enzyme variant that provided six additional minor products and the main product in sufficient quantities to study its chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Diels&#8211;Alder &#8220;Click&#8221; Strategy to Access Mechanically Aligned Main&#8208;Chain Liquid Crystal Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled two&#8208;stage polymerization of mechanically aligned liquid crystal networks (LCNs) has been developed that relies on a fast cyclopentadiene maleimide step&#8208;growth polymerization with a latent maleimide being generated in situ upon heating. This approach allows the introduction of nucleophile&#8208; or radical&#8208;sensitive molecules into light&#8208;actuated LCNs, and the potential for larger sampler geometries.







Abstract
Aligned liquid crystal polymers are materials of interest for electronic, optic, biological and soft robotic applications. The manufacturing and processing of these materials have been widely explored with mechanical alignment establishing itself as a preferred method due to its ease of use and widespread applicability. However, the fundamental chemistry behind the required two&#8208;step polymerization for mechanical alignment has limitations in both fabrication and substrate compatibility. In this work we introduce a new protection&#8208;deprotection approach utilizing a two&#8208;stage Diels&#8211;Alder cyclopentadiene&#8208;maleimide step&#8208;growth polymerization to enable mild yet efficient, fast, controlled, reproducible and user&#8208;friendly polymerizations, broadening the scope of liquid crystal systems. Thorough characterization of the films by DSC, DMA, POM and WAXD show the successful synthesis of a uniaxially aligned liquid crystal network with thermomechanical actuation abilities.

         <title>Efficient Multiple Domain Ligation for Proteins Using Asparaginyl Endopeptidase by Selection of Appropriate Ligation Sites Based on Steric Hindrance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was experimentally verified in an enzymatic domain&#8208;ligation that ligation efficiency depends on ligation sites. Subsequently, a site&#8208;dependent ligation&#8208;potential index was computationally developed, considering the steric hindrance of ligation site. Referring to this index, the three&#8208;domains ligation of ER&#8208;60 was succeeded. This index is applicable to identify feasible ligation sites.







Abstract
Three domain fragments of a multi&#8208;domain protein, ER&#8208;60, were ligated in two short linker regions using asparaginyl endopeptidase not involving denaturation. To identify appropriate ligation sites, by selecting several potential ligation sites with fewer mutations around two short linker regions, their ligation efficiencies and the functions of the ligated ER&#8208;60s were examined experimentally. To evaluate the dependence of ligation efficiencies on the ligation sites computationally, steric hinderances around the sites for the ligation were calculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Utilizing the steric hindrance, a site&#8208;dependent ligation potential index was introduced as reproducing the experimental ligation efficiency. Referring to this index, the reconstruction of ER&#8208;60 was succeeded by the ligation of the three domains for the first time. In addition, the new ligation potential index well&#8208;worked for application to other domain ligations. Therefore, the index may serve as a more time&#8208;effective tool for multi&#8208;site ligations.

         <title>CO2 Induces Symmetry Breaking in Layered Dipeptide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking manner of monomolecular layers in dipeptide crystals has been manipulated by utilizing CO2 to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. As a result, the dipeptide crystal symmetry was broken and the piezoelectricity greatly improved.







Abstract
Control of symmetry breaking of materials provides large opportunities to regulate their properties and functions. Herein, we report breaking the symmetry of layered dipeptide crystals by utilizing CO2 to induce the adjacent monomolecular layers to stack from the opposite to the same direction. The role of CO2 is to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. Further, the dipeptide crystals exhibit far superior piezoelectricity after symmetry breaking and the piezoelectric voltage generated from the dipeptide&#8208;based generators becomes more than 500&#8201;% higher than before. This work reveals a potential route to engineer structures and properties of layered materials and provides a deep insight into the control of non&#8208;covalent interactions.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Iron(II) Oxide Sites Directly Responsible for Preferential Carbon Monoxide Oxidation at Ambient Temperature: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed a linear correlation between the amount of oxidic Fe2+ and ambient temperature activity of Pt&#8722;FeOx preferential carbon monoxide oxidation catalysts. Hydrogen prereduction temperature and pressure determines the amount of active Fe2+ sites for alumina&#8208; and silica&#8208;supported Pt&#8722;Fe catalysts. Catalyst deactivation is linked with the oxidation of these sites.







Abstract
Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identified that the concentration of Fe2+ species in the working state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8722;FeOx catalysts quantitatively correlates to their preferential carbon monoxide oxidation steady&#8208;state reaction rate at ambient temperature. Deactivation of such catalysts with time on stream originates from irreversible oxidation of active Fe2+ sites. The active Fe2+ species are presumably Fe+2O&#8722;2 clusters in contact with platinum nanoparticles; they coexist with spectator trivalent oxidic iron (Fe3+) and metallic iron (Fe0) partially alloyed with platinum. The concentration of active sites and, therefore, the catalyst activity strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions. Fe2+ is the resting state of the active sites in the preferential carbon monoxide oxidation cycle.

         <title>Dearomatization of Biaryls through Polarity Mismatched Radical Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomatization reactions involving radical cyclizations can facilitate the synthesis of complex polycyclic systems that find applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. Here we employ redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis to affect a radical spirocyclization that transforms biaryls into spirocyclic cyclohexadienones under mild reaction conditions. In a departure from previously reported methods, our work demonstrates the polarity mismatched addition of a nucleophilic radical to an electron rich arene, and allows the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienone isomers with broad functional group tolerance. By transforming biaryls into spirocycles, our methodology accesses underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space, and provides an efficient means of creating quaternary spirocenters that we apply to the first synthesis of the cytotoxic plant metabolite denobilone A.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To solve the problems such as the dissolution and the poor conductivity of organic small molecule electrode materials, we construct &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers as lithium storage materials. It exhibits an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfers, while the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and the laminar structure inside the crystal ensure fast electron transport and lithium ion diffusion, resulting in excellent rate performance (505.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles). The interaction of Ni&#8208;DHBQ with the binder CMC synergistically inhibits its dissolution and anchors the Ni atoms, thus exhibiting excellent cycling stability (650.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles). This work provides insight into the mechanism of lithium storage in &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers and the synergistic effect of CMC, which will contribute to the molecular design and commercial application of organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conformational Restriction Strategy for the Control of CRISPR/Cas Gene Editing with Photoactivatable Guide RNAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CRISPR/Cas system is one of the most powerful tools for gene editing. However, approaches for precise control of genome editing and regulatory events are still desirable. Here, we report a spatiotemporal and efficient control of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208; and Cas12a&#8208;mediated editing with conformational restricted gRNAs. This approach relied on only two or three pre&#8208;installed photo&#8208;labile substituents followed by an intramolecular cyclization, representing a robust synthetic method in comparison to the heavily modified linear gRNAs which often required extensive screening and time&#8208;consuming optimization. The tactic could direct precise cleavage of GFP and VEGFA within a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakage in live cells. We also achieved light&#8208;mediated MSTN gene editing in embryos, wherein a new bow&#8208;knot&#8208;type gRNA was constructed with excellent OFF/ON switch efficiency. Overall, our work provides a significantly new strategy in CRISPR/Cas editing with modified circular guide RNAs to precisely manipulate where and when genes are edited.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;fueled transformations of a dynamic cage&#8208;based molecular system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a chemical equilibrium, the formation of high&#8208;energy species &#8211; in a closed system &#8211; is inefficient due to microscopic reversibility. Here, we demonstrate how this restriction can be circumvented by coupling a dynamic equilibrium to a light&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an azobenzene imine cage. The stable E&#8208;cage resists intermolecular imine exchange reactions that would &#8220;open&#8221; it. Upon switching, the strained Z&#8208;cage isomers undergo imine exchange spontaneously, thus opening the cage. Subsequent isomerization of the Z&#8208;open compounds yields a high&#8208;energy, kinetically trapped E&#8208;open species, which cannot be efficiently obtained from the initial E&#8208;cage, thus shifting an imine equilibrium energetically uphill in a closed system. Upon heating, the nucleophile is displaced back into solution and an opening/closing cycle is completed by regenerating the stable all&#8208;E&#8208;cage. Using this principle, a light&#8208;induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation is performed by the addition of a ditopic aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparative&#8208;Scale Biocatalytic Oxygenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles with a Lyophilized Peroxygenase Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lyophilized preparation of an unspecific peroxygenase variant from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H) is a highly effective catalyst for the oxygenation of a diverse range of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. Scalable biocatalytic oxygenations (27 preparative examples, &#8776;100 mgs scale) have been developed across a wide range of substrates, including alkyl pyridines, bicyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and indoles. H2O2 is the only stoichiometric oxidant needed, without auxiliary electron transport proteins, which is key to the practicality of the method. Reaction outcomes can be altered depending on whether hydrogen peroxide was delivered by syringe pump or through in situ generation using an alcohol oxidase from Pichia pastoris (PpAOX) and methanol as a co&#8208;substrate. Good synthetic yields (up to 84%), regioselectivity and enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) were observed in some cases, highlighting the promise of UPOs as practical, versatile and scalable oxygenation biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable latency of hydrosilylation catalyst by ligand density on nanoparticle supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tethering of inorganic particle surfaces with organic ligands serves as a common technique for heterogenizing organometallic catalysts. We describe how the coordination of molecular platinum to high density norbornene&#8208;functionalized silica nanoparticles results in an unexpected latency of the catalytic activity (2% conversion after 60 min) in hydrosilylation reactions when compared to an identical reaction in which the norbornene is not tethered (97% conversion after 60 min). Performing the hydrosilylation at elevated temperature (70 &#176;C) suppresses this activity delay, suggesting the usefulness of this technique towards temperature&#8208;triggered catalysis. We demonstrate that this latency is related to the density of the ligand on the inorganic particle surface, the chemical structure of the norbornene, and the topology of the silica nanoparticles. We also establish the benefit of this latency effect for the triggered curing of silicone elastomers. Overall, our work establishes the non&#8208;innocent role of inorganic supports when functionalized with organometallic complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric Oligo(Phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Different Orientation of Imine Bonds and Distinct Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively studied in photocatalysis because of their easy synthesis and excellent crystallinity. The effect of imine bond orientation on the photocatalytic properties of COFs, however, is still rarely studied. In this work, we reported two novel COFs with different orientations of imine bonds using oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties. The COFs showed similar structures but great differences in photoelectric properties. COF&#8208;932 demonstrated superior hydrogen evolution performance than COF&#8208;923 when triethanolamine was used as the sacrificial agent. Interestingly, the use of ascorbic acid led to the protonation of COFs, further altering the direction of electron transfer. The photocatalytic performances were increased to 23.4 and 0.73 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for protonated COF&#8208;923 and COF&#8208;932, respectively. This work provides a clear strategy for the design of imine&#8208;linked COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts and advances the development of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Molecular Cage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Enzymatic Photocyclization of Alkynylaniline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocyclization of alkynylanilines catalyzed by an aggregated PtII&#8208;based octahedral cage has been shown to mimic bio&#8208;enzyme catalysis by aggregated biological macromolecules. The aggregated supramolecular species exhibits a higher photocatalytic efficiency than dispersed metal&#8208;organic cages without aggregation.







Abstract
Enzymes facilitate chemical conversions through the collective activity of aggregated components, but the marriage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with molecular containers to emulate enzymatic conversion remains challenging. Herein, we report a new approach to construct a PtII&#8208;based octahedral cage with AIE characteristics for the photocyclization of alkynylaniline by restricting the rotation of the pendant phenyl rings peripheral to the PtII corner. With the presence of water, the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions involving the triphenylphosphine fragments resulted in aggregation of the molecular cages into spherical particles and significantly enhanced the PtII&#8208;based luminescence. The kinetically inert Pt&#8208;NP chelator, with highly differentiated redox potentials in the ground and excited states, and the efficient coordination activation of the platinum corner facilitated excellent catalysis of the photocyclization of alkynylaniline. The enzymatic kinetics and the advantages of binding and activating substrates in an aqueous medium provide a new avenue to develop mimics for efficient photosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The photocyclization of alkynylanilines catalyzed by an aggregated Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-based octahedral cage has been shown to mimic bio-enzyme catalysis by aggregated biological macromolecules. The aggregated supramolecular species exhibits a higher photocatalytic efficiency than dispersed metal-organic cages without aggregation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymes facilitate chemical conversions through the collective activity of aggregated components, but the marriage of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with molecular containers to emulate enzymatic conversion remains challenging. Herein, we report a new approach to construct a Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-based octahedral cage with AIE characteristics for the photocyclization of alkynylaniline by restricting the rotation of the pendant phenyl rings peripheral to the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; corner. With the presence of water, the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions involving the triphenylphosphine fragments resulted in aggregation of the molecular cages into spherical particles and significantly enhanced the Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-based luminescence. The kinetically inert Pt-NP chelator, with highly differentiated redox potentials in the ground and excited states, and the efficient coordination activation of the platinum corner facilitated excellent catalysis of the photocyclization of alkynylaniline. The enzymatic kinetics and the advantages of binding and activating substrates in an aqueous medium provide a new avenue to develop mimics for efficient photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein as a Target for Metallo&#8208;Anti&#8208;Neurodegenerative Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuIII complex NAMI&#8208;A is activated by hydrolysis and then reacts with specific amino acids in the abundant brain protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein, preventing and disassembling &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, abolishing toxicity toward neuronal cells, and mitigating neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a model of Parkinson's. Since NAMI&#8208;A has a pharmaceutically&#8208;acceptable profile, it has potential for use in treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.







Abstract
The unique thermodynamic and kinetic coordination chemistry of ruthenium allows it to modulate key adverse aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) associated with Parkinson's disease. We show that the low&#8208;toxic RuIII complex trans&#8208;[ImH][RuCl4(Me2SO)(Im)] (NAMI&#8208;A) has dual inhibitory effects on both aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;syn with submicromolar affinity, and disassembles pre&#8208;formed fibrils. NAMI&#8208;A abolishes the cytotoxicity of &#945;&#8208;syn towards neuronal cells and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's. Multinuclear NMR and MS analyses show that NAMI&#8208;A binds to residues involved in protein aggregation and membrane binding. NMR studies reveal the key steps in pro&#8208;drug activation and the effect of activated NAMI&#8208;A species on protein folding. Our findings provide a new basis for designing ruthenium complexes which could mitigate &#945;&#8208;syn&#8208;induced Parkinson's pathology differently from organic agents.

         <title>Reversible Switching CuII/CuI Single Sites Catalyze High&#8208;rate and Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, reversible redox&#8208;switching CuII/CuI single sites confined in Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets were used in the CO2 photoreduction to CO.







Abstract
Herein, we first design a model of reversible redox&#8208;switching metal&#8211;organic framework single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets, where the abundant metal single sites benefit for highly selective CO2 reduction, while the reversible redox&#8208;switching metal sites can effectively activate CO2 molecules. Taking the synthetic Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra unravel the reversible switching CuII/CuI single sites initially accept photoexcited electrons and then donate them to CO2 molecules, which favors the rate&#8208;liming activation into CO2&#948;&#8722;, verified by in situ FTIR spectra and Gibbs free energy calculations. As an outcome, Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets achieve near 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CO with a high rate of 860&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 without any sacrifice reagent or photosensitizer, where both the activity and selectivity outperform previously reported photocatalysts evaluated under similar conditions.

         <title>In Vivo Biocatalytic Cascades Featuring an Artificial&#8208;Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed New&#8208;to&#8208;Nature Reaction
</title>

         <dc:description>
We report in vivo biocatalytic cascade reactions comprising a combination of canonical enzyme&#8208;catalysed reactions with an artificial&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalysed new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The artificial enzyme contains a genetically encoded unnatural catalytic residue, which catalyses the formation of a hydrazone product from biosynthetically produced benzaldehydes in E. coli.







Abstract
Artificial enzymes utilizing the genetically encoded non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid p&#8208;aminophenylalanine (pAF) as a catalytic residue are able to react with carbonyl compounds through an iminium ion mechanism to promote reactions that have no equivalent in nature. Herein, we report an in vivo biocatalytic cascade that is augmented with such an artificial enzyme&#8208;catalysed new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The artificial enzyme in this study is a pAF&#8208;containing evolved variant of the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator, designated LmrR_V15pAF_RMH, which efficiently converts benzaldehyde derivatives produced in vivo into the corresponding hydrazone products inside E. coli cells. These in vivo biocatalytic cascades comprising an artificial&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalysed reaction are an important step towards achieving a hybrid metabolism.

         <title>Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Design through Oxide Support Modulation for Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Ethylene Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the direct metal coordination environment in single&#8208;atom catalysts, via adjustment of the oxide surface chemistry, is a powerful strategy towards reactivity modulation. An energetically facile depletion of surface oxygen on a Rh1/SnO2 catalyst unlocks an exceptional performance in the gas&#8208;phase hydroformylation of ethylene with syngas, hitherto exclusive of molecular catalysts operating in liquid environments.







Abstract
A frontier challenge in single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis is the design of fully inorganic sites capable of emulating the high reaction selectivity traditionally exclusive of organometallic counterparts in homogeneous catalysis. Modulating the direct coordination environment in SA sites, via the exploitation of the oxide support's surface chemistry, stands as a powerful albeit underexplored strategy. We report that isolated Rh atoms stabilized on oxygen&#8208;defective SnO2 uniquely unite excellent TOF with essentially full selectivity in the gas&#8208;phase hydroformylation of ethylene, inhibiting the thermodynamically favored olefin hydrogenation. Density Functional Theory calculations and surface characterization suggest that substantial depletion of the catalyst surface in lattice oxygen, energetically facile on SnO2, is key to unlock a high coordination pliability at the mononuclear Rh centers, leading to an exceptional performance which is on par with that of molecular catalysts in liquid media.

         <title>Encapsulating Metal Nanoparticles into a Layered Zeolite Precursor with Surface Silanol Nests Enhances Sintering Resistance
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
IPC&#8208;1P, a layered zeolite precursor with a relatively high density of surface silanols can be swollen using docosyltrimethylammonium hydroxide and functionalized with ultra&#8208;small Rh nanoparticles. The resulting mesoporous zeolitic material Rh@IPC_C22 has a high layer disordering without microporosity. In situ heating STEM imaging and DFT simulations show strong metal&#8208;silanol interactions stabilizing Rh nanoparticles against thermal sintering.







Abstract
Supported metal nanoparticles are used as heterogeneous catalysts but often deactivated due to sintering at high temperatures. Confining metal species into a porous matrix reduces sintering, yet supports rarely provide additional stabilization. Here, we used the silanol&#8208;rich layered zeolite IPC&#8208;1P to stabilize ultra&#8208;small Rh nanoparticles. By adjusting the IPC&#8208;1P interlayer space through swelling, we prepared various architectures, including microporous and disordered mesoporous. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed that Rh nanoparticles are resistant to sintering at high temperature (750&#8201;&#176;C, 6&#8197;hrs). Rh clusters strongly bind to surface silanol quadruplets at IPC&#8208;1P layers by hydrogen transfer to clusters, while high silanol density hinders their migration based on density functional theory calculations.

&lt;p&gt;IPC-1P, a layered zeolite precursor with a relatively high density of surface silanols can be swollen using docosyltrimethylammonium hydroxide and functionalized with ultra-small Rh nanoparticles. The resulting mesoporous zeolitic material Rh@IPC_C22 has a high layer disordering without microporosity. In situ heating STEM imaging and DFT simulations show strong metal-silanol interactions stabilizing Rh nanoparticles against thermal sintering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported metal nanoparticles are used as heterogeneous catalysts but often deactivated due to sintering at high temperatures. Confining metal species into a porous matrix reduces sintering, yet supports rarely provide additional stabilization. Here, we used the silanol-rich layered zeolite IPC-1P to stabilize ultra-small Rh nanoparticles. By adjusting the IPC-1P interlayer space through swelling, we prepared various architectures, including microporous and disordered mesoporous. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed that Rh nanoparticles are resistant to sintering at high temperature (750&#8201;&#176;C, 6&#8197;hrs). Rh clusters strongly bind to surface silanol quadruplets at IPC-1P layers by hydrogen transfer to clusters, while high silanol density hinders their migration based on density functional theory calculations. Ultimately, combining swelling with long-chain surfactant and utilizing metal-silanol interactions resulted in a novel, catalytically active material&#8212;Rh@IPC_C22.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imaging Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Detachment of Mass&#8208;Selected Chiral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;resolved Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD) is demonstrated in the photoelectron spectroscopy of mass&#8208;selected deprotonated 1&#8208;indanol anionic ([Ind&#8208;H]&#8722;) enantiomers. A unique PECD signature is observed for several isomers and detachment channels of [Ind&#8208;H]&#8722;. This work supports the use of anions for future analytical methods of enantiomeric discrimination, and allows for insight into the influence of short&#8208;range interactions on PECD.







Abstract
Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD) is a forward&#8208;backward asymmetry in the photoemission from a non&#8208;racemic sample induced by circularly polarized light. PECD spectroscopy has potential analytical advantages for chiral discrimination over other chiroptical methods due to its increased sensitivity to the chiral potential of the molecule. The use of anions for PECD spectroscopy allows for mass&#8208;selectivity and provides a path to simple experimental schemes that employ table&#8208;top light sources. Evidence of PECD for anions is limited, and insight into the forces that govern PECD electron dynamics in photodetachment is absent. Here, we demonstrate a PECD effect in the photodetachment of mass&#8208;selected deprotonated 1&#8208;indanol anions. By utilizing velocity map imaging photoelectron spectroscopy with a tunable light source, we determine the energy&#8208;resolved PECD over a wide range of photon energies. The observed PECD reaches up to 11&#8201;%, similar to what has been measured for neutral species.

         <title>The Marriage of Sierpi&#324;ski Triangles and Platonic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful multicomponent self&#8208;assembly strategy has been developed that allows access to gorgeous 3D architectures with large cavities and high complexity. This approach has led to the synthesis of a Sierpi&#324;ski tetrahedron and a Sierpi&#324;ski octahedron with Sierpi&#324;ski triangles as the panels. These two discrete complexes, with molecular weights up to 55&#8197;kDa and diameters up to 7.4&#8197;nm, were formed in near&#8208;quantitative yields.







Abstract
Fractal structures with self&#8208;similarity are of fundamental importance in the fields of aesthetic, chemistry and mathematics. Here, by taking advantage of constructs the rational geometry&#8208;directed precursor design, we report the construction of two fascinating Platonic solids, the Sierpi&#324;ski tetrahedron ST&#8208;T and the Sierpi&#324;ski octahedron ST&#8208;O, in which each possesses a fractal Sierpi&#324;ski triangle on their independent faces. These two discrete complexes are formed in near&#8208;quantitative yield from the multi&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly of truncated Sierpi&#324;ski triangular kernel L1 with tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;based hexatopic and anthracene&#8208;based tetratopic terpyridine ligands (L3 and L4) in the presence of metal ions, respectively. The enhanced stabilities of the 3D discrete structures were investigated by gradient tandem mass spectrometry (gMS2). This work provides new constructs for the imitation of complex virus assemblies and for the molecular encapsulation of giant guest molecules.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Activation Enabled by a Single, Vinylogous Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes bearing only a single, vinylogous acceptor moiety is presented. The system is capable of cycloadditions through Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acid catalysis with numerous reagents: aldehydes, ketones, thioketones, nitriles, naphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols, cyclopropanes, nitrones and isobenzofurans. The mechanism was explored in detail by kinetic and mechanistic experiments.







Abstract
A novel class of highly activated donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes bearing only a single, vinylogous acceptor is presented. These strained moieties readily undergo cycloadditions with aldehydes, ketones, thioketones, nitriles, naphth&#8208;2&#8208;ols and various other substrates to yield the corresponding carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Diastereocontrol can be achieved through the choice of catalyst (Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acid). The formation of tetrahydrofurans was shown to be highly enantiospecific when chiral cyclopropanes are employed. A series of mechanistic and kinetic experiments was conducted to elucidate a plausible catalytic cycle and to rationalize the stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Bioinspired Gradient Stretchable Aerogels for Ultrabroad&#8208;Range&#8208;Response Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Wearable Electronics and High&#8208;Efficient Separators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient, stretchable and superelastic reduced graphene oxide/polyurethane nanocomposite aerogels have been achieved by a sol&#8208;gel/hot pressing/freeze casting/ambient pressure drying strategy. The gradient aerogels can be used for high&#8208;efficient separators and wearable electronics with an ultrabroad detection range of 1&#8197;Pa&#8211;12.6&#8197;MPa and ultrahigh fatigue resistance, showing great potentials in high&#8208;performance sensors and separators.







Abstract
Broad&#8208;range&#8208;response pressure&#8208;sensitive wearable electronics are urgently needed but their preparation remains a challenge. Herein, we report unprecedented bioinspired wearable electronics based on stretchable and superelastic reduced graphene oxide/polyurethane nanocomposite aerogels with gradient porous structures by a sol&#8208;gel/hot pressing/freeze casting/ambient pressure drying strategy. The gradient structure with a hot&#8208;pressed layer promotes strain transfer and resistance variation under high pressures, leading to an ultrabroad detection range of 1&#8197;Pa&#8211;12.6&#8197;MPa, one of the broadest ranges ever reported. They can withstand 10&#8201;000 compression cycles under 1&#8197;MPa, which can't be achieved by traditional flexible pressure sensors. They can be applied for broad&#8208;range&#8208;response electronic skins and monitoring various physical signals/motions and ultrahigh pressures of automobile tires. Moreover, the gradient aerogels can be used as high&#8208;efficient gradient separators for water purification.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first method for highly enantioselective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed Heyns rearrangement reactions, featuring low catalyst loadings, high yields, high enantioselectivities, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and broad substrate scope has been developed. The method is efficient, delivering various chiral amines, including some biologically active molecules.







Abstract
Herein we report the first method for highly enantioselective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed Heyns rearrangements. These reactions, catalyzed by a chiral spiro phosphoric acid, afforded synthetically valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoketones which cannot be obtained by means of previously reported Heyns rearrangement methods. This method features low catalyst loadings, high yields and high enantioselectivities, making these reactions highly practical. We used the method to efficiently synthesize various chiral amines, including some biologically active molecules. We experimentally proved that these acid&#8208;catalyzed Heyns rearrangements proceeded via a proton&#8208;transfer process involving an enol intermediate and the stereocontrol was realized during the proton&#8208;transfer step.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the first method for highly enantioselective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed Heyns rearrangements. These reactions, catalyzed by a chiral spiro phosphoric acid, afforded synthetically valuable chiral &#945;-aryl-&#945;-aminoketones which cannot be obtained by means of previously reported Heyns rearrangement methods. This method features low catalyst loadings, high yields and high enantioselectivities, making these reactions highly practical. We used the method to efficiently synthesize various chiral amines, including some biologically active molecules. We experimentally proved that these acid-catalyzed Heyns rearrangements proceeded via a proton-transfer process involving an enol intermediate and the stereocontrol was realized during the proton-transfer step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Strategy for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Sulfoglycolipids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis To Elucidate the Structure and Immunomodulatory Property Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) was developed. The strategy features a suite of asymmetrically protected trehaloses for acylation and sulfation. A practical synthetic route was explored for the preparation of polydeoxypropionate fatty acids, which together with the trehaloses enabled the synthesis of different classes of SGLs for immunological studies.







Abstract
We developed a versatile asymmetric strategy to synthesize different classes of sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The strategy features the use of asymmetrically protected trehaloses, which were acquired from the glycosylation of TMS &#945;&#8208;glucosyl acceptors with benzylidene&#8208;protected thioglucosyl donors. The positions of the protecting groups at the donors and acceptors can be fine&#8208;tuned to obtain different protecting&#8208;group patterns, which is crucial for regioselective acylation and sulfation. In addition, a chemoenzymatic strategy was established to prepare the polymethylated fatty acid building blocks. The strategy employs inexpensive lipase as a desymmetrization agent in the preparation of the starting substrate and readily available chiral oxazolidinone as a chirality&#8208;controlling agent in the construction of the polymethylated fatty acids. A subsequent investigation on the immunomodulatory properties of each class of SGLs showed how the structures of SGLs impact the host innate immunity response.

         <title>The Effect of Molecular Conformations and Simulated &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; in Phenothiazine Derivatives on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has drawn great attention for their wide potential applications. Besides single&#8208;component and host&#8208;guest doping systems, the self&#8208;doping with same molecule but different conformations in one state is also a possible way to construct RTP materials, regardless of its rare investigation. In this work, twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied, with the aim to deeply understand the self&#8208;doping effect on the corresponding RTP property. While the phenothiazine derivatives with quasi&#8208;axial (ax) conformation presented better RTP performance in aggregated state, the quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) ones were better in isolated state. Accordingly, the much promoted RTP performance was achieved in the stimulated self&#8208;doping state with ax&#8208;conformer as host and eq&#8208;one as guest, demonstrating the significant influence of self&#8208;doping on RTP effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;La&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Binary Organic Solar Cells with 18.82% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely used hole transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs), but its acidity severely reduces the stability of devices. Until now, very few HTLs were developed to replace PEDOT:PSS toward stable and high&#8208;performance OSCs. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;lanthanum (Co&#8208;La) inorganic system was reported as HTL to show a high conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 18.82%, which is among the top PCEs in binary OSCs. Since electron&#8208;rich outer shell of La atom can interact with Co atom to form charge transfer complex, the work function and conductivity of the Co&#8208;La system could be simultaneously enhanced compared to Co or La&#8208;based HTLs. This Co&#8208;La system could also be applied into other OSCs to show high performance . All these results demonstrate that binary Co&#8208;La systems as HTL can efficiently tackle the issue in hole transporting and show powerful application in OSCs to replace PEDOT:PSS.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Anchoring of Hydrogels through Superwetting&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Density Interfacial Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong adhesion of hydrogels on solids plays an important role in stable working for various practical applications. However, current hydrogel adhesion suffers from poor interfacial bonding with solid surfaces. Here, we propose a general superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to robustly anchor hydrogels onto solids by forming high&#8208;density interfacial covalent bonds. The key of our strategy is to make the initiator fully contact solid surfaces via a superwetting way for enhancing the interfacial grafting efficiency. The designed anchored hydrogels show strong bulk failure with a high breaking strength of ~ 1.37 MPa, different from weak interfacial failure that occurs in traditional strategies. The strong interfacial adhesion greatly enhances the stability of hydrogels against swelling destruction. This work opens up new inspirations for designing strongly anchored hydrogels from an interfacial chemistry perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>Blending to Make Nonhealable Polymers Healable: Nanophase Separation Observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Can commodity polymers are made to be healable just by blending with self&#8208;healable polymers? Here we report the first study on the fundamental aspect of this practically challenging issue. Poly(ether thiourea) (PTUEG3; Tg = 27 &#176;C) reported in 2018 is extraordinary in that it is mechanically robust but can self&#8208;heal even at 12 &#176;C. In contrast, poly(octamethylene thiourea) (PTUC8; Tg = 50 &#176;C), an analogue of PTUEG3, cannot heal below 92 &#176;C. We found that their polymer blend self&#8208;healed in a temperature range above 32 &#176;C even when its PTUEG3 content was only 20 mol %. Unlike PTUEG3 alone, this polymer blend, upon exposure to high humidity, barely plasticized, keeping its excellent mechanical properties due to the non&#8208;hygroscopic nature of the PTUC8 component. CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis revealed that the polymer blend was nanophase&#8208;separated, which possibly accounts for why such a small amount of PTUEG3 provided the polymer blend with humidity&#8208;tolerant self&#8208;healable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom or Dual&#8208;Atom in TiO2 Nanosheet: Which is the Better Choice for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As rising star materials, single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely reported in the electro&#8208;catalysis area. To answer the key question: single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts, which is better for electrocatalytic urea synthesis? we design two types of catalysts via a vacancy&#8208;anchorage strategy: single&#8208;atom Pd1&#8208;TiO2 and dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1&#8208;TiO2 nanosheets. An ultrahigh urea activity of 166.67 molurea molPd&#8208;1 h1 with the corresponding 22.54 % Faradaic efficiency at &#8208;0.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved over Pd1Cu1&#8208;TiO2, which is much higher than that of Pd1&#8208;TiO2. Various characterization including an in&#8208;situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and theoretical calculations demonstrate that dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 site in Pd1Cu1&#8208;TiO2 is more favorable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8208;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier compared with Pd1 in Pd1&#8208;TiO2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Eschenmoser&#8217;s Salt as a Formylation Agent for the Synthesis of Indolizinecarbaldehydes and Their Use for Colorimetric Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;H bond formylation is the most immediate way to incorporate the versatile formyl group into (hetero)aromatics. However, the type of reagents and severe conditions involved in the classical formylation methods often curtail their application, especially in the presence of other functional groups. Herein, we present the Eschenmoser&#8217;s salt, a commercially available (dimethylamino)methylating chemical, as a useful reagent for the C&#8208;H formylation of indolizines and other compounds. The method is straightforward and mild, furnishing indolizinecarbaldehydes in modest&#8208;to&#8208;good yields with exclusive and remote regioselectivity. Furthermore, these compounds can be easily transformed into push&#8208;pull dyes and are highly selective in the colorimetric detection of nitrite, a substance extensively employed as preservative in the food industry, the concentration of which is crucial to control to prevent harmful effects in living organisms. The assay is simple, allowing the naked&#8208;eye detection of nitrite in solution or on a cotton swab for a wide range of concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Helicene&#8208;Based Ytterbium&#160;Coordination Polymer Displaying Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Room Temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of physical properties sensitive to molecular chirality in a single system allows the observation of fascinating phenomena such as Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) having potential applications for optical data readout and display technology. Homochiral monodimensional coordination polymers of YbIII were designed from a 2,15&#8208;bis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;hexahelicenic scaffold decorated with two terminal 4&#8208;pyridyl units. Thanks to the coordination of the chiral organic chromophore to Yb(hfac)3 units, efficient NIR&#8208;CPL activity is observed. Moreover, the specific crystal field around the YbIII induces a strong magnetic anisotropy which leads to a slow magnetic relaxation (SMM) and a remarkable room temperature MChD. The MChD&#8208;structural correlation is supported by computational investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Switched 2nd Order Non&#8208;Linear Optical Response in an Arylimido&#8208;Polyoxometalate with High Contrast and Cyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical responses have been demonstrated for the first time in polyoxometalates (POMs), with an arylimido&#8208;derivative showing a leading combination of high on/off contrast (94%), high visible transparency, and cyclability. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical and TD&#8208;DFT studies indicate that the switch&#8208;off results from weakened charge transfer (CT) character of the electronic transitions in the reduced state. This represents the first study of an imido&#8208;POM reduced state, and demonstrates the potential of POM hybrids as electrochemically activated molecular switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic Shielding Boosts Electrochemical Performance of Alloy&#8208;Type Anode Materials of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of alloy&#8208;type anode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries are always obstructed by enormous volume variation upon cycles. Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (&#956;&#8208;Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K+ ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565 mAh g&#8208;1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of ~3.5 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 100 cycles. This method does not involve time&#8208;consuming preparation, sophisticated instruments and expensive reagents, exhibiting the promising potential for other anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Silver&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogen Abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond of the Benzylic C&#945; atom for Cleavage of Alkyl Aryl Ether Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond is an important process in organic synthesis, where efficiently activating a specific C(sp3)&#8208;H bond without causing side reactions remains one of chemistry&#8217;s great challenges. Here we report that illuminated plasmonic silver metal nanoparticles (NPs) can abstract hydrogen from the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond of the C&#945; atom of an alkyl aryl ether &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage. The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field generated at the illuminated plasmonic NPs promotes chemisorption of the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 compound and the transfer of photo&#8208;generated hot electrons from the NPs to the adsorbed molecules leads to hydrogen abstraction and direct cleavage of the unreactive ether C&#946;&#8208;O bond under moderate reaction conditions (~90&#176;C). The plasmon&#8208;driven process has certain exceptional features: enabling hydrogen abstraction from a specific C(sp3)&#8208;H bond, along with precise scission of the targeted C&#8208;O bond to form aromatic compounds containing unsaturated, substituted groups in excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a&#160;Fully Non&#8208;Fused Bulk Heterojunction toward Efficient and Low&#8208;Cost Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To modulate the miscibility between donor and acceptor materials both possessing fully non&#8208;fused ring structures, a series of electron acceptors (A4T&#8208;16, A4T&#8208;31 and A4T&#8208;32) with different polar functional substituents were synthesized and investigated. The three acceptors show good planarity, high conformational stability, complementary absorption and energy levels with the non&#8208;fused polymer donor (PTVT&#8208;BT). Among them, A4T&#8208;32 possesses the strongest polar functional group and shows the highest surface energy, which facilitates morphological modulation in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend. Benefiting from the proper morphology control method, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.0% and a superior fill factor over 0.796 are achieved in the PTVT&#8208;BT:A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based organic photovoltaic cells with superior photoactive materials price advantage, which represent the highest value for the cells based on the non&#8208;fused blend films. Notably, this cell maintains ~84% of its initial PCE after nearly 2000 h under the continuous simulated 1&#8208;sun&#8208;illumination. In addition, the flexible PTVT&#8208;BT:A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based cells were fabricated and delivered a decent PCE of 14.6%. This work provides an effective molecular design strategy for the non&#8208;fused NFAs from the aspect of bulk morphology control in fully non&#8208;fused BHJ layers, which is crucial for their practical applications.</dc:description>

Further, we provide evidence of the chemical feasibility of this proposal via the facile conversion of synthetic alstolucines into alstonlarsine A via a short, efficient sequence of&#160;N&#8208;methylation,&#160;&#223;&#8208;elimination, and a cascade 1,7&#8208;hydride shift/Mannich cyclization. We believe that this is the first biogenetic proposal involving the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221;, a hydride&#8208;shift&#8208;based internal redox trigger of a Mannich cyclization. A further interesting feature of the cascade is that its stereochemical outcome likely originates in conformational preferences during the hydride shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Nickel Anchored on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon/TiO2&#160;Composite for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CH4 Oxidation to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenated products is a sustainable strategy for methane valorization at room temperature. However, in this reaction, noble metals are generally needed to function as cocatalysts for obtaining adequate activity and selectivity. Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/TiO2 composite (Ni&#8208;NC/TiO2) as a highly active and selective catalyst for photooxidation of CH4 to C1 oxygenates with O2 as the only oxidant. Ni&#8208;NC/TiO2 exhibits a yield of C1 oxygenates of 198 &#956;mol for 4 h with a selectivity of 93%, exceeding that of most reported high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;NC sites not only enhance the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to isolated Ni atoms but also dominantly facilitate the activation of O2 to form the key intermediate &#8226;OOH radicals, which synergistically lead to a substantial enhancement in both activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivities are one of the most highly sought for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivities of sulfide electrolytes (~10&#8208;8 S cm&#8208;1) lead to electron smooth transport through the sulfide electrolyte pellets, resulting in Li dendrite directly depositing at the grain boundaries (GBs) and serious discharge self&#8208;discharge. Here, a grain&#8208;boundary electronic insulation (GBEI) strategy is proposed to block electron transport across the GBs, enabling Li&#8208;Li symmetric cells with 30 times longer cycling life and Li&#8208;LiCoO2 full cells with three times lower self&#8208;discharging rate than pristine sulfide electrolytes. The Li&#8208;LiCoO2 ASSLBs deliver high capacity retention of 80% at 650 cycles and stable cycling performance for over 2600 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2. The innovation of the GBEI strategy provides a new direction to pursue high&#8208;performance ASSLBs depending on electronic conductivity toleration.</dc:description>

         <title>Zincophilic Electrode Interphase  with Appended Proton Reservoir Ability Stabilizes Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rampant dendrites and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) resulting from the turbulent interfacial evolution at the anode/electrolyte are the main culprits of short lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal batteries. In this work, a versatile protective coating with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric features is constructed on the surface of Zn metal (ZP@Zn) as dendrite&#8208;free anodes. This kind of protective coating possesses the advantages of reversible proton storage and rapid desolvation kinetics, thereby mitigating the HER and facilitating homogeneous nucleation concomitantly. Furthermore, the space charge polarization effect promotes charge redistribution to achieve uniform Zn deposition. Accordingly, the ZP@Zn symmetric cell manifests excellent reversibility at an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 4750 mA h cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling at 65% depth of discharge (DOD). The ZP@Zn//V6O13 pouch cell also reveals superior cycling stability with a high capacity of 326.6 mA h g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization using Vinyl Ethers as Effective Chain Transfer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic living ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization (ROMP) method is described that relies on a&#160;degenerative, reversible and regioselective&#160;exchange of propagating&#160;Fischer&#8208;carbenes.&#160;All characteristics of a living polymerization such as narrow dispersity, excellent molar mass&#160;control and the ability to form block copolymers are achieved by this method. The method allows the use of up to 200 times less ruthenium complex than traditional living ROMP. We demonstrate the synthesis of ROMP&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers, ATRP from a ROMP macro&#8208;initiator and living ROMP from a PEG&#8208;based macro chain transfer agent. The cost&#8208;effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis of degradable polymers and block copolymers enabled by this strategy will find various applications in biomedicine,&#160;materials science, and technology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free molecular catalyst&#8208;based photocathode that is active for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO and methanol. The photoelectrode is composed of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules anchored on graphene oxide and integrated via a (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker to p&#8208;type silicon protected by a thin film of titanium dioxide. The photocathode reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity at potentials as mild as 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Methanol production is observed at an onset potential of &#8208;0.36 V vs RHE, and reaches a peak turnover frequency of 0.18 s&#8208;1. To date, this is the only molecular catalyst&#8208;based photoelectrode that is active for the six&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to methanol. This work puts forth a strategy for interfacing molecular catalysts to p&#8208;type semiconductors and demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction to CO and methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Transport in Metal Nanocluster&#8208;Based Spin Valves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new type of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid semiconductor, quantum confined atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) have been widely applied in the fields of chemical sensing, optical imaging, biomedicine and catalysis. Herein, we successfully design and fabricate the first example of MNC&#8208;based spin valves (SVs) that exhibit remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to 1.6% even at room temperature (300 K). The concomitant photoresponse of MNC&#8208;based SVs unambiguously confirms that the spin&#8208;polarized electron transmission takes place across the MNC interlayer. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;dependent transport property of MNC&#8208;based SVs is largely varied by changing the atomic structure of MNCs. Both experimental proofs and quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the atomic structure&#8208;discriminative spin transport behavior is attributed to the distinct spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect of MNCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Lithiated Organic Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials have shown application potential in lithium batteries owing to their high capacity, abundant resources, and structural designability. However, the most reported organic cathodes are at oxidized states (namely unlithiated compounds) and thus need to couple with Li&#8208;rich anodes. In contrast, lithiated organic cathode materials could act as Li reservoir and match with Li&#8208;free anodes such as graphite, showing great promise for practical full&#8208;battery applications. Here we summarize the synthesis, stability and battery applications of lithiated organic cathode materials, including synthetic methods, stability against O2 and H2O in air, and strategies to improve comprehensive electrochemical performance. Future works should be focused on new redox chemistries and construction of full batteries with lithiated organic cathodes and commercial anodes under practical conditions. This Minireview will encourage more efforts on lithiated organic cathode materials and finally promote their commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Complexes with Diazoolefin Ligands and their Photochemical Conversion into Alkenylidene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homometallic copper complexes with alkenylidene ligands are discussed as intermediates in catalysis but the isolation of such complexes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the structural characterization of copper complexes with bridging and terminal alkenylidene ligands. The compounds were obtained by irradiation of Cu(I) complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefins ligands. The complex with a terminal alkenylidene ligand required isolation in a crystalline matrix, and its structural characterization was enabled by in crystallo photolysis at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Borylation of Alkynes and Vinylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Remote functionalization involving a fascinating chain&#8208;walking process has emerged as a powerful strategy for the rapid access to value&#8208;added functional molecules from readily available feedstocks. However, the scope of current methods is predominantly limited to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes. The remote functionalization of multi&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is challenging, and the use of alkynes in the chain walking is unexplored. We herein report a rhodium catalyzed remote borylation of internal alkynes, offering an unprecedented reaction mode of alkynes for the preparation of synthetically valuable 1,n&#8208;diboronates. The regioselective distal migratory hydroboration of sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates is also demonstrated to furnish various multi&#8208;boronic esters. Synthetic utilities are highlighted through the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products such as the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Hierarchical Recognition&#8208;Mediated Senolytics for Reliable Regulation of Cellular Senescence and Anti&#8208;Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise regulation of vascular senescence represents a far&#8208;reaching strategy to combat age&#8208;related diseases. However, the high heterogeneity of senescence, alongside the lack of targeting and potent senolytics, makes it very challenging. Here we report a molecular design to tackle this challenge through multidimensional, hierarchical recognition of three hallmarks commonly shared among senescence, namely, aptamer&#8208;mediated recognition of a membrane marker for active cell targeting, a self&#8208;immolative linker responsive to lysosomal enzymes for switchable drug release, and a compound against antiapoptotic signaling for clearance. Such senolytic can target and trigger severe cell apoptosis in broad&#8208;spectrum senescent endothelial cells, and importantly, distinguish them from the quiescent state. Its potential for in vivo treatment of vascular diseases is successfully illustrated in a model of atherosclerosis, with effective suppression of the plaque progression yet negligible side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Petrochemical&#8208;Free Route to Superelastic Hierarchical Cellulose Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellulose aerogels are plagued by intermolecular hydrogen bond&#8208;induced structural plasticity, otherwise rely on chemicals modification to extend service life. Here, we demonstrate a petrochemical&#8208;free strategy to fabricate superelastic cellulose aerogels by designing hierarchical structures at multi scales. Oriented channels consolidate the whole architecture. Porous walls of dehydrated cellulose derived from thermal etching not only exhibit decreased rigidity and stickiness, but also guide the microscopic deformation and mitigate localized large strain, preventing structural collapse. The aerogels show exceptional stability, including temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity, fatigue resistance (~5% plastic deformation after 105 cycles), high angular recovery speed (1475.4&#176; s&#8208;1), outperforming most cellulose&#8208;based aerogels. This benign strategy retains the biosafety of biomass and provides an alternative filter material for health&#8208;related applications, such as face masks and air purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Manipulation of a Minimalistic Hydrocarbon Nanocar on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanocars are carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;molecules with a precise design that facilitates their atomic&#8208;scale control on a surface. The rational design of these molecules is important in atomic and molecular&#8208;scale manipulation to advance the development of molecular machines, as well as for a better understanding of self&#8208;assembly, diffusion and desorption processes. Here, we introduce the molecular design and construction of a minimalistic nanocar. Our nanocar features an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, we show controlled and fast manipulation of the nanovehicle along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The mechanism behind the successful displacement is the induced dipole created over the nanocar by the STM tip. We utilized carbon monoxide functionalized tips both to avoid decomposition and accidentally picking the nanocars up during the manipulation. This strategy allowed thousands of maneuvers to successfully win the Nanocar Race II championship.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Helical Nanofibrous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite signi&#64257;cant progress on the design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), precise control over microstructures of such materials remains challenging. Herein, two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies were constructed via an unprecedented template&#8208;free method, capitalizing on the diastereoselective formation of aminal linkages. Detailed time&#8208;dependent experiments reveal the spontaneous transformation of initial rod&#8208;like aggregates into the double&#8208;helical microstructures. We further demonstrated that the helical chirality and circular dichroism signal can be facilely inversed by simply adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis. Moreover, by transferring chirality to achiral fluorescent molecular adsorbents, the helical COF nanostructures can effectively induce circularly polarized luminescence with the highest luminescent asymmetric factor (glum) up to &#8764;0.01.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Isomerization Between Silacyclopropyl Cation and Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation has been synthesized and fully characterized. Of particular interest, this silacyclopropyl cation reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene at RT via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8208;P bond. Although the silylene has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by the isolation of the corresponding disilene dimer as well as by trapping reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Preussomerins: Control of Spiroacetal Stereogenicity by Photochemical Reaction of Naphthoquinone via 1,6&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first enantioselective total syntheses of preussomerins EG1, EG2, and EG3. The key transformation is a stereospecific photochemical reaction involving a 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to achieve retentive replacement of C&#8211;H&#8594;C&#8211;O bond, allowing otherwise&#8208;difficult control of the spiroacetal stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Monolithic Phosphate Interphase for Highly Reversible and Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc metal battery (ZMB) is promising as the next generation of energy storage system, but challenges relating to dendrites and corrosion of the zinc anode are restricting its practical application. Here, to stabilize Zn anode, we report a controlled electrolytic method for a monolithic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via a high dipole moment solvent dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). The DMMP&#8208;based electrolytes can generate a homogeneous and robust phosphate SEI (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6). Benefiting from the protecting impact of this in&#8208;situ monolithic SEI, the zinc electrode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling of 4700 h and a high Coulombic efficiency 99.89% in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cell, respectively. The full V2O5|Zn battery with DMMP&#8208;H2O hybrid electrolyte exhibits a high capacity retention of 82.2% following 4000 cycles under 5 A g&#8208;1. The first success in constructing the monolithic phosphate SEI will open a new avenue in electrolyte design for highly reversible and stable Zn metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Learning Framework for the Automated Recognition of Molecules in Scanning&#8208;Probe&#8208;Microscopy Images</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a deep&#8208;learning framework to automatically analyse scanning&#8208;probe&#8208;microscopy data, which requires only a small number of image samples to achieve high accuracy. This work provides a strategy to accelerate data mining and the discovery of new materials.







Abstract
Computer vision as a subcategory of deep learning tackles complex vision tasks by dealing with data of images. Molecular images with exceptionally high resolution have been achieved thanks to the development of techniques like scanning probe microscopy (SPM). However, extracting useful information from SPM image data requires careful analysis which heavily relies on human supervision. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework using an advanced computer vision algorithm, Mask R&#8208;CNN, to address the challenge of molecule detection, classification and instance segmentation in binary molecular nanostructures. We employ the framework to determine two triangular&#8208;shaped molecules of similar STM appearance. Our framework could accurately differentiate two molecules and label their positions. We foresee that the application of computer vision in SPM images will become an indispensable part in the field, accelerating data mining and the discovery of new materials.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Outer&#8208;Shells for Sequential Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, photocatalytic CO2&#8208;CO&#8208;CH4 conversion is realized by hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with hetero&#8208;shells. The enriched local CO concentration in inner shells and continuous protonation of CO on the outer&#8208;most shell enable the two&#8208;step tandem CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering hierarchical microreactors toward efficient tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Constructing delicate nano&#8208;/microreactors with tandem active sites in hierarchical architectures is a promising strategy for designing photocatalysts to realize the challenging but attractive CO2 reduction. Herein, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with spatial ordered hetero&#8208;shells are fabricated, which achieve two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction. The multiple inner CeO2 shells increase the number of active catalytic sites to ensure efficient first&#8208;step reaction for generating CO, along with enriching the local CO concentration. The second&#8208;step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction is consequently induced by amorphous TiO2 (A&#8208;TiO2) composites on the adjacent outer&#8208;most shell, thus realizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion capability using one CeO2@CeO2/A&#8208;TiO2 HoMS. In&#8208;depth explorations in the microreactors provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering HoMS&#8208;based microreactors with temporally&#8211;spatially ordered shells toward efficient tandem catalysis.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Organoplatinum(II) Complexes for Subcellular Distribution and Cell Viability Monitoring with Differentiated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation affinities of the platinum(II) complexes enable them to exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red, attributed to the extent of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The platinum(II) complex is applied to manifest the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells.







Abstract
The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self&#8208;assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.

         <title>Substrate Induced Movement of the Metal Cofactor between Active and Resting State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyruvate dependent Class II aldolases require a ketoacid to induce a metal shift from resting state to active enzyme. This occurs without alterations in the protein structure and might be a common, but to date overlooked, feature in many metalloproteins.







Abstract
Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far&#8208;reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor's properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (SwHKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M2+R), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M2+A) at 2.4&#8197;&#197; distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M2+A affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M2+R to M2+A. While not described earlier, this type of regulation may be widespread and largely overlooked due to low occupancy of some of its states in protein crystal structures.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemisorbing a prototypical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to a dense packed layer of metalloporphyrins pulls out complete metalloporphyrins into the second layer. This dynamic and reversible phenomenon was unraveled by structural, spectroscopic, desorption and theoretical investigations. The molecular rearrangement of the metallorganic layer is paralleled to NHCs pulling out single metal atoms from surfaces due to strong adsorption.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analysed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganisation can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalisation of surfaces with carbenes.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency CO2/N2 Separation Enabled by Rotation of Electrostatically Anchored Flexible Ligands in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible rotating ligands in a metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) can be anchored by electrostatic negative molecules (e.g., CF3COO&#8722;). Rotation of electrostatically anchored flexible ligands opens four&#8208;membered (4&#8208;M) windows that enable precise CO2/N2 separation.







Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are of great potential for molecular separation, but the ligand rotation flexibility makes them remain challenging in the construction of fixed nanochannels for precise sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208;anchoring strategy to fix the rotation of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM) ligand in ZIF&#8208;8. Electrostatic inducer trifluoroacetate anchored at and blocked the six&#8208;membered windows of ZIF&#8208;8, and meanwhile induced the positive 2&#8208;MIM rotated from initial 49&#176; to 68&#176;, thus opening neighbored four&#8208;membered windows with a constant size of 3.4&#8197;&#197;. The obtained ZIF&#8208;8 significantly enhanced the CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity from 14.02 to 332.86. Further membrane&#8208;based separation exhibited an outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity of up to 137 with a desired permeability of 286 Barrer, which exceeded the 2019 upper bound. This strategy provides a new inspiration for fixing the ligand rotation in soft MOF for desired precise molecular sieving.

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Hybridization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Intrinsic Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic aperture size of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is realized by embedding graphene nanoribbons into the crystal. Particularly, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; is observed for the ZIF&#8208;8, resulting in sharp H2/CO2 separation. The atomistic molecular transport mechanism is investigated with molecular dynamics simulation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are promising for gas separation membrane, but their molecular cut&#8208;off differs from that expected from its intrinsic aperture structure because of their flexibility. Herein, we introduced graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to rigidify the ZIF framework. Because the sp2 edge of the GNRs induces strong anchoring effects, the modified layer can be rigidified. Particularly, when the GNRs were embedded and distributed in the ZIF&#8208;8 layer, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; was observed, resulting in high H2/CO2 separation (H2 permeance: 5.2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;mol/m2&#8201;Pa&#8201;s, ideal selectivity: 142). The performance surpasses the upper bound of polycrystalline MOF membrane performance. In addition, the membrane can be applied to blue H2 production, as demonstrated with a simulated steam reformed gas containing H2/CO2/CH4. The separation performance was retained in the presence of water. The fundamentals of the molecular transport through the rigid ZIF&#8208;8 framework were revealed using molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Crownphyrins: Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of the Porphyrin&#8208;Crown Ether Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crownphyrins, hybrid systems forged from porphyrin and crown ether counterparts, were synthesized. The novel family of macrocycles serves as dynamic, conformationally flexible systems, able to undergo guest&#8208;induced, reversible expansion. The tunable character of their cavities allows for binding neutral and ionic guests.







Abstract
Crownphyrins are hybrid macrocycles combining structural features of porphyrin and crown ethers. The molecular architecture renders them an intriguing class of hosts capable of binding neutral, and ionic guests. The presence of dynamic covalent imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes. The remarkable metal&#8208;mediated expansion to the helical [2+2] macrocyclic complex is reversible. The reaction of the figure&#8208;eight mercury(II) assembly with [2.2.2]cryptand results in ring contraction providing the metal&#8208;free crownphyrin macrocycle.

The presence of dynamic covalent imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes. The remarkable metal-mediated expansion to the helical [2+2] macrocyclic complex is reversible. The reaction of the figure-eight mercury(II) assembly with [2.2.2]cryptand results in ring contraction providing the metal-free crownphyrin macrocycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#928;&#8211;&#928; Stacking Complex Induces Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions To Synthesize Functionalized Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reaction for the reductive generation of synthetically important &#945;&#8208;amino radicals proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complex. Multiple &#960; interactions stabilize the reactive intermediate, and neither a photocatalyst nor an initiator are required. This synthetic pathway enabled the synthesis of complex functionalized amines in high yield.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and ion&#8208;pairing interactions induced the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals under the irradiation of visible light without the requirement of an expensive photocatalyst. This strategy enabled the construction of functionalized amines via three&#8208;component coupling reactions with broad scope (we report &gt;50 examples with an up to 90&#8201;% yield). This synthetic pathway also delivered complex functionalized amines with a very high yield. Quantum chemistry Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations identified &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complexes; time&#8208;dependent DFT was employed to simulate the absorption spectra, and nudged elastic band (NEB) methodology provided a possible interaction/reaction picture of the selected species.

         <title>A Sensitive and Reversible Labeling Strategy Enables Global Mapping of the Core&#8208;Fucosylated Glycoproteome on Cell Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that locate on cell surfaces can be selectively probed by a reversible labeling strategy, enabling the global mapping of the core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome.







Abstract
Core fucosylation, the attachment of &#945;1,6&#8208;fucose to the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of N&#8208;glycans, has a strong relationship with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, prognosis, and immune evasion by regulating many membrane proteins. However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell&#8208;surface core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell&#8208;surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.

         <title>Combination Cancer Treatment: Using Engineered DNAzyme Molecular Machines for Dynamic Inter&#8208; and Intracellular Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines was designed for promoting cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. Our strategy resulted in an enhanced killing effect, demonstrated using zinc deficient cancer cells, thus providing a promising next&#8208;generation combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
Despite the promise of combination cancer therapy, it remains challenging to develop targeted strategies that are nontoxic to normal cells. Here we report a combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines that can promote cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. To achieve external regulation of T&#8208;cell/cancer cell interactions, we designed a DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with an aptamer and an i&#8208;motif, as the MUC&#8208;1&#8208;selective aptamer allows the specific recognition of cancer cells. The i&#8208;motif is folded under the tumor acidic microenvironment, shortening the intercellular distance. As a result, T&#8208;cells are released by metal ion activated DNAzyme cleavage. To achieve internal regulation of mitochondria, we delivered another DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with mitochondria&#8208;targeted peptides into cancer cells to induce mitochondria aggregation. Our strategy achieved an enhanced killing effect in zinc deficient cancer cells.

         <title>Semisynthetic Viral Inhibitor for Light Control of the MHC I Peptide Loading Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immune system supervises every cell via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, which are prepared in the peptide loading complex (PLC). Using a light&#8208;activated viral nanotool, the authors succeeded in spatiotemporally controlling antigen processing and reconstituting a completely active native PLC. The photo&#8208;conditional function of PLC was analyzed with a flow cytometry&#8208;based assay at single&#8208;organelle resolution.







Abstract
The immune system detects virally or malignantly transformed cells via peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex class&#8197;I (pMHC&#8197;I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC I molecules are loaded with cargo peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the highly dynamic multiprotein peptide loading complex (PLC). Here, we developed a semisynthetic approach to generate a photocleavable immune modulator ICP47 of Herpes simplex virus. Using this nanotool, we revealed key mechanistic events of the purified PLC, such as peptide binding and translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, triggered by light. We established a single&#8208;organelle flow cytometry assay to monitor light&#8208;controlled activation of the antigen processing machinery in native ER membranes. This photochemical modulation opens new opportunities for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the antigen processing machinery in vitro and native membrane environment.

         <title>Confinement of the Triplet States in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated BODIPY Dimers Linked with Ethynylene or Butadiynylene Bridges: A Different View on the Effect of Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet wave functions of BODIPY dimers with symmetrically structured ethynylene or butadienylene linkers are highly localized on one BODIPY moiety, which differs from previous findings for meso&#8208;to&#8208;meso porphyrin oligomers. This study provides a new understanding of triplet state confinement and molecular symmetry.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of the excited state wavefunction confinement is crucial for the engineering of the photophysical properties and applications of organic chromophores. In the present contribution, the localization of the triplet state wavefunctions of some symmetric ethyne/butadiyne bridged BODIPY dimers and asymmetric BODIPY derivatives presenting extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation frameworks is studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations. Based on the Zero Field Splitting D parameters, we conclude that the triplet state wavefunctions are highly localized on one BODIPY unit in the symmetric dimers, which is consistent with the ab initio modelling that finds delocalized triplet state destabilized by 12&#8211;14&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to its localized counterpart. The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.

The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microhydrated 3&#8208;Methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol: Evolution of the Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network from Chains to Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas&#8208;phase MOM&#8208;(H2O)n (n=0&#8211;6) clusters are studied using rotational spectroscopy. The growth of the H&#8208;bonding networks in these complexes exhibits characteristic transitions from one&#8208;dimensional chains, to two&#8208;dimensional rings, and further to three&#8208;dimensional arrangements that leads to a &#8220;cube&#8221;&#8208;like network resembling the pure water octamer.







Abstract
Broadband rotational spectroscopy is used to investigate the geometries of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol and its complexes with up to six water molecules, which are produced in supersonic jets. The main low&#8208;energy isomers of these clusters are unambiguously identified in the spectra with the support of quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The conformation of the 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol geometry is found to be influenced by the microsolvation effects. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrangements in the hydrate complexes, which are governed by the water&#8208;water and water&#8208;solute interactions, exhibit characteristic configurations with increasing number of water molecules and resemble the main isomers of the corresponding pure water clusters. Evolution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding structures from one&#8208;dimensional chains to two&#8208;dimensional rings and further to multicyclic three&#8208;dimensional networks is observed, which provides information about the build&#8208;up process.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Facilitated Detection and Sequencing of 5&#8208;Formylcytidine RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem Wittig&#8208;cyclization reaction was initiated with the use of triphenyl phosphonium ylide under light irradiation for the chemical labelling of 5&#8208;formylcytidine f5C RNA, making it possible to detect trace amount of f5C in cell lysates and to develop a new sequencing strategy named paC&#8208;Seq for cytosine in a single&#8208;base resolution.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formylcytidine (f5C) is one of the epigenetic nucleotides in tRNA. Despite the evident importance of f5C in gene expression regulation, little is known about its exact amount and position. To capture this information, we developed a modification&#8208;specific functionalization with a semi&#8208;stabilized ylide. The chemical labelling exhibited a high selectivity towards f5C and allowed distinction from similar 5&#8208;formyluridine. We realized a detection strategy based on the fluorescence signal of the cyclization product 4,5&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine&#8208;cytidine paC, which exhibited a high quantum yield. The results clearly identified f5C with a limit of detection at 0.58&#8197;nM. This method altered the hydrogen bonding activities of f5C and modulated its reverse transcription signature in its sequencing profile. We showed that f5C can be detected from tRNA segments with a single&#8208;base resolution. Taken together, this approach is a sensitive, antibody&#8208;free, and applicable detection and sequencing method for f5C&#8208;containing RNA.

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Creutz&#8211;Taube ion was prepared as an excited state that includes a bridging pyrazine radical anion. It features an intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfer band, which allowed to directly address electronic delocalization and electronic coupling in the excited state. This species is competent for photoinduced electron transfer, illustrating the potential of photoinduced mixed valence species for photocatalysis.







Abstract
The excited&#8208;state version of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion was prepared via visible light excitation of [(NH3)5RuII(&#956;&#8208;pz)RuII(NH3)5]4+. The resulting excited state is a mixed valence {RuIII&#8211;&#948;(&#956;&#8208;pz&#8901;&#8722;)RuII+&#948;} transient species, which was characterized using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with vis&#8208;NIR detection. Very intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfers were observed at 7500&#8197;cm&#8722;1, revealing an excited&#8208;state electronic coupling element HDA=3750&#8197;cm&#8722;1. DFT calculations confirm a strongly delocalized excited state. A notable consequence of strong electron delocalization is the nanosecond excited state lifetime, which was exploited in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept intermolecular electron transfer. The excited&#8208;state Creutz&#8211;Taube ion is established as a reference, and demonstrates that electron delocalization in the excited state can be leveraged for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic schemes based on electron transfer chemistry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylative Cyclization of Alkenes with Alkyl Bromides via Radical Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described a new copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with unactivated alkyl bromides. In this reaction, two carbonyl groups were introduced into the double bond by the insertion of two molecules of carbon monoxide, and four new C&#8722;C bonds could be constructed in one reaction. At the same time, the corresponding skeletons of &#945;&#8208;tetralones as well as 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;one were obtained smoothly, which could also be transformed into three consecutive ring structures via subsequent derivatizations.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a new procedure on 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with alkyl bromides. Using simple copper catalyst, two molecules of carbon monoxide were introduced into the double bond with the formation of four new C&#8722;C bonds and a new ring. Various &#945;&#8208;tetralones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones were formed in moderate to good yields.

A novel hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) is fabricated via two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the unique bonding interface of PODA/MnO2 and dual&#8208;energy storage mechanism of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion, C@PODA/MnO2 cathode exhibits high capacity, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability for aqueous Zn batteries.







Abstract
Due to the excellent specific capacity and high working voltage, manganese oxide (MnO2) has attracted considerable attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the irreversible structural collapse and sluggish ionic diffusion lead to poor rate capability and inferior lifespan. Herein, we proposed a novel organic/inorganic hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) for AZIBs. Various in/ex situ analyses and theoretical calculations prove that PODA chains with C=N groups can provide a more active surface/interface for ion/electron mobility and zinc ion storage in the hybrid cathode. More importantly, newly formed Mn&#8722;N interfacial bonds can effectively promote ion diffusion and prevent Mn atoms dissolution, enhancing redox kinetics and structural integrity of MnO2. Accordingly, C@PODA/MnO2 cathode exhibits high capacity (321&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 or 1.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), superior rate performance (88&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles. Hence, rational interfacial designs shed light on the development of organic/inorganic cathodes for advanced AZIBs.

         <title>Building Square Planar Cobalt (II) Complexes via Sodium Mediated Cobaltation of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mixed Na/CoII tris(amido) base enables the selective cobaltation of a range of fluoroarenes furnishing a new family of square planar tetra(aryl) complexes. Mechanistic investigations shed light on the key roles played by each metal, uncovering two alternative types of bimetallic cooperation for the metalation step, which is then followed by a fast ligand rearrangement driven by the coordination preference of the alkali&#8208;metal.







Abstract
While cobalt complexes have already shown their potential for C&#8722;H and C&#8722;F bond activation of fluoroarenes, their reactivity as metalating agents via Co&#8722;H exchange towards these substrates has not been explored. Herein, we report a Co(HMDS)2 [HMDS=N(SiMe3)2] system which, when synergistically enhanced via sodium amide Na(HMDS) mediation, can render chemo&#8208; and regioselective cobaltation of a series of fluoroarenes to produce a new class of homoleptic square planar [Na2CoAr4] complexes. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the key roles of the Na/Co counterparts in a stepwise sodiation/cobalt transmetalation process, leading to this novel C&#8722;H metalation. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, this process can occur inter&#8208; or intramolecularly, furnishing transient [NaCo(HMDS)2Ar] intermediates which can undergo ligand rearrangement to afford [Na2CoAr4] with concomitant formation of Co(HMDS)2 and [NaCo(HMDS)3].

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Control of Topochemical Polymer Single Crystals with Tunable Elastic Modulus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemically reactive single crystals of bis(indandione) derivatives were carefully functionalized by controlling side chain length as well as introducing different end groups on the side chains. While maintaining topochemical reactivities, modifying side chains can significantly affect polymerization kinetics and enhance polymer elastic modulus. Furthermore, polymer single crystals could be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust thin films.







Abstract
Topochemical polymerizations hold the promise of producing high molecular weight and stereoregular single crystalline polymers by first aligning monomers before polymerization. However, monomer modifications often alter the crystal packing and result in non&#8208;reactive polymorphs. Here, we report a systematic study on the side chain functionalization of the bis(indandione) derivative system that can be polymerized under visible light. Precisely engineered side chains help organize the monomer crystals in a one&#8208;dimensional fashion to maintain the topochemical reactivity. By optimizing the side chain length and end group of monomers, the elastic modulus of the resulting polymer single crystals can also be greatly enhanced. Lastly, using ultrasonication, insoluble polymer single crystals can be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust polymer thin films. This work provides new insights on the molecular design of topochemical reactions and paves the way for future applications of this fascinating family of materials.

         <title>Deciphering Ligand Controlled Structural Evolution of Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Electrochemical Activation during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution of the Prussian blue analogue precatalysts has been attained by replacing a &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acidic &#8722;NO. This in turn tunes the electronic and atomic structures and electrochemical properties of the active catalyst and a significant improvement in the alkaline water oxidation activity has been observed.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] with Co(OH)2@CC produced precatalysts PC&#8208;1 and PC&#8208;2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor &#8722;NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC&#8208;2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC&#8208;2 into active catalyst Fe&#8722;Co(OH)2&#8208;Co(O)OH (AC&#8208;2) has been attained only in 15&#8197;CV cycles while 600&#8197;CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC&#8208;1 into AC&#8208;1. The X&#8208;ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co&#8722;O and Fe&#8722;O bond in AC&#8208;2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC&#8208;1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC&#8208;2 and assists in the O&#8722;O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.

         <title>Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous coordination cages (PCCs) are known for their strong intermolecular interaction and high stability for homogeneous catalysis. In this work, a photo&#8208;active molecule, PTH, was assembled into PCC&#8208;40, which showed excellent photocatalytic performance in dehalogenation and photo&#8208;borylation. The synergistic effect of multi catalytic centers was studied. The results may provide future directions for improvement of a large group of photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;catalysis by small&#8208;molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron&#8208;transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;phenothiazine (PTH)&#8208;derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single&#8208;electron transfer, was utilized for photo&#8208;catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage.

     alt="Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous coordination cages (PCCs) are known for their strong intermolecular interaction and high stability for homogeneous catalysis. In this work, a photo-active molecule, PTH, was assembled into PCC-40, which showed excellent photocatalytic performance in dehalogenation and photo-borylation. The synergistic effect of multi catalytic centers was studied. The results may provide future directions for improvement of a large group of photocatalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo-catalysis by small-molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron-transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N-phenyl-phenothiazine (PTH)-derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation-induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single-electron transfer, was utilized for photo-catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage. This discovery provides a potential strategy to improve the photophysical properties and stabilities of small-molecule organic photocatalysts via supramolecular chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isotropic Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity Cooperated with Installed Imidazolium Molecular Motions in a 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Phosphate Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystalline 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 salt of imidazole and phosphoric acid exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is observed for the first time in organic molecular crystals. Significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations was revealed to accelerate proton conduction via the 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded phosphate network by the depolarization effect.







Abstract
Utilizing molecular motion is essential for the use of anhydrous superprotonic molecular proton conductors (&#963; beyond 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) as electrolytes in hydrogen fuel cells. However, molecular motion contributing to the improvement of intrinsic proton conduction has been limited and little clarified in relation to the proton conduction mechanism, limiting the development of material design guidelines. Here, a salt with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) phosphate network with imidazolium cations installed inside was studied, whose components are known to exhibit molecular motions that contribute to proton conduction. Despite its anisotropic H&#8208;bonded network, the salt exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8776;351&#8197;K, which is the first example for organic molecular crystal. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural analysis and solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR measurements revealed significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations, which accelerate proton conduction via the 3D H&#8208;bonded phosphate network.

         <title>Steering the Ultrafast Opening and Closure Dynamics of a Photochromic Coordination Cage by Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast photodynamics of a dithienylethene&#8208;based coordination cage have been shown to vary depending on the nature of the encapsulated guest molecules. The ring&#8208;closure of the cage ligand can be suppressed through steric effects, while the reverse reaction competes with a population of the 3MLCT state that is enhanced by appropriate guest molecules.







Abstract
Photochemical studies on supramolecular hosts that can encapsulate small guest molecules commonly focus on three aspects: photoswitching the cage to release or trap the guest, the effect of the confining environment on the guest, and light&#8208;induced exciton or charge transfer within the cage structure. Here, we exploit ultrafast spectroscopy to address how the guest alters the photoswitching characteristics of the cage. For this, the impacts of three disparate guest compounds on ring&#8208;opening or ring&#8208;closure of a dithienylethene (DTE) ligand in a photoswitchable DTE&#8208;based coordination cage are juxtaposed. The guest modulates both outcome and timescale of the cage's photodynamics, by an interplay of structural strain, heavy&#8208;atom effect, and enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer processes exercised by the guest on the photo&#8208;excited cage. The approach might prove beneficial for attuning the applicability of photoswitchable nanocontainers and desired guest compounds.

         <title>The Role of Metal Adatoms in a Surface&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrogenation Reaction on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and electronic structure theory, we show that, contrary to previous consensus, surface adatoms can play a central role in the highly chemoselective cyclodehydrogenation of organic polymers.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation reactions are key steps in many metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical processes and in the on&#8208;surface synthesis of atomically precise nanomaterials. The principal role of the metal substrate in these reactions is undisputed, but the role of metal adatoms remains, to a large extent, unanswered, particularly on gold substrates. Here, we discuss their importance by studying the surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation on Au(111) as an ideal model case. We choose a polymer theoretically predicted to give one of two cyclization products depending on the presence or absence of gold adatoms. Scanning probe microscopy experiments observe only the product associated with adatoms. We challenge the prevalent understanding of surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation, unveiling the catalytic role of adatoms and their effect on regioselectivity. The study adds new perspectives to the understanding of metal catalysis and the design of on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols for novel carbon nanomaterials.

         <title>Spatially Directed Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots via Spidroin Templating in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein is a novel strategy for spatially confined biosynthesis of quantum dots in bacterium by using biomolecular condensates formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of recombinant spider silk protein. This provides a previously unprecedented access to compartmentalized nanostructure synthesis within living cells with great potential for in situ applications.







Abstract
Spatially directed synthesis of quantum dots (QDs) is intriguing yet challenging in organisms, due to the dispersed feature of templating biomolecules and precursors. Whether this task could be accomplished by biomolecular condensates, an emerging type of membraneless compartments in cells remains unknown. Here we report synthetic protein condensates for templated synthesis of QDs in bacterium Escherichia coli. This was realized by overexpression of spider silk protein to bind precursor ions and recruit other necessary components, which induced the spidroin to form more &#946;&#8208;sheet structures for assembly and maturation of the protein condensates. This in turn enabled formation and co&#8208;localization of the fluorescent QDs to &#8220;light up&#8221; the condensates, and alleviated cytotoxicity of the precursor heavy metal ions and resulting QDs. Thus, our results suggest a new strategy for nanostructure synthesis and deposition in subcellular compartments with great potential for in situ applications.

A supramolecular strategy has been developed to generate long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states in single&#8208;wall nanocarbon&#8208;derived multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids having different diameters. The occurrence of photoexcited electron transfer was demonstrated by employing a variety of physicochemical and transient absorption spectral studies that cover a wide spatial and temporal range.







Abstract
Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (DA) hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising functional materials for light energy conversion. However, the DA hybrids built on SWCNTs have failed to reveal the much&#8208;sought long&#8208;lived charge separation (CS) due to the close proximity of the DA entities facilitating charge recombination. Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi&#8208;modular DA hybrids capable of producing long&#8208;lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V&#8208;shape configured BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;&#8208;stacking. Supported by spectral, electrochemical, and computational studies, the established energy scheme revealed the possibility of sequential electron transfer. Systematic pump&#8208;probe studies covering wide spatial and temporal scales provided evidence of CS from the initial 1BODIPY* ultimately resulting in C60&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;SWCNT&#8901;+ CS states of lifetimes in the 20&#8208;microsecond range.

&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular strategy has been developed to generate long-lived charge-separated states in single-wall nanocarbon-derived multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids having different diameters. The occurrence of photoexcited electron transfer was demonstrated by employing a variety of physicochemical and transient absorption spectral studies that cover a wide spatial and temporal range.

         <title>Acceleration of Cathode Interfacial Kinetics by Liquid Organosulfides in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the poor electronic/ionic conductivity of the solid&#8208;liquid interface in Li&#8722;S battery, a strategy of replacing sulfur with liquid organosulfide (PTS) and constructing a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte using LHCE is reported, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the reaction mechanism to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus obtaining a good reaction kinetics and cycling stability.







Abstract
Great efforts have been made to tackle the issues of the shuttle effect and kinetics hysteresis in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery, but few on tuning the reaction path of sulfur cathode. Herein, we report a strategy to replace inorganic sulfur with liquid organosulfide and construct a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid conversion reaction to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus greatly improving the reaction kinetics. The Li|PTS half&#8208;cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at 0.5&#8197;C, with a capacity retention of 64.9&#8201;% after 750 cycles. The Li|PTS pouch cell with a high PTS loading of 3.1&#8197;g delivers a maximum capacity of 997&#8197;mAh and maintains 82.1&#8201;% of initial capacity after 50 cycles at the current of 100&#8197;mA. This work enriches the reaction mechanism of Li&#8722;S batteries and provides new insights for the development of interphase chemistry in the design of cathodes.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Modulated Nucleofugality of SeIII Species to Enable Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Semipinacol Manifolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox catalytic 1,2&#8208;carbon&#8208;shift manifold is enabled by an unprecedented OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;SeIII hydrogen bond co&#8208;activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds. While traditional oxidative methods for the activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds proceed through SeIV intermediates and commonly result in rapid elimination of the SeIV residue, this protocol facilitates, for the first time, the stereospecific substitution of SeIII nucleofuges by carbon nucleophiles.







Abstract
Chemical bond activations mediated by H&#8208;bond interactions involving highly electronegative elements such as nitrogen and oxygen are powerful tactics in modern catalysis research. On the contrary, kindred catalytic regimes in which heavier, less electronegative elements such as selenium engage in H&#8208;bond interactions to co&#8208;activate C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds under oxidative conditions are elusive. Traditional strategies to enhance the nucleofugality of selenium residues predicate on the oxidative addition of electrophiles onto SeII&#8208;centers, which entails the elimination of the resulting SeIV moieties. Catalytic procedures in which SeIV nucleofuges are substituted rather than eliminated are very rare and, so far, not applicable to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations. In this study, we introduce an unprecedented combination of O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se H&#8208;bond interactions and single electron oxidation to catalytically generate SeIII nucleofuges that allow for the formation of new C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds by means of a type I semipinacol process in high yields and excellent selectivity.

         <title>Engineering Transport Properties in Interconnected Enargite&#8208;Stannite Type Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A particular biphasic compound, which consists of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type tetrahedral frameworks at the nanoscale, has been synthesized. The complex crystal chemistry of such nanocomposites raises the issue of the role of the two structures and of their interfaces in the mechanism governing their electrical and thermal conductivities.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms that connect heat and electron transport with crystal structures and defect chemistry is fundamental to develop materials with thermoelectric properties. In this work, we synthesized a series of self&#8208;doped compounds Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 through Cu for Mn substitution. Using a combination of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and precession&#8208;assisted electron diffraction tomography, we evidence that the materials are composed of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type structures, via the formation of nanodomains with a high density of coherent interfaces. By combining experiments with ab initio electron and phonon calculations, we discuss the structure&#8211;thermoelectric properties relationships and clarify the interesting crystal chemistry in this system. We demonstrate that excess Cu+ substituted for Mn2+ dopes holes into the top of the valence band, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the power factor and figure of merit ZT.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Homologation of Carbonyl Compounds for Iterative Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced B&#252;chner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck type reaction for carbonyl homologation is described. The protocol allows the use of carbonyl compounds as safe and readily available diazo precursors through direct photoexcitation of corresponding N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. Functionalized aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are prepared in a practical and iterative manner.







Abstract
We describe a photo&#8208;induced reaction for the in situ generation of highly reactive alkyl diazo species from carbonyl precursors via photo&#8208;excitation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. The diazo intermediates undergo efficient C&#8722;H insertion of aldehydes, leading to the productive synthesis of aldehydes and ketones. The method is applicable to the iterative synthesis of densely functionalized carbonyl compounds through sequential trapping of the diazo species with various aldehydes. The reaction proceeds without the need of any catalyst by light irradiation and features high functional group tolerance. More than 70 examples, some performed on a gram&#8208;scale, demonstrate the broad applicability of this reaction sequence in synthesis.

         <title>Spin Effect to Promote Reaction Kinetics and Overall Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under External Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>

Spin polarization in CoSx loaded on carbon nanofibers obtained by electrospinning method regulate LiPS conversion reaction. The external magnetic field induces electron spin polarization in CoSx, reducing electron repulsion, and enhancing the degree of 2p&#8211;3d orbital hybridization, thus accelerating the conversion ability of lithium polysulfides and enabling carbon nanofiber/CoSx/S cathodes with unprecedented performance and stability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are still limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the slow Li&#8722;S reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that when using cobalt sulfide as a catalytic additive, an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the LiPS adsorption ability and the Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics. More specifically, the results show both experimentally and theoretically how an electron spin polarization of Co ions reduces electron repulsion and enhances the degree of orbital hybridization, thus resulting in LSBs with unprecedented performance and stability. Under an external magnetic field, LSBs with 0.0084&#8201;% per cycle decay rate at 2&#8197;C during 8150&#8197;cycles are produced. Overall, this work not only demonstrates an effective strategy to promote LiPS adsorption and electrochemical conversion in LSBs at no additional energy cost but also enriches the application of the spin effect in the electrocatalysis fields.

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>

LiTFSI&#8208;TMP&#8208;H2O electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stability window of 3.7&#8197;V are rationally designed by controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry. Benefiting from reduced H2O activity and reinforced solid electrolyte interphase, the assembled water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cell with a limited P/N ratio of 1.14 can achieve a long cycling life with high coulombic efficiency.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3.0&#8197;V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000&#8197;times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.

         <title>Discerning the Contributions of Gold Species in Butadiene Hydrogenation: From Single Atoms to Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to unveil the activity contributions of distinct gold species in butadiene hydrogenation. The strategy combines nanostructuring of single&#8208;atom gold catalysts, electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based automatic image analyses of the full metal ensembles, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies.







Abstract
Identification of the roles of different active sites is vital for the rational design of catalysts. We present a cutting&#8208;edge strategy to discern the contributions of different single&#8208;atom gold species and nanoparticles in 1,3&#8208;butadiene hydrogenation, through coupling of advanced spectroscopic techniques, electron microscopy&#8208;based automated image analyses, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies. While all the carbon&#8208;hosted single gold atoms display negligible initial activity, the in situ&#8208;evolved gold nanoparticles are highly active. Full metal&#8208;species quantification is realized by combining electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based atom recognition statistics and deep&#8208;learning&#8208;driven nanoparticle segmentation algorithm, allowing the structure&#8211;activity correlations for the hybrid catalysts containing different Au architectures to be established. Surface exposure density of Au nanoparticles, as revealed by electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based statistics, is revealed as a new and reliable activity descriptor.

         <dc:description>
Fluorescent multiblock microcolumns are fabricated relying on the cooperation between the controllable host&#8208;guest complexation of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and AIEgen guest and the hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on CB[8], NaBr and AIEgen guest. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly to be visualized, understood, and regulated.







Abstract
Due to the fast dynamics and re&#8208;equilibration of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, bottom&#8208;up molecular strategies to fabricate well&#8208;defined and controllable multiblock structures are rare. Herein, we propose a new concept for fabrication of fluorescent multiblock microcolumns containing 1 to 7 blocks via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), NaBr and an AIEgen guest. Through the complexation between CB[8] and different numbers of AIEgen guests (2, 1, 0), the competitive displacement caused by the binding of the sodium cation to the CB[8] portal, and the reversible assembly of positively charged guests in salt solutions, one&#8208;pot hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is realized. The molecular structure of each block is analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly of multiblocks to be visualized, understood, and regulated.

         <title>A Facile Strategy to Obtain Low&#8208;Cost and High&#8208;Performance Gold&#8208;Based Catalysts from Artificial Electronic Waste by [Zr48Ni6] Nano&#8208;Cages in MOFs for CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel metal&#8208;organic framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is the first MOF that can not only extract gold from artificial electronic waste, but is then converted into an effective catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. It offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Expensive gold&#8208;based catalysts are frequently used for electrochemical CO2 reduction into CO. A feasible approach to obtain low&#8208;cost Au&#8208;based catalysts is needed. Herein, a novel framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is prepared. It exhibits a high BET surface area of 1569&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high solvents/pH stability. 1 can not only selectively extract AuCl4&#8722; from artificial electronic waste, but can then be transformed into low&#8208;cost catalyst Au nanoparticle@1&#8208;x (Au NPs@1&#8208;x, x=1, 2, 3, 4) with tuneable Au NPs sizes. The CO2RR investigations revealed that the Au NPs@1&#8208;3 displayed an excellent FECO of 95.2&#8201;% with a current density of 102.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and such high catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 15&#8197;h without obvious decrease because the confinement effect of [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages prevents Au NPs agglomeration. This work offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts for various reactions activated by Au.

     alt="A Facile Strategy to Obtain Low-Cost and High-Performance Gold-Based Catalysts from Artificial Electronic Waste by [Zr48Ni6] Nano-Cages in MOFs for CO2 Electroreduction to CO"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel metal-organic framework &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; assembled from [Zr&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] nano-cages is the first MOF that can not only extract gold from artificial electronic waste, but is then converted into an effective catalyst for the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. It offers a facile strategy to obtain low-cost and high-performance Au-based catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive gold-based catalysts are frequently used for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into CO. A feasible approach to obtain low-cost Au-based catalysts is needed. Herein, a novel framework &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; assembled from [Zr&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] nano-cages is prepared. It exhibits a high BET surface area of 1569&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high solvents/pH stability. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can not only selectively extract AuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from artificial electronic waste, but can then be transformed into low-cost catalyst Au nanoparticle@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (Au NPs@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=1, 2, 3, 4) with tuneable Au NPs sizes. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR investigations revealed that the Au NPs@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-3 displayed an excellent FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of 95.2&#8201;% with a current density of 102.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and such high catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 15&#8197;h without obvious decrease because the confinement effect of [Zr&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] nano-cages prevents Au NPs agglomeration.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Chemicals from Contaminated Water Sources Using Magnetic Fluorinated Polymer Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic polymer sorbents (polymer@IONPs) were prepared for rapid, selective and efficient removal of multiple per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from real contaminated waters at environmentally relevant concentrations. Fast magnetic recovery of the sorbent within 30&#8197;s was achieved. Regeneration of the sorbent for repeated use was demonstrated over four cycles. The technology is promising for large&#8208;scale implementation of PFAS capture.







Abstract
Efficient removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated waters is urgently needed to safeguard public and environmental health. In this work, novel magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbents were designed to allow efficient capture of PFAS and fast magnetic recovery of the sorbed material. The new sorbent has superior PFAS removal efficiency compared with the commercially available activated carbon and ion&#8208;exchange resins. The removal of the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches &gt;99&#8201;% within 30&#8197;s, and the estimated sorption capacity was 219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the Langmuir model. Robust and efficient regeneration of the magnetic polymer sorbent was confirmed by the repeated sorption and desorption of GenX over four cycles. The sorption of multiple PFAS in two real contaminated water matrices at an environmentally relevant concentration (1&#8197;ppb) shows &gt;95&#8201;% removal for the majority of PFAS tested in this study.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Crotylation of Alcohol Proelectrophiles via Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Auto&#8208;Transfer Mediated by Methylallene and Butadiene</title>

Ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS&#8208;catalysts affect anti&#8208;crotylation of primary alcohols mediated by methylallene or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to provide polyketide propionate motifs. These C&#8722;C bond formations are byproduct&#8208;free and can be conducted in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;bound ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS complexes catalyze the redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;C coupling of primary alcohols with methylallene (1,2&#8208;butadiene) or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to form products of anti&#8208;crotylation with good to excellent levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Distinct from other methods, direct crotylation of primary alcohols in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols is possible, enabling generation of spirastrellolide&#8197;B (C9&#8211;C15) and leucascandrolide&#8197;A (C9&#8211;C15) substructures in significantly fewer steps than previously possible.

         <title>Deracemization through Sequential Photoredox&#8208;Neutral and Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stoichiometric reagent&#8208;free deracemization strategy based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis is developed. The strategy offers precise access to biologically important &#945;&#8208;amino esters and variants with high yields and ee values. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by enantiocontrol of the protonation as the stereocentre&#8208;forming step. The method is also viable for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;&#8208;amino esters.







Abstract
Catalytic deracemization is an ideal synthetic strategy due to its formally perfect atom utilization. Asymmetric photocatalysis has been appreciated as a promising tool to accomplish this attractive reaction pattern in an economical fashion, but it remains underdeveloped. Here, we report a new platform based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis, allowing efficient and modular optical enrichment of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and other valuable analogues. Two single&#8208;electron transfer processes between the photocatalyst and the substrates serve to provide the key prochiral intermediates, and the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst mediates enantioselective protonation to reconstitute a stereogenic C&#8722;H bond. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by the enantiofacial differentiation effect during the stereocentre&#8208;forming step.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Iodine Uptake by a Molecular Host&#8901;Guest Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrated and molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystal (PHGC&#8208;1) made of cucurbit[8]uril and trimethoxybenzylazaphosphatrane can adsorb iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of a)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, b)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and c)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are very attractive attributes of this new generation of energy&#8208;saving porous materials.







Abstract
Recently, porous organic crystals (POC) based on macrocycles have shown exceptional sorption and separation properties. Yet, the impact of guest presence inside a macrocycle prior to adsorption has not been studied. Here we show that the inclusion of trimethoxybenzyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane in the macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) affords molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystals (PHGC&#8208;1) with radically new properties. Unactivated hydrated PHGC&#8208;1 adsorbed iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of (i)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, (ii)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and (iii)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are attractive attributes for decreasing the energy costs. 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY were instrumental for monitoring the H2O/I2 exchange. PHGC&#8208;1 crystals are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and I2&#8208;doped crystals showed markedly different second harmonic generation (SHG), which suggests that iodine doping could be used to modulate the non&#8208;linear optical properties of porous organic crystals.

         <title>Chromium/Photoredox Dual Catalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Benzylic Alcohols, Isochromanones, 1,2&#8208;Oxy Alcohols and 1,2&#8208;Thio Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;benzylic alcohols, functionalized isochromanones, 1,2&#8208;oxy alcohols and 1,2&#8208;thio alcohols has been successfully achieved by employing a dual catalytic method combining chromium chemistry and photoredox catalysis. This presents a methodology under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, a Cr/Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed general synthetic strategy to access &#945;&#8208;benzylic alcohols, isochromanones, oxy alcohols and thio alcohols is unveiled. Alkylation of aldehydes being a crucial C&#8722;C bond forming reaction, designing competent catalytic systems would render an attractive and decorated set of diverse alcohol motifs. Considering the challenges associated with classical organometallic chemistry, the strategy of dual catalysis is applied here to generate diverse alcohol motifs in a mild and efficient manner. The amalgamation of photocatalysis with chromium chemistry is chosen for this purpose to generate an environment with low basicity and thus, high chemoselectivity. With alkyl silanes as preferred coupling partners, this catalytic setup produces a broad substrate scope with an excellent functional group tolerance and displays a facile scale&#8208;up as well. Its application towards biologically relevant molecules and product diversification contributes to the synthetic utility of this method.

         <title>Glycan Modulation of Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor&#8208;1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work provides a new insight into insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R), which is preferentially inhibited by smaller heparan sulfate chains, e.g., HS06, in contrast to longer polysaccharidic chains, e.g., HS36, which are devoid of the inhibition function.







Abstract
The insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays critical roles in cancer. Microarray, computational, thermodynamic, and cellular imaging studies reveal that activation of IGF&#8208;1R by its cognate ligand IGF1 is inhibited by shorter, soluble heparan sulfate (HS) sequences (e.g., HS06), whereas longer polymeric chains do not inhibit the RTK, a phenomenon directly opposed to the traditional relationship known for GAG&#8208;protein systems. The inhibition arises from smaller oligosaccharides binding in a unique pocket in the IGF&#8208;1R ectodomain, which competes with the natural cognate ligand IGF1. This work presents a highly interesting observation on preferential and competing inhibition of IGF&#8208;1R by smaller sequences, whereas polysaccharides are devoid of this function. These insights will be of major value to glycobiologists and anti&#8208;cancer drug discoverers.

         <dc:description>
A sensitive and reversible labeling strategy enabling global mapping of the core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome on cell surfaces is presented in the Research Article (e202206802) by Hu Zhou, Liuqing Wen, and co&#8208;workers. The labeled probe can be further cleaved enzymatically after capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry.

Sequential electron transfer leading to the generation of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states in the order of 20&#8197;ms is demonstrated in multimodular electron donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids by Francis D'Souza and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202212474), as a promising functional material for light energy conversion. Strategic positioning of diameter&#8208;sorted, single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes, BODIPY, and C60 promoted electron and hole transfer events, slowing down the process of charge recombination, as demonstrated by pump&#8211;probe studies covering wide temporal and spatial time scales.

Crownphyrins are macrocycles combining the structural features of porphyrin and crown ethers. The molecular architecture renders them an intriguing class of hosts capable of binding neutral and ionic guests. The presence of imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables the unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes reported by Bartosz Szyszko and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202211671).

         <title>Siloxane&#8208;Based Organosilicon Materials in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane&#8208;based organosilicon materials display important new functions, such as a wide electrochemical window, resistance to extreme temperatures, long cycling life in energy storage systems, high thermostability, fire resistance and flexibility. Such materials have been integrated in electrodes, separators and electrolyte interfaces for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors.







Abstract
Siloxane&#8208;based molecular material, by virtue of its unique chemical structure, thermal and electrochemical properties, has triggered tremendous research interest and sparked a revolution for energy storage in the past years. Siloxanes and their analogues are generally demonstrated to be more environmentally friendly, durable, and safer when employed to reconstruct the nano&#8208;micro surface structure of electrodes, separators, and their interfaces with electrolytes. To better understand the recent and comprehensive achievement of siloxane&#8208;based materials in energy storage, a systematic summary is necessary to provide important clues, aiming at achieving better electrochemical properties. In this Minireview, siloxane materials are presented comprehensively and systematically in terms of molecule design, functionality, and unique superiority for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors. The challenges, perspectives, and future directions of siloxane&#8208;based organosilicon materials are put forward for higher performance and wider application in electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>[FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase In Vitro Maturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of an active [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (HydA), the most efficient enzyme for H2 production, requires the synthesis of a complex organometallic metal center, the H&#8208;cluster, where the reversible reduction of protons to H2 occurs. In vitro HydA maturation systems involving the three maturation proteins HydE, HydF and HydG have contributed significantly to a better understanding of the activation mechanism of this fascinating enzyme.







Abstract
The [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase H&#8208;cluster is a complex organometallic cofactor whose assembly and installation requires three dedicated accessory proteins referred to as HydE, HydF, and HydG. The roles of these maturases and the precise mechanisms by which they synthesize and insert the H&#8208;cluster are not fully understood. This Minireview will focus on new insights into the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase maturation process that have been provided by in vitro approaches in which the biosynthetic pathway has been partially or fully reconstructed using semisynthetic and enzyme&#8208;based approaches. Specifically, the application of these in vitro, semisynthetic, and fully defined approaches has shed light on the roles of individual maturation enzymes, the nature of H&#8208;cluster assembly intermediates, the molecular precursors of H&#8208;cluster ligands, and the sequence of steps involved in [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase maturation.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Selective Amide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the selective activation of amides has flourished over the last decades. In the past four years, this area has become a rapidly developing domain. This Minireview aims to highlight the breakthroughs in amide activation achieved since 2018, with a focus on significant advances in electrophilic and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed amide activation, as well as other strategies on amide activation and functionalisation.







Abstract
In contrast to ketones and carboxylic esters, amides are classically seen as comparatively unreactive members of the carbonyl family, owing to their unique structural and electronic features. However, recent decades have seen the emergence of research programmes focused on the selective activation of amides under mild conditions. In the past four years, this area has continued to rapidly develop, with new advances coming in at a fast pace. Several novel activation strategies have been demonstrated as effective tools for selective amide activation, enabling transformations that are at once synthetically useful and mechanistically intriguing. This Minireview comprises recent advances in the field, highlighting new trends and breakthroughs in what could be called a new age of amide activation.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100&#8197;years after Paul Ehrlich's vision of the &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;, the major challenges in drug delivery remain unchanged: 1)&#8197;controlling pharmacokinetic and biodistribution drug distribution and clearance in the blood; 2)&#8197;solubilizing hydrophobic agents, and 3)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. This Review describes new alternatives for synthetic drug delivery systems for systemic applications.







Abstract
Poor water solubility and low bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction in the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small&#8208;molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i)&#8197;controlling drug distribution and clearance in the blood; (ii)&#8197;solubilizing poorly water&#8208;soluble agents, and (iii)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several polymer&#8208;based systems have addressed the first two demands and have been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This Review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new polymer&#8208;based delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.

         <dc:description>
Despite decades of studies, advances in the design of catalysts at the laboratory scale and insights into the underlying ECO2R processes have not yet led to high deployment rates in industry. This Review discusses practical challenges in the industrial chain that hamper the scaling&#8208;up deployment of ECO2R technology. In addition, insights are provided to accelerate the development of ECO2R technology.







Abstract
The global temperature increase must be limited to below 1.5&#8201;&#176;C to alleviate the worst effects of climate change. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECO2R) to generate chemicals and feedstocks is considered one of the most promising technologies to cut CO2 emission at an industrial level. However, despite decades of studies, advances at the laboratory scale have not yet led to high industrial deployment rates. This Review discusses practical challenges in the industrial chain that hamper the scaling&#8208;up deployment of the ECO2R technology. Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of about 100&#8201;% and current densities above 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 have been achieved for the ECO2R to CO/HCOOH, and the stability of the electrolysis system has been prolonged to 2000&#8197;h. For ECO2R to C2H4, the maximum FE is over 80&#8201;%, and the highest current density has reached the A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 level. Thus, it is believed that ECO2R may have reached the stage for scale&#8208;up. We aim to provide insights that can accelerate the development of the ECO2R technology.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Arylation of Alkenylsulfonium Salts with Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed divergent arylation of alkenyl thianthrenium salts with arylboroxines which allows switchable synthesis of both terminal and internal alkene products in a highly selective manner is reported. The use of a diene ligand guides the reaction toward cine&#8208;arylation affording terminal alkenes, while the use of a phosphine ligand switches the reaction to ipso&#8208;arylation exclusively giving internal alkenes.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylated Quinoids by Organocatalytic Tandem N&#8208;Arylation/Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed process was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;aryl quinoid atropisomers through direct C&#8722;N bond formation. In this way, a broad range of functionalized N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers containing an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring were constructed in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Diarylamines and related scaffolds are ubiquitous atropisomeric chemotypes in biologically active natural products. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these axially chiral compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report that a BINOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) successfully catalyzed the atroposelective coupling of quinone esters and anilines through direct C&#8722;N bond formation to afford N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers with an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring in good yields and enantioselectivities with the quinone ester as both the electrophile and the oxidant. A gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the utility of this synthetic protocol. Moreover, this methodology provides a platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse secondary amine atropisomers by nucleophilic addition.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] Alkaloids: A Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Spirocyclization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct spirocyclization approach was adopted for the concise chemical synthesis of a class of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids. Stereochemically complementary spirocyclic systems could be generated by manipulation of the spirocyclization pathway to favor the kinetic or thermodynamic product.







Abstract
A direct spirocyclization approach for the chemical synthesis of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids is reported. The absolute stereochemistry was introduced by a desymmetrizing Dieckmann condensation, and the relative stereochemistry was controlled by the manipulation of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways of the spirocyclization. By contrast to the biogenetic proposal involving the diester&#8208;type alkaloid as the precursor, we demonstrate that chemically a common lactone&#8208;type intermediate could bridge the chemical synthesis of this class of natural products.

         <title>Native Top&#8208;Down Mass Spectrometry Reveals a Role for Interfacial Glycans on Therapeutic Cytokine and Hormone Assemblies</title>

         <dc:description>
Native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) reveals subunit composition and glycan heterogeneity of therapeutic glycoprotein assemblies. By comparing the measured oligomer proteoforms with theoretical models, reconstituted from the dissociated subunits, we show that the interfacial glycan influences complex stability.







Abstract
Oligomerization and glycosylation modulate therapeutic glycoprotein stability and efficacy. The interplay between these two critical attributes on therapeutic glycoproteins, is however often hard to define. Here, we present a native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) approach to assess the glycosylation status of therapeutic cytokine and hormone assemblies and relate interfacial glycan occupancy to complex stability. We found that interfacial O&#8208;glycan stabilizes tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; trimer. On the contrary, interferon&#8208;&#946;1a dimerization is independent of glycosylation. Moreover, we discovered a unique distribution of N&#8208;glycans on the follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone &#945; subunit. We found that the interfacial N&#8208;glycan, at Asn52 of the &#945; subunit, interacts extensively with the &#946; subunit to regulate the dimer assembly. Overall, we have exemplified a method to link glycosylation with assembly status, for cytokines and hormones, critical for informing optimal stability and bioavailability.

         <title>General Access to N&#8722;CF3 Secondary Amines and Their Transformation to N&#8722;CF3 Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and mild method for the generation of HF from triethylsilane and silver fluoride leads to a highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines. Novel N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides were constructed from these promising amine building blocks and sulfonyl bromides in an unprecedented route.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds through fluorination or trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;containing compounds has been extensively investigated. However, general access to N&#8722;CF3 compounds simply from N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines is hampered by the challenging preparation and instability of these amines, as well as a much lower reactivity due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl moiety. Herein, we report a general and highly efficient synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines with excellent isolated yields via the addition of the in situ generated difluoromethyl imine (R&#8722;N=CF2) intermediates with hydrogen fluoride, which is mildly produced by triethylsilane and silver fluoride. N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides, highly desirable but scarce at present, are easily accessible from these valuable building blocks through an unprecedented route. This study will bring new vitality to the synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds.

&lt;p&gt;A new and mild method for the generation of HF from triethylsilane and silver fluoride leads to a highly efficient one-pot synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; secondary amines. Novel &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sulfonamides were constructed from these promising amine building blocks and sulfonyl bromides in an unprecedented route.

Solvothermal reaction of 3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;hexahydroxybiphenyl with Fe2+ generates a MOF with an unusual topology, comprising 2D secondary building units of mixed&#8208;valence Fe2+/Fe3+ sites, which enable strong electronic interactions.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with a rare two&#8208;dimensional (2D) secondary building unit (SBU). The SBU comprises mixed&#8208;valent Fe2+ and Fe3+ metal ions bridged by oxygen atoms pertaining to the polytopic ligand 3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;hexahydroxybiphenyl, which also define the iron&#8208;oxide 2D layers. Overall, the anionic framework exhibits rare topology and evidences strong electronic communication between the mixed&#8208;valence iron sites. These results highlight the importance of dimensionality control of MOF SBUs for discovering new topologies in reticular chemistry, and especially for improving electronic communication within the MOF skeleton.

         <title>Construction of Catalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Redox&#8208;Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with bifunctional roles in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been prepared by integrating redox&#8208;active sites into the cobalt&#8208;porphyrin frameworks. The COFs have high electrochemical surface areas and electron transfer abilities, and have good catalytic activities in oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Construction of catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. In this work, we have first constructed bifunctional COFs towards ORR and OER by integrating diarylamine derivatives into the Co&#8208;porphyrin based frameworks. Both of the new COFs (CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF and CoTAPP&#8208;BDTA&#8208;COF) have good ordered structures, high surface areas, and robust chemical stability. The diarylamine units, as a typical electron donor and redox&#8208;active cores, promote intramolecular electron transport along the frameworks and improve the electrochemically active surface areas. Thus, the COFs showed higher catalytic activities than that of the COF without redox&#8208;active units. CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF had a halfwave potential of 0.80&#8197;V towards ORR, and delieved an overpotential of 420&#8197;mV for OER in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. The theoretical calculation revealed introducing diarylamine unites improved the oxygen electrocatalysis.

Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co layered double oxide yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) are designed as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a two&#8208;step conversion strategy. Owing to the enhanced mass transport of the structure and the modulated chemical environment of metal species, the obtained NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER with good stability.







Abstract
The exploration of earth&#8208;abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a self&#8208;engaged strategy to fabricate a yolk&#8208;shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal&#8211;organic framework, Co&#8208;Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) yolk&#8208;shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF&#8208;67 building blocks are transformed into Ni&#8208;Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co LDH yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) through an ion&#8208;exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 49.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acids: A Multifunctional Monooxygenase Delivers a Complex and Highly Branched Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nodulisporic acids are structurally complex potent antiinsectan natural products produced by the filamentous fungus Hypoxylon pulicicidum. A gene cluster, consisting of 13 genes, has been identified and biosynthetic machinery functionally characterised. This work reveals a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple nodulisporic acid congeners. The variation arises due to the action of a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ.







Abstract
Nodulisporic acids (NAs) are structurally complex potent antiinsectan indole diterpenes. We previously reported the biosynthetic gene cluster for these metabolites in Hypoxylon pulicicidum and functionally characterised the first five steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Here we reveal a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple end products through expression of cluster components in Penicillium paxilli. We show that seven additional cluster&#8208;encoded gene products comprise the biosynthetic machinery that elaborate precursor NAF in this highly branched pathway. The combined action of these enzymes delivers 37 NA congeners including four major end products, NAA, NAA1, NAA2 and NAA4. The plethora of intermediates arises due to modification of the carboxylated prenyl tail by a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ, a pivotal branchpoint enzyme which produces four distinct biosynthetic products giving rise to the complex metabolic grid that characterises NA biosynthesis.

         <title>A Cation Concentration Gradient Approach to Tune the Selectivity and Activity of CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation concentration gradient approach is developed to promote the activity and tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction on three archetypical catalysts. This approach provides a new strategy to break the linear scaling relationship of the binding energies of different catalytic intermediates via cation induced dipole&#8208;field interactions.







Abstract
The linear scaling relationship of the binding energies of different intermediates limits the catalyst performance in CO2 electroreduction. Here we demonstrate a cation concentration gradient strategy to promote the activity and tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction, thereby breaking the scaling relationship. In optimal concentrations of the potassium acetate (KAc) electrolyte, Cu, Ag and In catalysts deliver current densities that are 7.1, 3.2, 2.7&#8197;times higher than those obtained in 0.5&#8197;M KAc for C2H4, CO, and formate production, respectively. Increasing the concentration of KAc also changes the selectivity from CO to formate on Ag, and from CO to C2 products on Cu. In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy and computational simulations reveal that the binding energies of intermediates are changed at different electrolyte concentrations, which is due to a local electrostatic interaction modulated by potassium cations at the electrode surface.

         <title>Complexed Semiconductor Cores Activate Hexaniobate Ligands as Nucleophilic Sites for Solar&#8208;Light Reduction of CO2 by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkably rapid CO2 reduction by solar light and water is achieved using molecular analogs of metal&#8208;oxide intercalated niobate nanosheets.







Abstract
Although pure and functionalized solid&#8208;state polyniobates such as layered perovskites and niobate nanosheets are photocatalysts for renewable&#8208;energy processes, analogous reactions by molecular polyoxoniobate cluster&#8208;anions are nearly absent from the literature. We now report that under simulated solar light, hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anion encapsulated 30&#8208;NiII&#8208;ion &#8220;fragments&#8221; of surface&#8208;protonated cubic&#8208;phase&#8208;like NiO cores activate the hexaniobate ligands towards CO2 reduction by water. Photoexcitation of the NiO cores promotes charge&#8208;transfer reduction of NbV to NbIV, increasing electron density at bridging oxo atoms of Nb&#8208;&#956;&#8208;O&#8208;Nb linkages that bind and convert CO2 to CO. Photogenerated NiO &#8220;holes&#8221; simultaneously oxidize water to dioxygen. The findings point to molecular complexation of suitable semiconductor &#8220;fragments&#8221; as a general method for utilizing electron&#8208;dense polyoxoniobate anions as nucleophilic photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light driven activation and reduction of small molecules.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap as a Critical Molecular Descriptor for Predicting Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) is proposed as a critical molecular descriptor to predict organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiency. An unprecedented prediction accuracy is achieved from data&#8208;driven machine learning when two conventional descriptors are combined, optical gap (Eg) and driving force (&#916;EDA), enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of efficient OPV materials.







Abstract
In contrast to the inorganic and perovskite solar cells, organic photovoltaics (OPV) depend on a series of charge generation and recombination processes, which complicates molecular design to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we first propose the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) as a critical molecular descriptor for predicting the PCE considering that minimizing &#916;EST is beneficial to simultaneously reduce voltage loss and triplet recombination. Remarkably, the results from data&#8208;driven machine learning verify that the prediction accuracy of the &#916;EST (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.72) is apparently superior to that of two commonly used molecular descriptors in OPV, i.e., the optical gap (r=0.65) and the driving force (r=0.53). Moreover, an impressive prediction accuracy of r=0.81 is achieved just by combining the three descriptors. This work paves the way toward rapid and precise screening of efficient OPV materials.

         <title>Engineering of Pyroelectric Crystals Decoupled from Piezoelectricity as Illustrated by Doped &#945;&#8208;Glycine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
From symmetry considerations, a pyroelectric crystal is expected to be piezoelectric at least in its polar direction. This work demonstrates a synthetic method based on enantio&#8208;specific co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals. By choosing an appropriate co&#8208;dopant with coincident contribution to pyroelectricity and opposing contributions to piezoelectricity, one can enhance the first while suppressing the second, thus breaking the linkage between the effects.







Abstract
Design of pyroelectric crystals decoupled from piezoelectricity is not only a topic of scientific curiosity but also demonstrates effects in principle that have the potential to be technologically advantageous. Here we report a new method for the design of such materials. Thus, the co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals with tailor&#8208;made guest molecules, as illustrated by the doping of &#945;&#8208;glycine with different amino acids (Threonine, Alanine and Serine). The polarization of those crystals displays two distinct contributions, one arising from the difference in dipole moments between guest and host and the other from the displacement of host molecules from their symmetry&#8208;related positions. These contributions exhibit different temperature dependences and response to mechanical deformation. Thus, providing a proof of concept for the ability to design pyroelectric materials with reduced piezoelectric coefficient (d22) to a minimal value, below the resolution limit of the method (&lt;0.005&#8197;pm/V).

         <title>Sequential and Reversible Phase Transformations in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Sb&#8208;based Halides towards Multiple Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the sequential and reversible phase transformation and photoluminescence switching of orange (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#8901;H2O crystals, red (MTP)2SbBr5 crystals and (MTP)2SbBr5 glass with near&#8208;infrared emission. Utilizing their luminescence switching nature accompanied by reversible phase transformations, we achieved multiple and repeatable anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides have drawn increasing attention due to the attractive structure dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Here, we report two new 0D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Sb&#8208;based halides, (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#8901;H2O (MTP=Methyltriphenylphosphonium, crystal&#8197;1) and (MTP)2SbBr5 (crystal&#8197;2), featuring a reversible structural phase transformation and tunable orange and red emissions upon dehydration and rehydration of H2O molecules. Intriguingly, a subsequent heat treatment further enables the formation of glassy state (MTP)2SbBr5 (glass&#8197;3) with near&#8208;infrared luminescence, moreover, a sequential reverse phase transformation from glass&#8197;3 to crystal&#8197;2 and 1 is triggered by acetonitrile and water vapor stepwise. The anti&#8208;counterfeiting demo based on the tunable and reversible PL switching is finally achieved and thus the phase structure engineering in 0D metal halides expands their multiple applications in optical fields.

         <title>A Triplet Label Extends Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy from Pico&#8208; to Microseconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short vibrational lifetimes limit monitoring molecular dynamics by conventional IR spectroscopy to &#8776;15&#8197;ps. We extend this window &#8776;50&#8201;000 fold by introducing the novel Fourier&#8208;transform VIPER pulse sequence with the triplet label 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone. Slow processes up to 1&#8197;&#956;s (e.g., in glassy matrices, liquid crystals, or solvent dynamics) are now accessible.







Abstract
In conventional two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, the inherently short vibrational lifetimes limit the time window to observe molecular dynamics typically to tens of picoseconds. The rather complex dynamics of organized molecular systems (e.g., glass formers, polymers, membranes, proteins), however, span a wide range of timescales from femto&#8208; to microseconds and beyond. Vibrationally Promoted Electronic Resonance (VIPER) 2D&#8208;IR negates the limitations of 2D&#8208;IR spectroscopy, for its signal decays with the electronic lifetime. Here, we present 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone as the first VIPER 2D&#8208;IR probe to exploit intersystem crossing, thereby covering even the microsecond timescale. We achieved the required signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and resolution by introducing the Fourier&#8208;transform approach to the VIPER 2D&#8208;IR pulse sequence. Now, we are in a position to monitor dynamics via spectral diffusion several orders of magnitude beyond the vibrational lifetime of 2D&#8208;IR labels.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Labeling of Difluoromethyl and Trifluoromethyl Groups via Monoselective C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups using frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18. The method utilizes the target compound as the starting material simplifying the radiosynthetic protocol for labeling pharmaceuticals and radiotracers that already contain CF3 or CF2H groups.







Abstract
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups in a broad range of chemical settings (aryl, oxide, sulfide). The method utilizes frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18 in a two&#8208;step defluorination/radiofluorination process, and as such can utilize the target compounds as starting materials. The radiotracer precursors can be isolated as stable salts prior to radiofluorination. The method delivers good radiochemical yields and molar activities (up to 35.2&#177;6.5&#8201;% non&#8208;decay corrected isolated activity yields and 12.0&#177;1.7&#8197;GBq&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1 molar activities) and is shown to be applicable to biologically relevant compounds. The ability to utilize the target compound as the starting material and the synthetic simplicity of the method coupled with the ever&#8208;increasing use of CF3 and CF2H groups in pharmaceuticals makes this method attractive for drug and radiotracer development.

         <title>A Dislocated Twin&#8208;Locking Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Configuration for Efficient Delayed Fluorescence with Multiple Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locking a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) by two spirofluorene groups has led to a rigid dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) configuration that exhibits multiple through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). This emitter shows both efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
Organic materials featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states are advantageous for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), although the realization of multiple TSCT systems remains challenging. Herein, a rigid molecule with a three&#8208;dimensional dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor configuration has been developed by a linking biphenazine (2PXZ) donor and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor through the twin&#8208;locking of two spiro&#8208;fluorene bridges. The twin&#8208;locking construction with multiple TSCT effects suppresses the intramolecular rotations of various segments in 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ, leading to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference, a fast reverse intersystem crossing process, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This material simultaneously possesses the capabilities of TADF and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The device employing 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ as a dopant displays an optimal external quantum efficiency of 27.1&#8201;% and a low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

With electricity as green oxidant, a catalytic amount of benzoquinone (BQ) was used as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) in palladium&#8208;based electrocatalysis to provide highly efficient access to &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactone skeletons in an undivided cell. This represents the first successful example of an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of allenes.







Abstract
Herein, we report an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation&#8208;carbocyclization of enallenols to afford &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones, which proceeds with excellent chemoselectivity. Interestingly, electrocatalysis was found to have an accelerating effect on the rate of the tandem process, leading to a more efficient reaction than that under chemical redox conditions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Toxicity ZnSe/ZnS Quantum Dots as Potent Photoreductants and Triplet Sensitizers for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>

ZnSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots, surface&#8208;functionalized with electron or triplet&#8208;energy relay molecules, function as potent photosensitizers to address challenging organic transformations.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can photocatalyze diverse organic reactions. However, reported QD&#8208;photocatalysts often contain highly&#8208;toxic elements Cd or Pb, and have not surpassed prototypical transition&#8208;metal complexes in terms of their photoredox power or excited&#8208;state energy. Here we report low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs as potent visible photocatalysts to drive challenging organic transformations. To overcome the limitation of short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the QDs, we functionalize their surfaces with benzophenone ligands which can rapidly extract electrons from photoexcited QDs and sustain long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. The benzophenone anions function as potent electron relay to drive dehalogenation of aryl chlorides and additive&#8208;free polymerization of acrylates. Alternatively, the QDs are functionalized with biphenyl ligands to store energy in long&#8208;lived, energetic triplets, enabling [2+2] homo&#8208;cycloaddition of styrene and cycloaddition of carbonyls with alkenes.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks by Wittig Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Wittig reaction is demonstrated as novel synthetic strategy for the synthesis of crystalline unsubstituted vinylene&#8208;linked 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks through the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity. Ultrafast THz spectroscopy discloses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art charge&#8208;transport properties of as&#8208;prepared V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs as a result of electron delocalization in the fully conjugated frameworks.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have shown great promise in electronics and optoelectronics. However, only a few reactions for V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs have been developed hitherto. Besides the kinetically low reversibility of C=C bond formation, another underlying issue facing the synthesis of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs is the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity to ensure the appropriate symmetry of 2D frameworks. Here, we tailor the E/Z selectivity of the Wittig reaction by employing a proper catalyst (i.e., Cs2CO3) to obtain more stable intermediates and elevating the temperature across the reaction barrier. Subsequently, the Wittig reaction is innovatively utilized for the synthesis of four crystalline V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs by combining aldehydes and ylides. Importantly, the efficient conjugation and decent crystallinity of the resultant V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs are demonstrated by their high charge carrier mobilities over 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, as revealed by non&#8208;contact terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Simple Ketones Enabled by Activation of Unstrained C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed directing group&#8208;free formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction was established between simple ketones and arylboronates based on activation of unstrained C&#8722;C bonds. The key to the success of this reaction is a nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.







Abstract
The use of ketones as electrophiles to couple with arylboronic acid derivatives via C&#8722;C bond activation has become a significant progress in the area of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction, in which a permanent or temporary directing group is often required to promote the activation of the unstrained C&#8722;C bond via oxidative addition. Herein, we disclosed the first example of directing group free formal SMC reaction of simple ketones with arylboronates via Rh&#8208;catalyzed unstrained C&#8722;C bond activation. A wide range of simple ketones, including aryl alkyl ketones, diaryl ketones and aryl perfluoroalkyl ketones, can serve as electrophiles to participate in the SMC reaction with aryl or perfluoroalkyl as the leaving group. The key to the success of this reaction is by means of nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.

         <title>Selective Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Catalyzed Depolymerization of Nylon&#8208;6 to &#949;&#8209;Caprolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nylon&#8208;6 is selectively depolymerized to the parent monomer &#949;&#8209;caprolactam by the readily accessible and commercially available lanthanide trisamido catalysts Ln(N(TMS)2)3 (Ln = lanthanide). The depolymerization process is solvent&#8208;free, near quantitative, highly selective, and operates at the lowest Nylon&#8208;6 to &#949;&#8209;caprolactam depolymerization temperature reported to date. The catalytic activity of the different lanthanide trisamides scales with the Ln3+ ionic radius, and this process is effective with post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 as well as with Nylon&#8208;6 + polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate mixtures. Experimental kinetic data and theoretical (DFT) mechanistic analyses suggest initial deprotonation of a Nylon terminal amido N&#8208;H bond, which covalently binds the catalyst to the polymer, followed by a chain&#8208;end back&#8208;biting process in which &#949;&#8208;caprolactam units are sequentially extruded from the chain end.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Unipolymer Monolayer with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of crystalline polymer with a well&#8208;defined orientated state and a two&#8208;dimensional crystalline size beyond a micrometer will be essential to achieve the highest physical feature of polymer material but remain challenging. Herein, we show the synthesis of the crystalline unipolymer monolayer with an unusual ultrahigh modulus that is higher than the ITO substrate and high conductance by simultaneous electrosynthesis and manipulation. We find that the polymer monolayer has fully extended in the vertical and unidirectional orientation, which is proposed to approach their theoretically highest density, modulus, and conductivity among all aggregation formations of the current polymer. The modulus and current density can reach 40 and 1000 times higher than their amorphous counterpart. It is also found that these monolayers exhibit the bias&#8208; and length&#8208;dependent multiple charge states and asymmetrically negative differential resistance (NDR) effect, indicating that this unique molecular tailoring and ordering design is promising for multilevel resistive memory devices. Our work demonstrates the creation of a crystalline polymer monolayer for approaching the physical limit of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating Electron Leakage of Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interfacial stability is highly responsible for the longevity and safety of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) growth would deteriorate its stability. Essentially, the SEI growth is associated with the electron leakage behavior, yet few efforts have tried to suppress the SEI growth, from the perspective of mitigating electron leakage. Herein, we built two kinds of SEI layers with distinct growth behaviors, via the additive strategy. The SEI physicochemical features (morphology and componential information) and SEI electronic properties (LUMO level, band gap, electron work function) were investigated elaborately. Experimental and calculational analyses showed that, the SEI layer with suppressed growth delivers both the low electron driving force and the high electron insulation ability. Thus, the electron leakage is mitigated, which restrains the continuous SEI growth, and favors the interface stability with enhanced electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Cradle&#8208;to&#8208;Cradle Polyolefin Lifecycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient chemical depolymerization of waste polyolefins to monomers remains an unsolved challenge, while it could be an effective means to avoid further waste accumulation in the environment and generate economic benefits. In a recent publication by Conk et al., polyethylene (PE) is converted to propylene, the second most used monomer in the polymer industry. The conversion is achieved via a tandem catalysis approach in which partially unsaturated PE chains react with ethylene to generate propylene with yields as high as 87%. The study is a first proof of concept showcasing a selective chemical depolymerization of PE to a monomer. Future research is expected to focus on the catalyst optimization, process design, and compatibility with contaminated and multi&#8208;polymer waste streams.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Complete Photocycle that Powers a Large Stokes Shift Red Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large Stokes shift (LSS) red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are highly desirable for bioimaging advances. The RFP mKeima, with coexisting cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers, holds significance as an archetypal system for LSS emission due to excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT), yet the mechanisms remain elusive. We implemented femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and various time&#8208;resolved electronic spectroscopies, aided by quantum calculations, to dissect the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;mKeima photocycle from ESPT, isomerization, to ground&#8208;state proton transfer in solution. This work manifests the power of FSRS with global analysis to resolve Raman fingerprints of intermediate states. Importantly, the deprotonated trans&#8208;isomer governs LSS emission at 620 nm, while the deprotonated cis&#8208;isomer&#8217;s 520 nm emission is weak due to an ultrafast cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization. Complementary spectroscopic techniques as a table&#8208;top toolset are thus essential to study photochemistry in physiological environments.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;stabilized diborynes of the form LBBL (L = NHC or CAAC) induce rapid, high yielding, intermolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8211;H borylation at N&#8208;heterocycles at room temperature. A simple pyridyldiborene is formed when an NHC&#8208;stabilized diboryne is combined with pyridine, while a CAAC&#8208;stabilized diboryne leads to activation of two pyridine molecules to give a tricyclic alkylideneborane, which can be forced to undergo a further H&#8208;shift resulting in a zwitterionic, doubly benzo&#8208;fused 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinine by heating.

         <title>A novel electrode for value&#8208;generating anode reactions in water electrolyzers at industrial current densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen generated in electrolyzers is discussed as a key element in future energy scenarios, but oxygen evolution as the standard anode reaction is a complex multi&#8208;step reaction requiring a high overpotential while it does not add value&#8208;the oxygen is typically released into the atmosphere. Alternative anode reactions which can proceed at similar current densities as the hydrogen evolution are therefore of highest interest. We have discovered a high&#8208;performance electrode based on earth abundant elements synthesized in the presence of H2O2, which is able to sustain current densities of close to 1 A/cm2 for the oxidation of many organic molecules, which are partly needed at high production volumes. Such anode reactions could generate additional revenue streams, which help to solve one of the most important problems in the transition to renewable energy systems, i.e. the cost of hydrogen electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Catenanes for&#160;Recognition of Alkali Metal/Halide Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic homo[2]catenanes were prepared by discrete Na+ template&#8208;directed assembly of oligo(ethylene glycol) units derived from XB donor&#8208;containing macrocycles and acyclic bis&#8208;azide precursors, followed by a Cu(I) mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition macrocyclisation reaction. Extensive 1H NMR spectroscopic studies show that the [2]catenane hosts exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, wherein XB&#8208;mediated halide recognition is enhanced by alkali metal cation pre&#8208;complexation. Notably, subtle changes in the catenanes&#8216; oligo(ethylene glycol) chain length dramatically alters ion binding affinity, stoichiometry, complexation mode and conformational dynamics. Solution phase and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies provide evidence for competing host&#8208;separated and direct contact ion&#8208;pair binding modes. We further demonstrate the [2]catenanes are capable of extracting solid alkali metal halide salts into organic media.</dc:description>

         <title>How Crystal Symmetry Dictates Non&#8208;Local Vibrational Circular Dichroism in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) is becoming increasingly popular because it can be used to determine not only absolute configurations, but also the absolute structure of an entire chiral crystal. However, the interpretation of chiroptical spectra in solid&#8208;state remains a challenge in modern&#160; vibrational spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate the significant effect of a single twofold screw axis on the solid&#8208;state VCD spectrum in a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of monoclinic crystals of (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;indanol, which belong to the P21 space group. Even though the space group itself is achiral, the presence of a single proper symmetry operation has an important impact on the VCD spectrum. Thanks to recent developments in modelling solid&#8208;state VCD under periodic boundary con ditions, we can distinguish between contributions originating from the chiral unit itself and those stemming from the chiral crystal packing. While IR absorption does not depend much on the space group&#8217;s symmetry, the situation is very different for VCD where new&#160; entirely non&#8208;local patterns arise. We discuss the two different mechanisms that give rise to non&#8208;local VCD, namely, gauge transport and direct coupling, and analyse their contribution to the generation of the VCD spectrum in the light of the P21 symmetry of the crystal.</dc:description>
