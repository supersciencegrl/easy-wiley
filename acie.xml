         <title>Anion&#8208;Enriched Solvation Engineering of Ester&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Sodium Metal Batteries at &#8722;40 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address poor low&#8208;temperature performance of ester&#8208;based electrolytes in sodium metal batteries, we introduce phosphate ester (trimethyl phosphate, TEP) as a co&#8208;solvent. With low melting point, low viscosity, and low&#160;polarity, TEP modifies the solvation structure at &#8722;40 &#176;C, reducing de&#8208;solvation energy barriers and improving interfacial stability. This electrolyte enables Na||Na symmetric cells to cycle stably for 1500 h and&#160;Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells to retain 98.4% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 0.5C under &#8722;40 &#176;C.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are recognized for their high theoretical capacity, abundant availability, and low electrochemical potential. However, the slow Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and the poor solid electrolyte interface (SEI) of commercial electrolytes hinder their application at low temperatures. Herein, we propose a novel ultralow&#8208;temperature, non&#8208;flammable ester&#8208;based electrolyte system incorporating trimethyl phosphate (TEP), which exhibits a low melting point, low viscosity, and low polarity. The results of theoretical calculations indicate that the addition of TEP significantly alters the proportions of aggregates (AGGs) solvated structures and reduces the de&#8208;solvation energy barrier for sodium ions. Additionally, research on interface structure reveals that the increase in AGGs configurations promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer. Consequently, the TEP&#8208;based electrolyte enables stable cycling for over 1500 h in symmetric cells at &#8722;40 &#176;C, while achieving a capacity retention rate of 98.4% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C in Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells.

         <title>Mechanism of the Stoltz&#8211;Grubbs (KOtBu/Et3SiH) Silylation: Single&#8208;Electron Transfer is the Missing Link between the Heterolytic and Radical Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic and radical mechanisms explain many, but not all, of the observed features of Stoltz&#8211;Grubbs (KOtBu/Et3SiH) C&#8211;H silylation reactions. Herein we show how a new mechanism, featuring hydride transfer and single electron transfer (SET), reconciles the reaction's ionic and radical characteristics and accounts for its previously unexplained features.








Abstract
A new mechanism for the Stoltz&#8211;Grubbs (KOtBu/Et3SiH) silylation of heteroarenes is reported that successfully resolves the important unexplained experimental features of the reaction. The mechanism combines hydride transfer, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and single electron transfer (SET) steps (with the substrate hydride adduct being identified as a new SET donor) and is supported by extensive theoretical calculations. Previously proposed heterolytic and radical mechanisms do not involve SET. The discovery of a mechanistic role for SET explains why the silylation reaction simultaneously displays both heterolytic and radical character, and why it does not require free silyl radicals. Previously unexplained experimental results from reactions of isotopically labelled reactants and on the inhibitory effects of electron&#8208;accepting additives can also be understood based on the SET mechanism.

         <title>Closing Electron Transfer Loop to Boost Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed&#8208;loop electron transfer strategy employing fullerene (C60) achieves synergistic coupling of electrochemical and chemical processes through its reversible redox mediation, effectively suppressing over&#8208;reduction of Cu active sites. The generated fullerene anions (C60&#8319;&#8722;) spontaneously reduce nitrate to nitrite while regenerating C60, bypassing the thermodynamic rate&#8208;limiting step and optimizing the electrocatalytic reaction pathway of urea synthesis.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of carbon dioxide and nitrate presents a promising approach for environmentally friendly urea synthesis. In this work, we propose a strategy to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis by coupling the electrochemical and chemical steps. Utilizing fullerene (C60) as a redox&#8208;active electron mediator during the electrochemical reduction process, we effectively inhibit the irreversible reduction deactivation of positively charged copper (Cu&#948;+) active sites. The electron&#8208;accepting fullerene form ions (C60n&#8211;) that engage in a spontaneous chemical redox reaction with nitrate ions, producing nitrite ions and regenerating neutral C60 (C60n&#8211; + NO3&#8211; &#8594; C60&#160;+&#160;NO2&#8211;). This recycling mechanism closes the electron transfer loop while optimizing the overall reaction pathway. The urea yield rate is dramatically increased to 385.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, accompanied by long&#8208;term durability. Our findings provide a valuable framework for designing highly efficient electrocatalyst for coupling reactions, advancing the field of sustainable urea synthesis.

A silica&#8208;anchored cobaloxime catalyst enables efficient seawater electrolysis and energy storage. Coupled with photovoltaics and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries, this multifunctional system delivers continuous green H2 production, offering a scalable and sustainable pathway for renewable fuel generation. 








Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven seawater electrolysis presents a sustainable method for producing high&#8208;purity green hydrogen to address the energy crisis. Developing a robust electrocatalyst for seawater splitting is crucial for green fuel production with solar integration. This study introduces a silica&#8208;anchored cobaloxime system as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for overall seawater splitting in conjunction with photovoltaic cells. The system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen generation efficiency of 14%, a power conversion efficiency of 17.4%, and a round&#8208;trip energy efficiency of 80%. A single&#8208;stack electrolyser using this catalyst produces an average of 0.82&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 of green hydrogen and 0.44&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 of oxygen, with a hydrogen conversion efficiency of approximately 80&#160;kWh kg&#8722;1 under natural sunlight. The same catalyst also shows bidirectional O2 reduction and evolution activity, enabling solar energy storage through a rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (RZAB). A photovoltaic&#8208;RZAB&#8208;electrolyser triad was established for indirect green hydrogen production using stored renewable energy. The catalyst&#8208;containing RZAB system is effectively charged by a photovoltaic (PV)&#160;cell, achieving 25% energy efficiency, and facilitates seawater splitting without sunlight at an energy conversion efficiency of 84%. The strategic application of the catalyst as a multifunctional electrocatalyst enables sustainable green hydrogen production both during the day and night under practical conditions.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Porphin Framework Membrane for Almost Perfectly Selective Li+ Retention</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;porphin framework (MHOPF) membrane was fabricated, enabling selective Li&#8314; retention and the passage of all major competing cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+). Through experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the ion&#8208;selective transport mechanism was elucidated, revealing the porphin in the MHOPF could effectively recognize ions. This work suggests that separating Li+ by selective retainment may pave the way toward membrane&#8208;based direct lithium extraction technologies.








Abstract
Membrane separation of Li+ from other ions, particularly alkaline ions, offers a green way toward direct lithium extraction from various brines. Here we report a metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;porphin framework membrane, allowing the passage of all major competing cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) while only retaining Li+. The crystalline nature of the membrane allows periodically arranged porphin molecules, enabling stable molecular recognition effect. By density functional theory calculations, we found that the porphin molecules had a strong interaction with Li+ and prevented their translocation through the porphin cavity. As a result, the membrane allows Na+ and K+ transport but rejects the transport of Li+ completely. Notably, due to the much higher mobility of divalent ions, the membrane also allows the passage of Ca2+ and Mg2+ while still retaining Li+ under a low external voltage (0.8&#160;V). We expect that this work establishes metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;porphin framework membrane as a promising and versatile platform for ion sieving studies and applications.

         <title>Pd&#9472;N4 Sites in MOFs Modulate Oxygen Reduction Pathways for 100% Selective Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion from Oxygenated Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#9472;N4 site engineering in MOFs enable modulation of the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during photocatalytic CO2 reduction in oxygenated flue gas. Such CO&#8208;mediated oxygen scavenging mechanism not only mitigates the competition for electrons and protons by ORR but also purifies CO2 reduction products, thereby achieving selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion under aerobic conditions.








Abstract
Direct photocatalytic CO2 reduction in flue gas is significantly challenged by the thermodynamically favored oxygen reduction reaction. While conventional approaches showed promise, the inherent O2 affinity of transition and noble metals prevented full suppression of O2 adsorption and activation, severely constraining the multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfers required for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway. We therefore envisioned a CO&#8208;mediated oxygen scavenging mechanism by modulating oxygen reduction pathways. Via Pd&#9472;N4 site engineering, the resulting Pd/Cu3(HITP)2/TiO2 composite effectively suppressed competitive oxygen reduction reaction, enabling selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion under aerobic conditions. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations revealed that the Pd&#9472;N4 sites steered oxygen reduction toward CO&#8208;mediated pathways&#8212;thermodynamically and kinetically favored over conventional oxygen reduction reaction, thereby mitigating competitive effects and simultaneously purifying the product. Consequently, such composite exhibited complete CH4 selectivity at 6.7 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under simulated industrial flue gas conditions (15 vol% CO2, 3 vol% O2, 5 vol% H2O, balanced N2). Our work highlights catalytic site modulation and advances a new strategy for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in oxygenated flue gas via pathway&#8208;selective oxygen reduction.

         <title>Tungstotellurate(VI)&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Inhibits Breast Cancer Proliferation and Metastasis by Enhancing Cuproptosis and Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sandwich&#8208;type tungstotellurate(VI) Na[(CH3)2NH2]13H[Sc3(H2O)2Te2W24O90]&#183;92H2O (Sc3Te2W24) was synthesized via a simple bottom&#8208;up approach. The Sc3Te2W24 cluster was subsequently encapsulated in responsive Cu&#8208;SS nanocarriers tailored for the tumor microenvironment. The POM/Cu&#8208;SS@HA nanocomposite efficiently halts breast cancer proliferation and metastasis through enhanced cuproptosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
Cuproptosis, characterized by the accumulation of copper (Cu) ions and mitochondrial respiration modulation, holds great potential in cancer therapy. As a newly defined mode of cell death regulation, the mechanisms of copper efflux and high intracellular levels of reducing substances may impair cuproptosis efficacy. To address this, a nanocomposite designated POM/Cu&#8208;SS@HA was constructed, comprising sandwich&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) Na[(CH3)2NH2]13H[Sc3(H2O)2Te2W24O90]&#183;92H2O (Sc3Te2W24), disulfide&#8208;bridged copper&#8208;based complexes (Cu&#8208;SS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) for targeted delivery. This system induces cuproptosis through copper accumulation, leading to lipoylated protein aggregation and iron&#8211;sulfur cluster protein depletion, while concurrently facilitating photothermal therapy (PTT) and apoptosis. The POM (Sc3Te2W24) cluster exhibited potent antitumor effects via p53&#8208;dependent apoptotic pathway reactivation. In vitro studies demonstrated over 85.6% inhibition rate against 4T1 breast cancer cells when combining POM/Cu&#8208;SS@HA with 808&#160;nm NIR irradiation. In vivo results showed 92.8% tumor growth suppression compared to the controls. Transcriptome analysis further identified altered expression profiles in glutathione (GSH) metabolism and mitochondrial function&#8208;related genes, confirming the dual induction of cuproptosis and apoptosis. These findings establish a synergistic nanotherapeutic strategy with enhanced efficacy for breast cancer treatment.

         <title>Development of High Performance Pyrolized Polyimide&#8208;based Carbon Molecular Sieves for Enhanced Selectivity of Propylene/Propane Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report extremely selective carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) pyrolized from a triptycence&#8208;based intrinsically microporous polyimide: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride&#8208;2,6(7)&#8208;diamino triptycene (6FDA&#8208;DAT1). A fresh CMS membrane pyrolyzed at 800 &#176;C for 2&#160;h displayed a mixed&#8208;gas C3H6 permeability of 56 Barrer combined with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 66. A remarkable increase in mixed&#8208;gas C3H6/C3H8 selectivity up to 152 was observed after 147 days of continuous mixed&#8208;gas testing at 4&#160;bar.








Abstract
The replacement or de&#8208;bottlenecking of the highly energy&#8208;intensive distillation unit operation process for propylene/propane separation has long posed a formidable challenge. Although membrane technology can potentially offer a more energy&#8208;efficient alternative, existing materials lack the requisite mixed&#8208;gas selectivity for industrial use. Achieving effective separation for propylene and propane with only 0.13&#197; difference in molecular size requires membranes with superb molecular sieving properties. Here, we report extremely selective carbon molecular sieve (CMS) materials fabricated by utilizing a triptycene&#8208;based intrinsically microporous 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride&#8208;2,6(7)&#8208;diamino triptycene (6FDA&#8208;DAT1) polyimide precursor and adjusting its microstructure through finely tuned high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. A freshly prepared isotropic CMS membrane pyrolyzed at 800 &#176;C for 2&#160;h displayed a mixed&#8208;gas propylene permeability of 56 Barrer combined with a C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 66. Notably, after an extended period of continuous mixed&#8208;gas testing and aging at 4&#160;bar over 147 days, the CMS membrane exhibited a remarkable increase in mixed&#8208;gas propylene/propane selectivity to 152&#8212;an unmatched value to date for a CMS material&#8212;because of selective tightening of the CMS microstructure by physical aging.

         <title>Tailoring Na&#8314; Chelation Dynamics for Expedient Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,1&#8208;diethoxyethane (CDEE) molecule, characterized by its weak chelation effect, diminishes its interaction with Na&#8314; ions and promotes the formation of an aggregation&#8208;dominated solvation sheath. This solvation environment demonstrates remarkable compatibility with both sodium&#8208;metal anode and sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode, ultimately enabling Na&#8211;S batteries to achieve superior cycling performance under low&#8208;temperature conditions.








Abstract
Sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical energy density and the abundant natural availability of sodium and sulfur. However, sluggish kinetics of sulfur conversion, slow Na&#8314; transport, and interfacial instability at low temperatures pose significant challenges for their operation and limit their practical application. Herein, three solvents with well&#8208;designed molecular configurations are examined. We systematically investigate the impact of chelation effect on the desolvation behavior, sulfur conversion process, ion dynamics, and Na&#8314; plating/stripping behavior. Compared with conventional linear ether solvents, the incorporation of methyl groups not only weaken the chelation capability and tailors the inner solvation sheath, but also reduces the energy barrier for Na&#8314; transport, thus promoting enhanced sulfur conversion kinetics under low temperature conditions. This work elucidates the relationship among solvent molecules, Na&#8314; desolvation behavior, and sulfur reaction kinetics, and offers a strategy for rational design of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Organic Microemulsion Electrolytes for Advanced Metal Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced organic microemulsion electrolytes (OMEs) have been engineered through phase&#8208;optimized emulsification of high&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio electrolytes with nonpolar solvents and amphiphilic surfactants. The pouch cells with as&#8208;prepared LiFSI&#8208;TMP/TFEP/PFPN OME demonstrate intrinsic safety and robust cycling stability, while exhibiting excellent low&#8208;temperature performance and passing rigorous nail penetration. The proposed OME design paradigm demonstrates broad applicability across various secondary battery systems, significantly expanding the selection range of compatible diluents and providing critical insights for engineering next&#8208;generation advanced electrolytes.








Abstract
Current carbonate electrolytes encounter a bottleneck for high&#8208;performance lithium rechargeable batteries due to their potential safety issues, narrow operating temperature range, limited electrochemical windows, and chemical instability. Herein, advanced organic microemulsion electrolytes (OMEs) are developed by emulsifying the high&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio electrolytes to decrease the viscosity and molarity with nonpolar solvents and surfactants. The as&#8208;prepared nonflammable LiFSI&#8208;TMP/TFEP/PFPN OME shows intrinsic safety and high stability toward the graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode. The pouch cells with this OME demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability of 200 cycles, along with excellent low&#8208;temperature performance, and meanwhile pass the nail penetration safety test. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;OME&#8221; can be extended to prepare other electrolyte systems with compatible electrochemical properties for different battery systems at extreme conditions, which opens a new avenue in electrolyte development by extending the choice of solvents for broadening the application fields of advanced rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Recoverable Fluorination Accelerates Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerisation and Enables Post&#8208;Polymerisation&#8208;Modification of Polyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated polyester is introduced via ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation of pentafluorostyrene oxide and phthalic anhydride. Pendant C6F5 groups accelerate catalysis through fluorine&#8208;specific interactions, enabling access to high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight materials. These groups serve as reactive handles for efficient post&#8208;polymerisation and surface modification, allowing property tuning while preserving degradability and enabling fluoride recovery.








Abstract
Fluorination of polymers is a powerful strategy to enhance chemical or material properties yet integrating these benefits into degradable polymers remains underexplored. Here, we report a new class of fluorinated polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation of pentafluoro styrene oxide with phthalic anhydride. The pendant C6F5 groups accelerate catalysis through fluorine&#8208;specific &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and improve obtained molecular weights compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated variant giving access to high weight materials (Mn,max. &gt; 100&#160;kg&#160;mol&#8722;1) with thermal and mechanical properties competitive with commodity plastics. These C6F5 groups then act as reactive handles in the material for efficient post&#8208;polymerisation modification (PPM) in solution, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of thermal, mechanical, optical, and solubility properties. PPM can even be performed on material surfaces, films and fibres can be selectively modified without dissolution. Lastly, degradation enables quantitative recovery of fluorine centres as sodium fluoride, offering a sustainable end&#8208;of&#8208;life option for the incorporated fluorine. Our work demonstrates how targeted fluorination of degradable polyesters can simultaneously enhance catalysis and unlock advanced material functionality.

         <title>Stereodivergent Alkylation of Unstrained C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two protocols for stereodivergent allylic C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond alkylation are established for the construction of unnatural amino acids bearing two continuous stereocenters and carbonyl compounds containing a fully substituted fluorinated stereocenter. Synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis enables access to all four stereoisomers of corresponding motifs.








Abstract
Asymmetric functionalization of C&#9472;C &#963; bond is a straightforward way to edit molecule backbones but heavily relies on strained rings. The related process with unstrained structure is highly challenging, and only several cases are reported. However, these examples can just achieve related enantiomers through C&#9472;C &#963; bond activation. The stereodivergent C&#9472;C &#963; bond functionalization for precise access to all stereoisomers is unknown. Here we have established two catalytic systems to show the feasibility of unstrained C&#9472;C &#963; bond functionalization as an efficient pathway in stereodivergent synthesis. Both unnatural amino acid derivatives bearing two vicinal stereocenters and carbonyl compounds containing a tertiary fluoride are constructed in good yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Stereodivergent access to all these chiral skeletons is demonstrated possible with simple dictation of ligand configurations. Mechanistic studies unveil the resolution pathway of racemic allyl substrates through diene formation instead of typical metal interconversion and C&#9472;C formation as rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Reversible Sandwich&#8208;Based Particle Nanoswitch for Continuous Protein Monitoring at Picomolar Concentrations with Automated Calibration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible particle nanoswitch sensor enables continuous protein monitoring by forming transient sandwich complexes in the presence of analyte molecules. Site&#8208;specific conjugations ensure optimal antibody fragment orientation. Demonstrated for lactoferrin, the sensor achieves picomolar sensitivity with &#8764;12&#160;min time delay and continuous measurements over more than 12&#160;h. Automated calibration keeps deviations below 10%, suitable for long&#8208;term bioprocess monitoring.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of specific proteins is essential for understanding the dynamics of biological systems and for enabling real&#8208;time measurement&#8208;and&#8208;control strategies in bioprocesses. Ideally, sensors for continuous monitoring should be intrinsically reversible and able to perform accurate measurements over long time spans. Here, we present a particle nanoswitch sensor containing two different antibody fragments that bind reversibly to a protein of interest and thus form transient sandwich complexes. The antibody fragments are incorporated into the sensor using site&#8208;specific conjugation strategies to achieve optimal antibody orientation. Short&#8208;lived sandwich complexes are detected with single&#8208;molecule resolution, by tracking the motion of tethered particles. The sensing concept is demonstrated for lactoferrin, an iron&#8208;binding and immune&#8208;modulating protein. We show continuous measurements of picomolar concentrations, with a delay time of less than 12&#160;min, over a monitoring period of more than 12&#160;h. Automated calibration strategies are described that result in a mean absolute relative difference below 10% compared to reference measurements. These results demonstrate how rapid continuous protein sensing at picomolar concentrations can be achieved using reversible sandwich&#8208;based particle nanoswitches, enabling long&#8208;term monitoring of dynamic bioprocesses.

Automated calibration strategies are described that result in a mean absolute relative difference below 10% compared to reference measurements. These results demonstrate how rapid continuous protein sensing at picomolar concentrations can be achieved using reversible sandwich-based particle nanoswitches, enabling long-term monitoring of dynamic bioprocesses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

TmT1&#946;H, a novel taxane C1&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase belonging to the &#945;&#8208;KG/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Taxus&#160;&#215;&#160;media cell cultures that catalyzes 1&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1) to form a major product baccatin IV (1a) and its isomer (1b). Tm576, a novel dedicated &#945;&#8208;KG/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase that was able to convert 1 to 1b specifically. A mechanism that the 5/7/6&#8208;membered carbon framework arises from prototypical 6/8/6&#8208;type taxane skeleton via radical rearrangement was proposed.








Abstract
Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of one novel taxane C1&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (TmT1&#946;H), belonging to the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family from Taxus&#160;&#215;&#160;media cell cultures. The incubation of recombinant TmT1&#946;H with 1&#946;&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1) as a substrate led to the production of a major C1&#8208;hydroxylated product, baccatin IV (1a), and a minor product, 15&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;11(15&#8594;1)abeo&#8208;baccatin IV (1b), a non&#8208;classical 5/7/6&#8208;type taxane. Moreover, in vitro biochemical assays, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation combined with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed the critical amino acid residues for TmT1&#946;H catalysis. Substrate specificity investigations revealed that TmT1&#946;H preferred taxoids with high oxygenation level. Notably, we have also discovered a novel specific enzyme (Tm576) belonging to &#945;&#8208;KG/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase that was able to convert 1 to 1b independently. A mechanism that the 5/7/6&#8208;membered carbon framework arises from prototypical 6/8/6&#8208;type taxane skeleton via radical rearrangement was proposed based on DFT calculations. More importantly, we artificially reconstructed the biosynthetic pathway of two important taxanes, baccatin IV, and baccatin VI, from GGPP in tobacco system. This work not only fully characterizes the role of C1&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase of taxoids, but also offered new insights into the formation of taxane structural diversity.

         <title>A Novel Antimalarial Agent that Inhibits Protein Synthesis in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compound 31 represents a promising avenue for the development as an antimalarial agent with a potent activity profile (PfNF54 IC50&#160;&#177;&#160;s.d.&#160;=&#160;3.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;nM). It has a novel mode of action by binding to cytosolic ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in the parasite. 








Abstract
The emergence of drug resistance to nearly all antimalarials following their rollout underscores the need for novel chemotypes with novel modes of action to replenish the antimalarial drug&#8208;development pipeline. We identified a novel class of compounds in the antimalarial armory. Compound 31, characterized by a 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide scaffold, displays potent activity against blood&#8208;stage and mature sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum and no toxicity in human cells. Resistance selection studies with 31 identified a previously unknown point mutation in the P. falciparum multidrug&#8208;resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1) gene, for which we confirmed causality by CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;based gene editing as the primary mediator of resistance. No cross&#8208;resistance toward first&#8208;line antimalarials was identified in compound 31&#8208;resistant parasites. Proteomics studies indicated that the primary mode of action of 31 is through direct binding to cytosolic ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in the parasite. Taken together, compound 31 is a promising starting point for the development of a next&#8208;generation antimalarial.

         <title>A Picolyl&#8208;Based Cys Caging/Uncaging Strategy Facilitates Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine (Cys), with a reactive thiol group, is key for site&#8208;specific bioconjugation and chemical protein synthesis like native chemical ligation (NCL). We developed a picolyl&#8208;based photolabile protecting group (PPG) for Cys, enabling pH/wavelength&#8208;controlled caging/uncaging and photoorthogonal activation in the presence of a nitrobenzyl group. Its use in synthesizing glycoproteins such as tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) advances complex protein synthesis.








Abstract
Endowed with a reactive thiol group, cysteine (Cys) provides a versatile handle for site&#8208;specific bioconjugation and serves as a cornerstone of chemical protein synthesis, particularly in native chemical ligation (NCL). Extensions such as expressed protein ligation (EPL)&#8208;desulfurization have significantly broadened access to challenging proteins. However, they require orthogonal caging/uncaging protecting groups to enable selective desulfurization in the presence of native cysteines, a process that is crucial for synthetic applications. Photolabile protecting groups (PPGs), which are cleaved via irradiation, offer a simpler and less disruptive approach to protein assembly compared to traditional thiol protecting groups. However, current commercially available PPGs are not compatible with orthogonal protection and EPL&#8208;desulfurization. To address this challenge, we developed a novel and simple picolyl&#8208;based PPG for Cys caging/uncaging, which enables rapid orthogonal caging of thiols and their subsequent uncaging via pH and wavelength control. Notably, the picolyl group undergoes photoorthogonal activation in the presence of a nitrobenzyl group. The efficient synthesis of interleukin&#8208;4 (IL&#8208;4) via one&#8208;pot iterative ligation and tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) via EPL&#8208;desulfurization further highlights how this strategy significantly advances the synthesis of complex proteins.

         <title>Superatomic or Not? A Case Study on Isostructural Au3Ag2 and Au3Cu2 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural nanoclusters, [Au3Ag2(Ppy3)6](NO3)3 (Au3Ag2) and [Au3Cu2(Ppy3)6](BF4)3 (Au3Cu2), are synthesized, and they demonstrate different stability. Calculations show that Au3Ag2 is the smallest well&#8208;defined superatom, while Au3Cu2 with identical electron count is nonsuperatomic. This contrast underscores how doping governs electronic structures and stability, offering new insights into the superatom model.








Abstract
Two bimetal nanoclusters, [Au3Ag2(Ppy3)6](NO3)3 (Au3Ag2) and [Au3Cu2(Ppy3)6](BF4)3 (Au3Cu2) have been synthesized with tri(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (Ppy3). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that both have trigonal bipyramidal structures with three Au atoms at the waist and Ag/Cu atoms at the top and bottom vertices. Au3Ag2 demonstrates much better stability than Au3Cu2 in solution. Theoretical calculations indicate that Au3Ag2 is the smallest well&#8208;defined superatom while Au3Cu2 is nonsuperatomic, even though they are isostructural and have the same number of valence electrons. This work highlights the influence of atom doping on the electronic structures and superatomic properties of metal nanoclusters.

&lt;p&gt;Two bimetal nanoclusters, [Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ppy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;](NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and [Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ppy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) have been synthesized with tri(2-pyridyl)phosphine (&lt;b&gt;Ppy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). Single crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that both have trigonal bipyramidal structures with three Au atoms at the waist and Ag/Cu atoms at the top and bottom vertices. &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates much better stability than &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; in solution. Theoretical calculations indicate that &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is the smallest well-defined superatom while &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is nonsuperatomic, even though they are isostructural and have the same number of valence electrons. This work highlights the influence of atom doping on the electronic structures and superatomic properties of metal nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Oxygen Electroreduction Efficiency of Porous Silicon&#8208;based Catalysts via Atomic Iron Site&#8208;Induced Lattice Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and stability of Fe incorporation into porous Si catalysts for the acidic ORR.



Abstract
Developing non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts as alternatives to precious metals for the 4 electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions is crucial in advancing practical proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) technology. A significant challenge in designing these electrocatalysts is to suppress metal leaching and optimize the adsorption and dissociation free energy of oxygen intermediates during the reaction. Herein, a carbon&#8208;encapsulated porous silicon (Si) featuring single iron (Fe) sites was developed as an effective ORR catalyst through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction process using silica nanoparticles as precursors. This catalyst exhibited both impressive activity with half&#8208;wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.88&#160;V and 0.95&#160;V, alongside robust stability showing minimal decay of 7 and 4&#160;mV after 40,000 potential cycles under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Additionally, as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs, it reached a peak power density of 0.63&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#160;bar H2&#8211;O2 condition, while maintaining notable durability at a constant potential of 0.5&#160;V over a duration of 100 h. Spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that iron atoms were effectively integrated into the crystal lattice of porous Si, resulting in the formation of stable Si&#9472;Fe bonds that inhibited the leaching of Fe and the formation of *OOH intermediates, thereby enhancing the ORR performance. This approach facilitates the design of efficient and stable ORR catalysts, which hold significant implications for the advancement of next&#8208;generation PEMFCs.

         <title>In Situ Visualization of Lattice&#8208;Coherent Phase Oscillations and Active Brownian Motion of a Copper Catalyst During Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;coherent Cu&#8596;Cu2O phase oscillations during hydrogen oxidation have been directly observed through operando transmission electron microscopy. These oscillations transform Cu nanoparticles into self&#8208;propelled active matter that dynamically balances sintering and self&#8208;regeneration via particle splitting, offering a new strategy for stable catalyst design.








Abstract
Structural dynamics govern the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles (NPs), yet their atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms remain unclear. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we reveal redox&#8208;driven lattice&#8208;coherent Cu&#8596;Cu2O phase oscillations in individual Cu NPs during hydrogen oxidation conditions. These oscillations generate active Brownian particles, wherein asymmetric H2 oxidation leads to directional motion that results in particle collisions and sintering. Crucially, the same active Brownian motion also triggers particle splitting, counteracting surface area loss and deactivation. Such active matter behavior arises from the formation of a head&#8211;tail morphology at critical H2:O2 ratios (e.g., 5:1), featuring a metallic&#8208;rich head and an oxide&#8208;dominated tail, with their volumetric balance dynamically shifting through competitive oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles. Quantitative analysis establishes a direct correlation between migration velocity and redox dynamics, revealing that the oxidation process significantly enhances particle mobility while the followed reduction process slows the velocity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that particle elongation and oxide tail fragmentation, accompanying particle migration, can be explained by asymmetric adhesion forces between the metallic/oxide phases and the silicon nitride support, alongside the redox reactions occurring on the particles. This work provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into catalyst dynamics under operando redox conditions, offering foundational knowledge for designing stable, high&#8208;performance catalytic systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the recent advances in photochemical di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (DPM) rearrangement and its heteroatom variants (ODPM, ADPM), showcasing their evolution from UV&#8208;driven curiosities to versatile visible&#8208;light photocatalyzed reactions for synthesizing complex strained architectures through energy transfer mechanisms, enabling efficient synthesis of complex natural products and functional materials.








Abstract
Photochemical di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (DPM) rearrangement, a classic transformation pioneered by Zimmerman, elegantly converts 1,4&#8208;dienes and related systems into complex, strain&#8208;rich vinylcyclopropane architectures. For decades, its utility in organic synthesis was constrained by its reliance on direct UV irradiation, which limited functional group tolerance and practical application. However, the recent integration of this elegant photochemical rearrangement with the principles of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet energy transfer catalysis has sparked a dramatic renaissance. This review chronicles the journey of the DPM rearrangement from its foundational mechanistic principles to its modern catalytic incarnation. We detail the expansion of the reaction family&#8212;encompassing oxa&#8208; (ODPM) and aza&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ADPM) variants&#8212;and highlight its evolving applications in the total synthesis of natural products and beyond. Finally, we offer a perspective on future opportunities, underscoring how this venerable reaction continues to enable synthetic innovation and discovery in the 21st century.

         <title>Quantitative Reactivity Profiling of Functional Arginine Residues in Human Cancer Cell Line Proteomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent probe targeting arginine was used along with the proteomic platform isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis&#8208;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP) to identify hyperreactive arginine residues in the human proteome of cancer cell lines. This approach underscores the essential role of arginine in protein function, highlighting its biological importance and therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Arginine, a critical amino acid for protein structure and function, is involved in enzyme catalysis and macromolecular interactions. However, selectively targeting its reactive guanidine group has been challenging. Here, we utilized a probe, AP&#8208;1, based on phenylglyoxal, which demonstrated remarkable chemical selectivity and reactivity toward arginine residues. Using activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP), we explored the human proteome across four cancer cell lines, obtaining quantitative data for approximately 17&#160;000 arginine residues. This analysis led to the identification of several previously unreported hyperreactive arginine residues, including R43 of PKM, R171 of LDHA, R172 of LDHB, R341 of CKB, R168 of EIF4A1, and R118 of FUBP1, which are crucial for protein function. Notably, the mutation of CKB's R341 inhibited cell proliferation and migration by downregulating energy supply. We also introduced ArGO&#8208;LDHA&#8208;1, a covalent inhibitor targeting LDHA's hyperreactive arginine residues, showing potential to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. This work highlights the biological significance of arginine residues and provides a platform for large&#8208;scale profiling of arginine reactivity.

This work adopts spinel as a model via substituting cobalt in Co3O4 with Fe/Cu ions to induce varying degrees of structural asymmetry and decipher the relationship between local structural asymmetry and electronic structure reconfiguration. The highly asymmetric structure of Cu&#8208;Co3O4 significantly triggers charge redistribution and d&#8208;orbital spin splitting, which effectively enhances catalytic activity and stablity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries provide an extremely feasible strategy for sustainable development and carbon neutrality. However, due to the sluggish kinetics and complex interfacial reactions, Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are limited by low output voltage and poor cycling stability. Developing efficient and durable catalysts remains an urgent challenge. Transition metal oxides have gained significant attention owing to their availability and stability for electrocatalytic reactions, but their catalytic activity remains unsatisfactory toward Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, this work proposes an asymmetric Fe/Cu&#8208;incorporated Co3O4 tactic system to tune charge distribution for motivating efficient electrocatalysis and decipher the mechanism of asymmetric structure modulation on the promotion of catalytic activity and stability. It is unraveled that d&#8208;orbital spin splitting induces the modification of nondegenerate state, which enhances catalyst durability, while simultaneously increasing electron occupancy in dxz/yz orbitals. This higher electron occupancy facilitates the hybridization with the p orbitals of reactants and intermediates via &#960; bonding, thereby strengthening the adsorption activity. In consequence, the Li&#8208;CO2 battery with Cu&#8208;Co3O4 cathode demonstrates a low overpotential of 0.73&#160;V and high Coulombic efficiency of 96%, outperforming batteries with Co3O4 and Fe&#8208;Co3O4. This work offers a unique insight for electronic structure regulation strategy and displays a high&#8208;performance catalyst for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>A High Modulus, Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive, Interwoven Protein Network With Topologically Confined Micro&#8208;Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first entirely protein&#8208;based hydrogel with interwoven network topology constructed from supramolecular polymerization of pseudo[2]catenane precursors that can be triggered by multiple stimuli. The hydrogel achieves a unique combination of high stiffness, self&#8208;healing properties, and multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness through the synergy of topological entanglement and confined micro&#8208;associations, providing a versatile and programmable platform for biomedical and catalytic applications.








Abstract
All&#8208;protein&#8208;based materials are attractive for their genetic encodability, precise structure, and versatile functions, yet integrating mechanical strength, dynamic adaptability, and functional activity in one system remains challenging. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;healing, all&#8208;protein&#8208;based network with an interwoven network topology, whose mechanics can be further reinforced by topologically confined micro&#8208;association upon tempering. The network was constructed by polymerizing pseudo[2]catenanes&#8212;which employ p53dim for entanglement and SpyTag(DA)&#8208;SpyCatcher complex for physical cyclization&#8212;that are opened into a star&#8208;like conformation. Network formation can be triggered by increasing concentration, calmodulin (CaM) binding, or light irradiation (when azoswitch&#8208;modified CaM is used). Subsequent tempering unfolds the SpyTag/SpyCatcher complex, inducing micro&#8208;association that acts as additional crosslinks within the topologically confined network. While the entangled architecture minimizes chain slippage, the micro&#8208;associations enhance crosslinking and stress dissipation, collectively improving mechanical properties and long&#8208;term stability. We further demonstrate its practical utility in controlled release and enzyme immobilization, establishing topological proteins as a versatile platform for designing genetically programmable, mechanically tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials.

         <title>Molecular Design&#8208;Enabled Pyridinium&#8208;Based Metal Halide Glass Scintillators with Robust Glass&#8208;Forming Ability and Tailorable Radioluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel hybrid manganese bromide glasses was developed by structurally engineering pyridinium&#8208;based cations. The optimized (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy)2MnBr4 (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpyridinium) combines efficient luminescence with exceptional glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA), serving as a high&#8208;resolution scintillator (18&#160;lp mm&#8722;1) for X&#8208;ray imaging. Its robust GFA also enables the fabrication of two&#8208;component glasses for visual radiation detection. 








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide (OIMH) glasses represent a promising class of functional materials due to their facile synthesis, high transparency, and composition tunability. However, a significant gap persists in the diversity of applicable glassy material systems and the availability of well&#8208;defined structural design guidelines compared to their crystalline counterparts. Herein, we synthesized a series of pyridine&#8208;based OIMH crystals exhibiting efficient luminescence and exceptional melting properties. Through systematic benzyl functionalization and phenyl substitution on the pyridinium cation, we have optimized both luminescence efficiency and glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA). Among them, (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy)2MnBr4 (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpyridinium) displays the lowest melting temperature (Tm&#160;=&#160;111.9&#160;&#176;C) and the highest glass transition temperature (Tg&#160;=&#160;50.3&#160;&#176;C), yielding excellent GFA as indicated by a high Tg/Tm ratio of 0.84. The exceptional GFA is further demonstrated by the glass's remarkable stability, retaining an amorphous state even after annealing at 80&#160;&#176;C for 8 weeks. It also allows for co&#8208;melting with other easily crystallizable components, which facilitates the preparation of two&#8208;component glasses with precisely tunable radioluminescence properties. These advanced glassy materials provide opportunities for practical X&#8208;ray imaging and real&#8208;time visualization of multicolor radiation detection, further establishing new design paradigms for OIMH scintillators.

         <title>Beyond van der Waals: Modular Identification of 2D Materials in Strongly Bonded Layered Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular decoding strategy unveils thousands of hidden 2D materials in strongly bonded non&#8208;van der Waals crystals, overcoming limitations of conventional algorithms. Guided by thermodynamic screening, the method enables the first proton&#8208;exchange exfoliation of HxRuO3 nanosheets from Na2RuO3, confirming the reliability of the modularity strategy.








Abstract
Top&#8208;down exfoliation of layered solids has revolutionized materials innovation by enabling unprecedented access to atomically thin architectures. To expand the frontier of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, it is imperative to systematically identify non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) layered systems with strong interlayer bonding. While conventional atomic distance&#8208;based algorithms effectively identify vdW materials, they are considerably limited when applied to chemically bonded non&#8208;vdW systems due to their inherent bonding complexity. Here, we introduce a structural modularity paradigm that resolves dimensional identification challenges by removing specific elements from strongly bonded crystals to construct artificial substructures from residual atoms. Coupled with the appropriate layer&#8208;recognition algorithms for vdW lattices, this approach reveals 8,889 hidden 2D modules across 30,147 ternary compounds, of which 80.6% are undetectable by traditional layer&#8208;detection approaches. These findings show that non&#8208;vdW layered solids significantly outnumber vdW counterparts (1,383), highlighting a vast chemical space for 2D materials exploration. High&#8208;throughput thermodynamic screening of 15,312 ternary oxides identifies 1,083 chemically stable 2D modules exfoliable via a proton exchange&#8208;assisted method. Validation against 15 experimentally reported 2D oxide nanosheets, along with the first synthesis of ultrathin HxRuO3 nanosheets from non&#8208;vdW Na2RuO3 crystal, confirms the reliability and predictive strength of this method for both known and previously unexplored systems.

&lt;p&gt;A modular decoding strategy unveils thousands of hidden 2D materials in strongly bonded non-van der Waals crystals, overcoming limitations of conventional algorithms. Guided by thermodynamic screening, the method enables the first proton-exchange exfoliation of H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets from Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, confirming the reliability of the modularity strategy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-down exfoliation of layered solids has revolutionized materials innovation by enabling unprecedented access to atomically thin architectures. To expand the frontier of two-dimensional (2D) materials, it is imperative to systematically identify non-van der Waals (non-vdW) layered systems with strong interlayer bonding. While conventional atomic distance-based algorithms effectively identify vdW materials, they are considerably limited when applied to chemically bonded non-vdW systems due to their inherent bonding complexity. Here, we introduce a structural modularity paradigm that resolves dimensional identification challenges by removing specific elements from strongly bonded crystals to construct artificial substructures from residual atoms. Coupled with the appropriate layer-recognition algorithms for vdW lattices, this approach reveals 8,889 hidden 2D modules across 30,147 ternary compounds, of which 80.6% are undetectable by traditional layer-detection approaches. These findings show that non-vdW layered solids significantly outnumber vdW counterparts (1,383), highlighting a vast chemical space for 2D materials exploration. High-throughput thermodynamic screening of 15,312 ternary oxides identifies 1,083 chemically stable 2D modules exfoliable via a proton exchange-assisted method. Validation against 15 experimentally reported 2D oxide nanosheets, along with the first synthesis of ultrathin H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets from non-vdW Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal, confirms the reliability and predictive strength of this method for both known and previously unexplored systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemically Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops mechanochemically induced circularly polarized luminescence (MICPL) in polymers by integrating achiral mechanophores into chiral polymer networks, where mechanical compression triggers fluorophore release and aggregation with chirality transfer, enabling tunable CPL colors, including white light and potential as stress&#8208;reporting probes.








Abstract
Achieving diversified optical signals in polymer mechanochemistry remains a significant challenge, particularly within the area of light polarization. This work pioneers the development of mechanochemically induced circularly polarized luminescence (MICPL) in polymers. We have designed crosslinked polymer networks by photopolymerizing achiral mechanophores (Diels&#8211;Alder adducts of maleimide and anthracene derivatives) with the chiral monomer L(&#8208;)&#8208;bornyl acrylate (LBA). Mechanical compression triggers the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the mechanophores, releasing fluorophores. Crucially, the applied force simultaneously promotes the aggregation of these released fluorophores and transfers the nonreciprocal chirality inherent in the compressed chiral polymer matrix (PLBA) to these aggregates, resulting in bright, force&#8208;dependent CPL emission with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to 10&#8722;2. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated with a series of mechanophores with varying electronic structures and copolymer matrix, enabling tunable CPL colors spanning from blue&#8208;violet to green to yellow&#8211;orange, and a ternary system achieving white CPL. The MICPL property was retained in copolymer systems (e.g., copolymers with achiral monomer methyl acrylate), demonstrating its potential as a macromolecular chiral optical probe for multimodal stress reporting. These findings resolve questions about mechanical force&#8208;regulated chirality and offer a platform for on&#8208;demand CPL materials.

         <title>Precise Kinetic Separation of Hexane Isomers via Morphology Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Diffusion&#8208;Selective Pore Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;621 features a tailored diffusion&#8208;selective pore structure that enables intrinsic kinetic recognition of hexane isomers. Combined with synergistic crystal size engineering, it achieves precise and multi&#8208;objective separation of all C6 alkane isomers. 








Abstract
Hexane isomer separation is critical to advancing sustainable and high&#8208;value refining in the petrochemical industry. However, precise separation of multi&#8208;component hexane mixtures with similar molecular structures remains a bottleneck. Herein, we report a novel metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;3,3&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;SIFSIX, termed as ZU&#8208;621) featuring a tailored diffusion&#8208;selective pore structure, synergistically integrated with crystal size engineering, that enables precise and efficient separation of hexane isomers. Owing to the uniquely engineered dumbbell&#8208;shaped, misaligned electronegative pore environment, ZU&#8208;621 exhibits intrinsic kinetic discrimination among hexane isomers based on the alkyl spatial distribution. Complementary crystal morphology engineering further fine&#8208;tunes the adsorption&#8211;diffusion behavior, affording precise kinetic separation across linear, mono&#8208;branched, and di&#8208;branched isomer pairs. As a result, this kinetic&#8208;morphology synergistic approach achieved benchmark separation performance as evidenced by record gasoline productivity (research octane numbers, RON&#160;&gt;&#160;95, 49.8&#160;L&#160;kg&#8722;1) along with precise, multi&#8208;objective separation across five hexane isomers.

         <title>A Probe Design Strategy Based on Cholesterol&#8208;Induced Differential Cellular Uptake for Cancer Cells Specific Penetration and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comparative LogP analysis of various compounds, we confirmed the existence of molecules with LogP values within the range of 1.48&#8211;1.62 that are capable of distinguishing cancer cells. TO&#8208;Ac was successfully applied to in vivo early cancer imaging and guided the surgical resection of tumors. This study proposes an innovative &#8220;passive targeting&#8221; strategy that operates independently of targeting ligand modifications and offers a novel molecular design framework for the development of broad&#8208;spectrum tumor diagnostic tools.








Abstract
Cancer metastasis and postoperative recurrence continue to pose significant challenges in the treatment of advanced&#8208;stage cancer, highlighting the urgent necessity for early diagnosis and precise intraoperative identification of lesions. In this study, we synthesized a series of molecules derived from the traditional nucleic acid probe thiazole orange (TO), by incorporating alkyl chains of varying lengths and hydrophilic functional groups. Among them, the specific lipophilicity of TO&#8208;Ac (a derivative of TO) enables its penetration into cancer cells, where it binds to nucleic acids and generates intense fluorescence, while being effectively excluded by normal cell membranes. The differential cholesterol content in cell plasma membranes was confirmed to influence the selective uptake of molecules in cancer cells. Accordingly, we established a quantitative design criterion (LogP&#160;=&#160;1.48&#8211;1.62) that predicts cancer cell specificity based on oil&#8208;water partition coefficients. Finally, TO&#8208;Ac was successfully applied for detection of early&#8208;stage colon cancer, enabling complete tumor resection via fluorescence imaging while identifying lesions that would otherwise remain undetected. This passive targeting strategy fundamentally challenges the conventional paradigm of ligand&#8208;modified probes, offering a transformative approach for the development of universal tumor identification systems.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transition Nanoparticles Enable Fluorescence Self&#8208;Reporting for Close&#8208;Loop Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reporting photodynamic therapy platform is achieved through combining a twisted intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced emission (TICT&#8208;AIE) photosensitizer (OTPA&#8208;DCPP) and phase&#8208;change material (PCM). The initial solid and high&#8208;polar environment maximizes ROS generation of OTPA&#8208;DCPP via TICT and AIE effects. The heat buildup during laser irradiation triggers phase transition, restoring fluorescence while halting ROS generation. The emerged fluorescence acts as a real&#8208;time theranostic dosimeter, signaling to cease irradiation for close&#8208;loop photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces a fundamental limitation of the intrinsic energy utilization competition between fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, while conventional &#8220;open&#8208;loop&#8221; protocols with pre&#8208;determined irradiation parameters risk overtreatment damage. To circumvent both challenges, we herein report phase transition nanoparticles (PTNPs) that enable self&#8208;regulated, self&#8208;reported, close&#8208;loop PDT via switching photosensitizers&#8217; molecular conformation. PTNPs were fabricated by co&#8208;encapsulating a twisted intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced emission (TICT&#8208;AIE) photosensitizer (OTPA&#8208;DCPP) and the phase&#8208;change material n&#8208;docosane (C22, Tm &#8776; 44.4 &#176;C) into lipid&#8208;PEG nanoparticles. With TICT effect to reduce the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and AIE effect to suppress nonradiative dissipation, OTPA&#8208;DCPP exhibits polarity&#8208;enhanced type I ROS generation. C22 initially creates a rigid and polar microenvironment that stabilizes OTPA&#8208;DCPP's TICT and AIE effects, maximizing ROS generation. During PDT progress, PTNPs consumed oxygen and accumulated heat, the melted C22 above Tm created a nonpolar microenvironment, restoring the intense fluorescence while halting ROS generation. The emerged fluorescence serves as a real&#8208;time indicator of OTPA&#8208;DCPP's functional status, providing an unambiguous cue to cease irradiation to avoid energy waste and excessive heat buildup. As such, PTNPs circumvent excited&#8208;state energy reallocation challenges, which also serve as a self&#8208;reported, close&#8208;loop PDT system for safe and precise phototheranostics.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Coordinated Lipids: Facilitators for Enhanced mRNA Delivery Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of zinc&#8208;coordinated lipids (Zn&#8208;CL) into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) modifies the interaction forces between LNPs and mRNA, subsequently enhancing mRNA delivery through benefiting multiple processes, including cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and mRNA release. Zn&#8208;CL LNPs hold substantial promise to augment the therapeutic efficiency of mRNA and advance their clinical application.








Abstract
The advancement of mRNA therapeutics necessitates more efficient delivery systems. Current clinically advanced lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) primarily bind mRNA through electrostatic interactions, with limited exploration of other intermolecular forces that can benefit multiple delivery processes. Here, we design zinc&#8208;coordinated lipids (Zn&#8208;CL) to formulate LNPs, enabling high mRNA delivery efficacy in vivo. The zinc&#8208;coordinated moieties in ionizable lipids show strong affinity toward phosphate groups, yielding tight yet reversible mRNA encapsulation. In addition, due to the abundance of phosphate groups in biological membranes, Zn&#8208;CL lipids engage them to boost enhanced cellular uptake. Once inside endosomes, competitive binding of zinc&#8208;coordinated moieties to the membranes strengthens endosomal destabilization and weakens Zn&#8209;CL/mRNA interactions, enabling efficient endosomal escape as well as rapid cytosolic mRNA release and resolving the long&#8209;standing paradox between stable encapsulation and efficient release. As a result, zinc coordination introduction simultaneously solves multiple mRNA delivery obstacles, ultimately leading to 29&#8208;fold higher mRNA translation than FDA&#8208;approved SM&#8208;102 LNPs in vivo. Notably, this coordination strategy is extendable to other metal ions, with cobalt&#8208;coordinated lipids facilitating spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. These findings highlight the substantial potential of metal&#8208;coordinated lipids as a versatile platform for enhancing mRNA therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Catalytic Asymmetric Lower&#8208;Rim Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes (ICCs) were synthesized via asymmetric lower&#8208;rim functionalization. In this approach, chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) organocatalysis, with vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) serving as pivotal intermediates, enables stepwise asymmetric halo&#8208;cyclization. A diverse library of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes featuring multiple C&#9472;C axial stereogenic axes with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities is obtained.








Abstract
We report herein an efficient approach for the enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes (ICCs) via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed lower&#8208;rim asymmetric functionalization. With vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) as the key intermediates, a stepwise asymmetric halo&#8208;cyclization strategy was applied to construct diverse inherently chiral calix[4]arenes bearing multiple C&#9472;C axially stereogenic elements with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 96% ee, all d.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1). The obtained lower&#8208;rim functionalized products underwent further photocatalytic transformations to access novel inherently chiral naphthofuran&#8208;based calix[4]arene architectures. Further synthetic modifications and analysis of their photophysical/chiroptical properties demonstrated their potential in optoelectronic materials and related fields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds via a stepwise process, with the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step occurring in the first VQMs&#8208;mediated cyclization, and the second step constituting a chiral transfer process.

Perched in equilibrium upon the T4&#8208;CdCu cluster, a balancing bird symbolizes the optimal balance between kinetics and thermodynamics achieved by the semiconductor cluster catalyst under visible&#8208;light excitation. In their Research Article (e202509764), Tao Wu et&#160;al. demonstrate that this equilibrium enables highly efficient and selective activation of inert substrates&#8212;such as non&#8208;activated arenes and aryl halides&#8212;delivering unprecedented photocatalytic performance under mild reaction conditions.

The cover shows an artistic interpretation of how bimetallic nanowire arrays are fabricated using block copolymer film templates. The tornado represents the mixing of metal precursors that impregnate the poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) domains. The nanowires are illustrated as periodically arranged flowerbeds, with octahedral Co(CN)63&#8722; as blue, six&#8208;petal flowers, and square&#8208;planar PdCl42&#8722; as four&#8208;petal, red flowers. Details are described in the Research Article (e202512695) by Roy Shenhar et&#160;al.

In their Research Article (e202513719), William J. Brittain et al. present the reaction cycle of a tetrafluoroazobenzene (TFA)&#8208;spiropyran (SP) chromophore. Green light selectively isomerizes TFA. SP ring&#8208;opening generates a transient phenolate intermediate, which dramatically accelerates the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of TFA by factors ranging from 102 to 106. This process is controlled by SP stimuli. This dynamic behavior is depicted as a molecular race along the &#8220;AZOBAHN&#8221;&#8211;a high&#8208;speed track where the usual limits of chemical reaction rates no longer apply.

A defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese molecular catalyst was designed to determine the water&#8208;binding and &#8208;activating sites of birnessite at the atomic level, which is key for the high oxygen&#8208;evolving activity of manganese oxides electrocatalysts. Blocking those active sites, in contrast, is profoundly destructive of their catalytic capability. Details are reported by Gang Wu et al. in their Communication (e202511664).

         <title>From Light to Cure: Precision Phototherapies for Antibiotic&#8208;Refractory Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Bacterial biofilms, formidable barriers to antimicrobial resistance, are prime targets for phototherapies: PTT (local hyperthermia) and PDT (ROS generation). This review examines these approaches and their combinatorial strategies, addressing clinical translation challenges and advancing antibiotic&#8208;independent infection management.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilms serve as formidable barriers in antimicrobial therapy and are central to the emergence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance. Their compact extracellular polymeric matrix, metabolic heterogeneity, and quorum&#8208;sensing&#8211;mediated resistance gene expression collectively endow biofilms with exceptional defense against conventional antibiotics. This review highlights the structural&#8208;functional complexity of biofilms and focuses on emerging phototherapeutic strategies&#8212;photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;as promising biofilm&#8208;targeted approaches. PTT employs near&#8208;infrared light to induce localized hyperthermia, disrupting bacterial membranes and enhancing drug penetration. PDT generates reactive oxygen species via photoactivated photosensitizers, leading to oxidative destruction of both cells and extracellular polymeric substances. These strategies offer metabolic independence, precise spatiotemporal control, and efficacy against dormant pathogens. Recent advances in smart nanoplatforms enable the integration of PTT/PDT with responsive drug delivery, imaging guidance, and immune modulation, achieving multimodal, precision antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, synergistic combinations with enzymatic degradation, immune intervention, and antibiotics show promise in treating chronic and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. We conclude by outlining translational challenges and strategic directions for clinical application, underscoring the potential of phototherapy to reshape infection management beyond antibiotic dependence.

         <title>Harnessing Phenonium Ions in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenonium ions have frequently been viewed as intermediates of theoretical interest, but whose synthetic utility was limited. This minireview outlines how physical&#8208;organic characterization has led to a better understanding of controlling their formation, which has resulted in modern strategies to form phenonium ions straightforwardly and use them in a synthetically useful manner.








Abstract
Whereas phenonium ions have been known for decades, their use in synthesis has been surprisingly scarce. This might be attributed to the difficulty in taming their formation and reactivity. However, by considering the physical&#8208;organic properties of phenonium species, through careful design of substrates, or the use of defined reagents/promoter systems, several applications have emerged in recent years to overcome those challenges. This minireview encompasses key recent strategies to generate those highly reactive cationic intermediates in line with their physicochemical properties, with special emphasis on mechanistic aspects, regioselectivity, and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Lower Critical Solution Temperature Active Supramolecular &#960;&#8208;Systems for Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we discuss Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) active supramolecular &#960;&#8208;systems for designing thermoresponsive smart windows, molecular thermometers, and biomedical systems. A critical analysis of such materials and their mechanistic understanding is important for future developments. This minireview outlines both the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems have emerged as an essential requirement for a wide range of smart applications in material sciences and biology. Among various responses, thermal response is a common functional characteristic of macromolecular and supramolecular systems. For example, polyacrylamides and their variants are known to exhibit a phenomenon called lower critical solution temperature (LCST) under aqueous conditions, which is a heat&#8208;induced phase change from a transparent to opaque state.

&lt;p&gt;In this minireview, we discuss Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) active supramolecular &#960;-systems for designing thermoresponsive smart windows, molecular thermometers, and biomedical systems. A critical analysis of such materials and their mechanistic understanding is important for future developments. This minireview outlines both the opportunities and challenges in this emerging field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive supramolecular systems have emerged as an essential requirement for a wide range of smart applications in material sciences and biology. Among various responses, thermal response is a common functional characteristic of macromolecular and supramolecular systems. For example, polyacrylamides and their variants are known to exhibit a phenomenon called lower critical solution temperature (LCST) under aqueous conditions, which is a heat-induced phase change from a transparent to opaque state. Similarly, numerous amphiphilic supramolecular systems are known to exhibit LCST properties. &#960;-Conjugated molecules are emerging as preferred building blocks for the construction of LCST active supramolecular materials owing to their inherent electronic and optical properties, which are sensitive to temperature variations. A variety of amphiphilic &#960;-systems have been reported for the creation of dynamic and adaptive LCST materials, and a combined analysis of such materials is important for further developments. In this minireview, we describe how researchers have exploited the LCST property of supramolecular &#960;-systems for various smart applications, such as smart windows and nanothermometers, and discuss their future potential and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Responsible Use of Kinematic Models: Correspondence on &#8220;Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry&#8221;</title>

Kinematic models offer useful estimates of maximum energy output in ball milling, provided they are applied with accurate parameters and appropriate caution of the model's assumptions and limitations.








Abstract
In their recent article, Jafter et&#160;al. present &#8220;refined&#8221; kinematic models for planetary and mixer mills. While the improvement of such models is a valuable pursuit, we find that aspects of the presentation and application of these models raise concerns. The authors modify an existing planetary mill model, yet the altered equations offer no clear advantage and obscure the underlying milling dynamics. The mixer mill model is similar to known models, but includes additional parameters, such as an empirical scaling factor, that lack theoretical justification. Furthermore, the models are applied using estimated or hypothetical values for important milling parameters, contributing to overestimations of the energy metrics. Rather than dismissing the use of kinematic models, we emphasize the importance of applying them with care by using accurate input parameters, being aware of their assumptions and limitations, and interpreting their outputs in the context of what the energy metrics represent (maximum energies released from impacts). When employed responsibly, kinematic models can provide valuable insight, and thus, we encourage a more rigorous and transparent application of these models to support the broader goal of reproducibility in mechanochemistry.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Ubiquitin Probes Capture the Sulfenylated State of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic ubiquitin&#8208;based probe, Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2, was developed to selectively label sulfenylated deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH). The probe demonstrated high specificity in vitro and enabled the identification of 13 oxidized DUBs in H2O2&#8208;treated 293T cell lysates via label&#8208;free proteomics, offering a new approach to study redox&#8208;regulated DUB activity.








Abstract
Activity&#8208;based ubiquitin probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) are powerful tools for studying the functional landscape of deubiquitinases (DUBs). While most existing Ub probes have focused on examining the native state of DUBs, oxidative stress, especially in cancer and inflammatory contexts, can oxidize the catalytic cysteine of DUBs, significantly altering their activity. Here, we developed three novel ubiquitin&#8208;based activity probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) to selectively trap the sulfenylated form of deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH). These probes employ ubiquitin as the recognition element and incorporate distinct warheads: an electrophilic norbornene moiety (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;NMA) or dimedone&#8208;derived cyclic C&#8208;nucleophiles (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2), enabling covalent capture of oxidized cysteine residues. Of these, Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 successfully labeled DUB&#8208;SOH, highlighting the importance of proper probe&#8208;substrate interaction for effective trapping. Optimization of the ubiquitin length showed that the Ub74 variant displayed enhanced affinity toward DUB&#8208;SOH. Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 enabled enrichment and identification of DUB&#8208;SOH targets via immunocapture and label&#8208;free quantitative proteomics. Collectively, these sulfenic acid&#8208;targeting Ub&#8208;ABPs represent versatile tools for elucidating redox&#8208;dependent DUB regulation, with potential applications in understanding redox dysregulation in disease contexts.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of a Diterpene Synthase for Chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E from Chryseobacterium Joostei</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bacterial diterpene synthase CjCS for chryseojoostenes was mechanistically characterised through labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and conversion of substrate analogs with blocked reactivity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis gave access to minor enzyme products, including chryseojoostene E, whose biosynthesis involves a long&#8208;range hydrogen shift that is also relevant to its EIMS fragmentation.








Abstract
A diterpene synthase from Chryseobacterium joostei was characterised and produces the five unique compounds chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E. Chryseojoostenes D and E were produced in too low amounts for isolation from the wildtype enzyme, but extensive site&#8208;directed mutagenesis resulted in an enzyme variant in which the production of these compounds was enhanced. The biosynthesis of the enzyme products was investigated in detail through a combined experimental and computational approach, indicating a complex hydrogen scrambling during terpene cyclisation and a long&#8208;range proton shift towards chryseojoostene E. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a similar long range hydrogen shift is involved in the formation of an even fragment ion (m/z 216), characterising the unique chemistry of the chryseojoostene skeleton. Further insights into the cyclisation mechanism were obtained by enzymatic conversion of two substrate analogs with reduced reactivity.

Further insights into the cyclisation mechanism were obtained by enzymatic conversion of two substrate analogs with reduced reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Reduction Reactions Through Sequential Anion Insertion and Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reduction reactions allow the preparation of metastable materials containing low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metal cations. By adopting a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regioselectivity of these reactions can be modified, allowing the connectivity of the transition&#8208;metal coordination polyhedra in the resulting materials (1D vs. 2D) to be controlled.








Abstract
Topochemical reduction of the n&#160;=&#160;2 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide, LaSr2CoRuO7, yields LaSr2CoRuO5.3, a phase containing (Co/Ru)O4 squares which share corners to form 1D infinite double&#8208;chains. In contrast, fluorination of LaSr2CoRuO7 yields the oxyfluoride LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5, which can then be reduced to form LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5. This reduced oxyfluoride is almost isoelectronic with LaSr2CoRuO5.3, but LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 has a crystal structure in which the (Co/Ru)O4 squares are connected into 2D infinite sheets. Thus, by following a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regiochemistry of topochemical reduction reactions can be modified, and compounds with different transition&#8208;metal&#8208;centre interconnectivity can be prepared. Both LaSr2CoRuO5.3 and LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 adopt glassy magnetic states at low temperature, but the magnetic interactions present in LaSr2CoRuO5.3 appear to be significantly stronger than those in LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5, attributable to the differing dimensionality of the transition&#8208;metal connectivity. The structural features of LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5 that modify the regioselectivity of the topochemical reduction reaction appear to be common to many fluorinated Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxides, suggesting this fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce strategy could be used to prepare a range of &#8220;infinite&#8208;layer&#8221; reduced phases which cannot be made by direct reduction of Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide precursors.

         <title>Bullvalene&#8208;Containing Molecular Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalenes (BVs) undergo rapid pericyclic rearrangements between a network of constitutional isomers with a variety of different shapes. Their inherent covalent disorder lends them to form molecular glasses. We find that their inclusion in the structures of glass&#8208;forming materials results in an increase in the thermal expansion coefficient.








Abstract
Organic molecular glasses are attractive matrices to disperse active ingredients in pharmaceuticals or electronic devices. Typically, they i) have lower glass transition temperatures than inorganic or polymeric glasses, making them easier to process, and ii) are less prone to phase segregation from other organic active materials. However, there is a dearth of functional groups that are known to induce glass formation in preference to crystallization. We have investigated the relationship between the shapeshifting isomerism of heterodisubstituted bullvalenes (BVs) and their properties as amorphous molecular glasses. Substituting a constitutionally dynamic BV unit in place of the 1,4&#8208;phenylene motif in the molecular structures of two well&#8208;known liquid crystal mesogens, 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;butylbiphenyl, produces materials that readily form glasses. The properties of the two glasses are compared to analogous glasses with fixed constitutions. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), we show that, unlike the fixed&#8208;structure glasses, the BV&#8208;containing molecular glasses fracture at low temperatures, which is indicative of them having larger thermal expansion coefficients. This article highlights the capability of shapeshifting building blocks to induce glass formation and to alter the physical properties of the resulting molecular materials, producing macroscopic effects that are observable by eye.

Achieving &#197;ngstrom&#8208;precise interlayer control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains elusive. We demonstrate water&#8208;based engineering of bilayer SOFs using length&#8208;tunable bipyridine pillars (L2/L3). Coordination&#8208;driven assembly with a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF yields crystalline bilayers with thicknesses of 5.4&#160;and 6.7&#160;nm&#8212;validated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This pillar&#8208;length&#8208;to&#8208;spacing correlation enables sub&#8208;nm precision, opening avenues for tailored interlayer environments.








Abstract
Achieving quantitative control over interlayer spacing in multilayer two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a&#160;molecular pillar engineering strategy&#160;enabling programmable vertical expansion of bilayer architectures. By designing elongated bipyridine pillars&#160;L2/L3&#160;(3.0/4.4&#160;nm) with hydrophilic side chains, we transform a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF (ml&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF, 1.8&#160;nm) into bilayers with&#160;precision&#8208;tuned&#160;thicknesses:&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;2&#160;(5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm) and&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;3&#160;(6.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;nm). Synchrotron small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) lattice imaging, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirm structural regularity with&#160;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level accuracy&#160;in layer spacing. Crucially, we establish a&#160;linear correlation between pillar length and interlayer distance, while multivalency&#8208;driven assembly ensures&#160;&gt;93% bilayer selectivity.

         <title>A Facile and Efficient Route to Achieve Polythiophene&#8208;Based Nanoparticles With Various Morphologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythiophene&#8208;based nanoparticles with abundant morphologies are efficiently fabricated by template synthesis strategy, which involves the fabrication of morphology precursors via PISA technique and their further oxidative polymerization. This strategy creates opportunities to obtain conjugated polymer nanoparticles with tunable morphologies and offers a powerful approach for large&#8208;scale fabrication to expand their application in future.








Abstract
Polythiophene&#8208;based nanoparticles (PTNPs), a prominent class of conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) with remarkable optical and electronic properties, have gained significant attention in applications such as electronics and bioimaging. However, current methods in generating PTNPs have run into obstacles including low variety of morphologies, poor reproducibility, and low preparation efficiency, restricting their further application. In this study, we report a facile and efficient fabrication strategy based on template synthesis method. This method combines polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) for the preparation of morphology precursors (PTN&#8208;templates) with subsequent oxidative polymerization to realize the construction of PTNPs. By systematically regulating composition, charge characteristics of hydrophilic segments, and solids content of the polymerization mixtures during RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA, a wide variety of PTN&#8208;templates with various morphologies were obtained. The successful synthesis of PTNPs with representative morphologies was confirmed through morphology retention, the formation of polythiophene chains, and the observed red shift in UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. In summary, we have established important guidelines for efficient fabrication of PTNPs with diverse morphologies, which opens up new avenues for the synthesis of next&#8208;generation conjugated polymer nanomaterials and offers the opportunity for the large&#8208;scale preparation of conjugated polymer nanomaterials.

This strategy creates opportunities to obtain conjugated polymer nanoparticles with tunable morphologies and offers a powerful approach for large-scale fabrication to expand their application in future.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polythiophene-based nanoparticles (PTNPs), a prominent class of conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) with remarkable optical and electronic properties, have gained significant attention in applications such as electronics and bioimaging. However, current methods in generating PTNPs have run into obstacles including low variety of morphologies, poor reproducibility, and low preparation efficiency, restricting their further application. In this study, we report a facile and efficient fabrication strategy based on template synthesis method. This method combines polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) for the preparation of morphology precursors (PTN-templates) with subsequent oxidative polymerization to realize the construction of PTNPs. By systematically regulating composition, charge characteristics of hydrophilic segments, and solids content of the polymerization mixtures during RAFT-mediated PISA, a wide variety of PTN-templates with various morphologies were obtained. The successful synthesis of PTNPs with representative morphologies was confirmed through morphology retention, the formation of polythiophene chains, and the observed red shift in UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. In summary, we have established important guidelines for efficient fabrication of PTNPs with diverse morphologies, which opens up new avenues for the synthesis of next-generation conjugated polymer nanomaterials and offers the opportunity for the large-scale preparation of conjugated polymer nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transforming Crowded Coacervates into Multi&#8208;Compartmental Hybrid Microreactors for Practical Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Multicompartmental protocell models with complex architectures are constructed through a versatile structural transformation from membrane&#8208;free coacervates to robust hybrid microreactors, which enables spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency.








Abstract
Advancing the design and construction of artificial protocells with organized complexity, diverse functionality and practical applicability is urgently demanded in vitro synthetic biology and bioengineering but remains a grand challenge. Here, we present a versatile Pickering emulsion&#8208;based encapsulation approach to transform membraneless coacervate compartments into robust multicompartmental hybrid microreactors, which concurrently assimilate the expected attributes of hierarchically compartmentalized structure, molecularly crowded environment, selectively permeable ability and mechanically reinforced stability. Single or multiple biological and non&#8208;biological catalytic species can be spatially sequestered in specific domains of the hybrid microreactor, enabling spatiotemporal regulation of individual biocatalysis or divergent cascades with high reaction efficiency. As proof of concept, we not only demonstrate the markedly improved catalytic activity (1.9&#8211;9.2 folds enhancement), strengthened thermostability (up to 100&#160;&#176;C) and impressive long&#8208;term durability (1600&#160;h) of the obtained microreactors in lipase&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of alcohol medicine intermediates, but also showcase their superior capability in processing chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade of ketone hydrogenation&#8208;kinetic resolution and multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade of oxidation reactions. Macromolecular crowding and confinement effects arising from structural features of the hybrid microreactors are identified as the dominant factors for the promotion of catalytic functions.

         <title>Polymerization of L&#8208;Arginine into Nanomicelles for Immunometabolic Engineering of Adoptive Macrophages in Solid Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of regulating immunometabolism of adoptive macrophages in vivo is reported by synthesizing L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based polymeric nanomicelles and integrating them within macrophages (PLANO@M&#248;). PLANO@M&#248; could display augmented tumor&#8208;killing potential and induce robust immune response. In the 4T1 murine model, PLANO@M&#248; showed an obvious inhibition effect on tumor progression.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of adoptive cell therapy is highly dependent on the status and function of the infused cells. However, insufficient nutrient availability within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) often impedes these cells from fully exerting their cytotoxic potential against solid tumors. Here, we present a strategy of integrating adoptively transferred macrophages with intracellular nutrient depots composed of L&#8208;arginine&#8208;based nanomicelles to provide a sustainable supply of essential metabolite and optimize the cellular activity in the nutrient&#8208;deprived TME. Also, the nanomicelles were coated with bacterial outer membrane vesicles to endow them with immunomodulatory capability, which could activate macrophages toward anti&#8208;tumor phenotypes and resist immune suppression. We showed that our approach significantly strengthened the tumor&#8208;killing potential of macrophages, induced robust immune responses, and effectively inhibited solid tumor growth compared to the administration of an equal dose of macrophages without immunometabolic modulation. This work provides a method for orchestrating the behavior of transferred cells in vivo, offering a promising strategy to better unleash the potential of adoptive cell therapies against solid tumors.

         <title>P450 Enzyme LyoI Performs Hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bifuran Oxidation in the Polyether Ionophore Lysocellin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a study of the biosynthesis of the polyether ionophore lysocellin, the P450 enzyme LyoI was found to catalyze a rare oxidation of a hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran moiety to its hemiketal form. The oxidation was identified as the key for unlocking the bioactivity of lysocellin. The sequence of LyoI lacks a key acidic residue, essential for its oxidative capabilities, which was utilized to identify a range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes.








Abstract
Polyether ionophores are potent antimicrobials, albeit also cytotoxic against mammalian cells. We have identified several polyether ionophores containing a common hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol (hemiketal) moiety, which cannot be derived from the canonical biosynthetic steps observed for the compound class, suggesting an unusual oxidative transformation. To identify the responsible enzyme, we applied CRISPR&#8211;BEST to knock out genes in the lysocellin&#8208;producing strain S. longwoodensis. This allowed us to propose the first annotation of the lysocellin biosynthetic gene cluster and identify the responsible P450 enzyme, LyoI, through reconstitution of the function in vivo. LyoI knockout provided access to the non&#8208;oxidized precursor (pre&#8208;lysocellin) which allowed both in vitro validation of the unusual direct hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran to hydro&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran&#8208;2&#8208;ol oxidation and investigation of the impact on biological activity. Interestingly, absence of the LyoI&#8208;mediated oxidation greatly reduced the biological potency of the compound. Closer investigation of the sequence revealed that LyoI lacks a key conserved acidic residue, which proved essential for the unusual oxidative function of the enzyme. Through a sequence similarity network of LyoI, we were able to identify a wide range of non&#8208;canonical P450 enzymes, highlighting the possibilities of a biosynthesis&#8208;focused approach to discovering novel enzymes.

         <title>&#8220;Twisted&#8221; Terpolymer Donor Enabling High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a new strategy to enhance the stretchability and photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) simultaneously by twisting the conjugated backbone of polymer donors. Efficient OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3% with a remarkable crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 23.8% are fabricated. Moreover, the intrinsically stretchable OSCs (is&#8208;OSCs) achieved a PCE of 14.2% and excellent stretchability with a strain at PCE80% of 31.0%, ranking among the highest values.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (is&#8208;OSCs) hold great potential for next&#8208;generation wearable power generators. Currently, high&#8208;efficiency polymeric donor materials are based on rigid planar conjugated backbones, which limits their mechanical robustness and creates a trade&#8208;off between photovoltaic performance and stretchability. To simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness of is&#8208;OSCs, we develop a series of ductile PM&#8208;BOX% terpolymers by incorporating different amounts (X&#160;=&#160;5, 10, and 20) of 3&#8208;butyloctyl&#8208;thiophene (ThBO) units into PM6 backbone. The BO alkyl side chains appended on Th&#8208;BO units induce a more significant twist in the backbone compared to PM6, which increases the disordered contents and facilitates the stress dissipation, hence enhancing the mechanical stretchability. While the conjugated thiophene unit preserves the &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, maintaining efficient charge transport. As a result, the PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based devices outperform the PM6&#8208;based ones, achieving a higher PCE of 18.3% and a superior crack&#8208;onset strain of 23.8%. Additionally, PM&#8208;BO10%:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based is&#8208;OSCs reach a PCE of 14.2% with an excellent PCE retention (80% of its initial PCE at 31.0% strain), marking one of the highest values for is&#8208;OSCs. This twisted terpolymer design strategy paves a novel way for designing efficient polymer donors with excellent stretchability for the application in is&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Crystallization Strategy for Direct Enzyme Encapsulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs: Eliminating Harsh pH and Thermal Requirements of Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis</title>

Robust Zr&#8208;MOFs synthesized via aqueous solid&#8208;state routes enabling one&#8208;pot enzyme encapsulation and enhanced catalytic stability in harsh conditions.








Abstract
Conventional syntheses of robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) rely on harsh solvothermal conditions, precluding the inclusion of fragile functionalities such as enzymes or organisms. Therefore, developing routes to such stable frameworks under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a mild aqueous solid&#8208;state crystallization (SSC) strategy that enables Zr&#8208;MOF assembly at ambient temperature. This approach transforms an amorphous precursor into a crystalline framework via water&#8208;mediated dynamic ligand exchange. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal an acid&#8208;catalyzed associative substitution mechanism at Zr6 nodes, in which formate modulators are protonated and displaced by fumarate linkers, driving MOF&#8208;801 crystallization without external heating or organic solvent. We further apply this SSC method to other Zr&#8208;MOFs, including functionalized UiO&#8208;66 analogues, establishing it as a general model for ambient MOF assembly. This amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline transformation represents a new synthetic paradigm for constructing stable porous frameworks under biocompatible conditions and enables the integration of sensitive biomolecules (e.g., enzymes) into robust MOFs. In addition, this method for MOF&#8208;801 formation is universally adaptable for encapsulating various proteins. The enzyme@Zr&#8208;MOF composites significantly enhance enzyme stability in catalytic reactions involving acidic products, demonstrating the necessity of robust Zr&#8208;MOF shells.

         <title>Semiconductor Cluster with High Reduction Potential and Efficient Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Activation of Inert Organic Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideal semiconductor&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalytic platform is exemplified to clarify the critical balance between kinetics and thermodynamics in inert substrate activation from the perspective of the Marcus charge transfer theory. This balance endows the proposed protocol with remarkable versatility, enabling the dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and hydrodehalogenation of challenging aryl/alkyl chlorides and fluorides, along with arylation and amination under visible light.








Abstract
Photoredox catalysis is an essential component of modern organic synthesis. However, current photocatalysts face the challenge of simultaneously requiring strong redox potentials and efficient charge transfer to meet the thermodynamic and kinetic demands of photoinduced electron transfer processes. Herein, we present an excellent reactivity mode for photocatalysis based on semiconductor clusters, exploiting the ideal Marcus parabola to couple potential and kinetic requirements. Our system demonstrates an exceptionally high negative reduction potential (Ered) (&#8722;2.94&#160;V versus SCE, on par with K0) and realizes efficient charge transfer&#8212;rapid charge separation (CS) and slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics. This duality endows the protocol with remarkable versatility by enabling the dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and reductive dehalogenation of challenging aryl/alkyl chlorides and aryl fluorides, as well as arylation and amination, with a high functional group tolerance under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Furthermore, this platform offers easy recyclability, supports gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and can be extended to the late&#8208;stage functionalization and deuteration of drugs. This innovative catalytic platform provides a new approach for the photochemical activation of inert organic substrates and is foreseen to promote the development of radical reaction&#8208;based pharmaceutical synthesis.

         <title>Control Over S(VI) Stereogenicity for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Sulfonimidoyl Derivatives by Isothiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Covalent Activation of Sulfur(VI) Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent activation of racemic sulfonimidoyl chlorides via an isothiourea&#8208;derived sulfonimidoyl intermediate is disclosed for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic sulfonimidates. The enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates for efficient sulfur(VI)&#8208;phenolate exchange in the construction of a wide range of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides.








Abstract
In contrast to the notable advancements focusing on the preparation of optically enriched S(IV) frameworks in recent years, achieving catalyst stereocontrol over S(VI) stereogenicity to generate chiral S(VI) scaffolds remains a largely underexplored challenge. Herein, we document a new activation mode of isothiourea organocatalysis for the highly enantioselective synthesis of S(VI)&#8208;chiral sulfonimidates. This method involves the covalent activation of racemic S(VI) sulfonimidoyl chlorides through the formation of a pivotal isothiourea&#8208;bound sulfonimidoyl intermediate. The newly formed S(VI)&#8208;based isothiourea reactive species further governs the subsequent asymmetric S&#9472;O bond formation to afford the chiral sulfonimidate products with high yields and selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the facile inversion of the tetrasubstituted S(VI) stereogenic center assisted by the chiral catalyst is crucial in the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) process. Notably, distinct from the extensively studied isothiourea catalysis focused on the activation of &#8220;C&#8221;&#8208;centered substrates, our method introduces a novel S&#8208;atom activation approach, enabling the efficient construction of S(VI) stereogenic centers. Furthermore, the obtained enantioenriched sulfonimidates serve as linchpin intermediates in efficient sulfur&#8208;phenolate exchange for rapid access to diverse S(VI)&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides, and their derivatives, with notable antimicrobial activity against various plant pathogens.

         <title>In&#8208;Built Compatible Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;SPAN Batteries</title>

A in&#8208;situ polymerized interface is successfully constructed between solid polymer electrolytes and electrodes. Al(OTf)3 in the electrolyte initiates 1,3&#8208;dioxolane polymerization to lower interfacial impedance, while fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;derived CEI suppresses sulfurized polyacrylonitrile&#8217;s shuttle effect. This enables the Li&#8208;S battery to retain 90% capacity after 200 cycles at 0.5C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have been regarded as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and low cost. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) as a cathode material has received wide interest due to the solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism, while the Li&#8208;SPAN cell performance has been limited by the notorious issue of lithium metal anode. Developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with favorable electrode&#8208;electrolyte compatibility is urgently desired. Herein, we demonstrate a dual&#8208;interface optimization strategy through in&#8208;situ polymerization interface construction, which synergistically enhances interfacial compatibility between the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and both the lithium metal anode and SPAN cathode. The initiator pre&#8208;buried in the SPE triggers the in&#8208;situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) at the interface, thereby greatly reducing the electrode/electrolyte interfacial impedance. Additionally, the released fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) into the poly&#8208;DOL interface could further reduce the impedance and enhance the interface stability during cycling, simultaneously preventing the dissolution of polysulfides, owing to the inorganic&#8208;rich and dense cathode electrolyte interphase formed on SPAN. As a result, the Li&#8208;SPAN cell could operate more than 200 cycles at 0.5C with a capacity retention of 90%. We believe that this strategy provides prospects for the development of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Chiral Molecules Induce Enantiomorphic Lattice Helicity in Chiral 0D Tin Bromide Crystals</title>

Chiral (R&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 and (S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 metal halides crystallize in enantiomorphic helical space groups P61 and P65, respectively. The helical orientation of chiral molecules in the lattice arises due to strong N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and is visualized via sixfold symmetry. The crystals show mirror&#8208;image CD spectra (g&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and circularly polarized SHG with a dissymmetry factor (gCP&#8211;SHG) up to 0.44.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have emerged as a promising class of materials for spin&#8208;controlled optical and optoelectronic effects and related applications. Chiral hybrid metal halides generally crystallize in non&#8208;helical space groups. Herein, we report the discovery of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral (R/S&#8208;MBA)2SnBr6 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium cation) single crystals with enantiomorphic lattice helicity. The S&#8208;enantiomer of the chiral molecule induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P61 space group (right&#8208;handed, P&#8208;helix), while the R&#8208;enantiomer induces right&#8208;handed helicity with the P65 space group (left&#8208;handed, M&#8208;helix). The chiral molecules induce the helical twist of inorganic units in the lattice through N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong electronic coupling between chiral molecules and SnBr62&#8722; subunits is responsible for the generation of chirality. The chiral crystals exhibit circular dicroism (CD) spectra with a high dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and no Cotton effect, maintaining the same CD sign throughout the spectrum. In addition, they exhibit broadband second harmonic generation (SHG) over a broad excitation range, with a gCP&#8208;SHG up to 0.44. Furthermore, we find that the alloying of Sn with Pb leads to a change in dimensionality from 0D to non&#8208;helical 1D structures. These crystals with helical lattices and interesting CD responses are expected to open new avenues for spin&#8208;controlled applications.

         <title>&#8220;Dual&#8208;Key&#8221;&#8208;Controlled Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Nanoprobe for Highly Precision Phototheranostics Under NIR&#8208;II Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

This study developed an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe with nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsiveness, permitting highly specific near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects.








Abstract
The development of activatable optical probes has proved to be a promising approach to improve the accuracy of phototheranostics. However, most such probes are usually responsive to single pathological factor and visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I light upon activation, which restricts the theranostic specificity and tissue penetration depth, respectively. Herein, we develop a nitric oxide (NO) and acidity dual&#8208;stimuli responsive semiconducting polymer nanoprobe for activatable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Specifically, a weak electron acceptor (benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;5,6&#8208;diamine, BT2NH2) has been conjugated with diketopyrrolopyrrole to construct the pathological factor&#8208;sensitive molecular probe. Upon the coactivation of NO and acidity, the BT2NH2 is oxidized to generate a strong electron acceptor (5H&#8208;[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;f]&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, BT3N), leading to the absorption enhancement in the NIR&#8208;II region. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate the successful activation of the probe toward activated macrophages, various cancer cells, drug&#8208;induced liver injury, and breast cancer to output enhanced NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic and photothermal signals, permitting highly specific PAI and PTT with reduced background interference and minimal therapeutic side effects. By virtue of the improved specificity and superior penetration depth, the dual&#8208;stimuli responsive NIR&#8208;II probe has broad prospects for precise visualization and intervention toward NO and acid&#8208;associated pathological and physiological events from deep tissues.

         <title>A Tertiary Amine&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Methylation&#8208;Mediated Steric and Electronic Synergy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N, N&#8208;dimethylurethane (NDMUE), which is formed by methylating the &#945;&#8208;H atoms on the urethane (UE) and N&#8208;methylurethane molecules, results in an increase in steric hindrance and the formation of a hyper&#8208;conjugated structure. This facilitates more anions to participate in Li+ coordination and enhances the stability of the lithium metal, enabling a 3.0&#8208;Ah LiFePO4||Li pouch cell with excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
The application of the amine&#8208;based solvents (AS) in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) electrolyte is hindered by the severe parasitic reactions between active hydrogen and Li metal. In this study, we synthesized a methylated AS (N, N&#8208;dimethylurethane, NDMUE), by replacing the reactive hydrogen with a methyl group. We further demonstrated its performance as a single&#8208;component solvent for LMB electrolytes. Its performance as a single&#8208;component solvent for LMB electrolytes was demonstrated. The methyl substitution was found to enhance steric hindrance and introduce a hyper&#8208;conjugated structure, Its weak solvent &#9472;Li+ interactions promote anion&#8208;dominated solvation, and facilitating controlled solvent reduction. This molecular modification leads to a mechanically robust bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal anode through the sequential reduction processes: the anion&#8208;driven reduction produced an inner inorganic layer, while the ester moiety contributed to an outer organic layer. Together, these layers effectively suppressed dendrite growth. As a result, we demonstrated outstanding cycling performance with a 3&#8208;Ah LiFePO4||Li pouch cell using the NDMUE&#8208;based electrolyte, retaining nearly 100% of its capacity after 273 cycles at 0.2 C. This work establishes a rational design strategy for amine&#8208;derived electrolytes and provides a fundamental framework for developing advanced electrolyte systems in durable LMBs.

         <title>Synergistic Construction of In Situ Self&#8208;Polymerized Interface and Localized pH Buffer Zone for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional electrolyte pH buffer, valerolactam, was developed to stabilize the zinc anode, regulate interfacial pH, self&#8208;polymerize into a robust SEI layer, and suppress polyiodide shuttling, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical use is hindered by challenges such as Zn dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion, and polyiodide shuttle effect. In this study, valerolactam (VL) is employed as an organic pH buffer to address these issues. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that VL can regulate the electrolyte local pH while in situ polymerizing on the electrode surface to form a mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protection layer, effectively suppressing HER, corrosion, and dendrite growth. Furthermore, the introduction of VL significantly regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, and disrupts the inherent hydrogen bonding network, which enhances the electrochemical performance. As a result, a symmetric cell with VL&#8208;based electrolyte achieves impressive longevity under ultra&#8208;high current density (4000 cycles at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), 4.3 times higher than the counterpart in the conventional ZnSO4 electrolytes. Moreover, VL effectively suppresses polyiodide shuttle effect and improves electrochemical stability. Consequently, Zn&#8211;I2 full battery exhibits exceptional cycling stability, sustaining 26&#160;500 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.4%. Therefore, organic pH buffering engineering has been proved to be a promising strategy for achieving dendrite&#8208;free, shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional electrolyte pH buffer, valerolactam, was developed to stabilize the zinc anode, regulate interfacial pH, self-polymerize into a robust SEI layer, and suppress polyiodide shuttling, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of aqueous Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries are promising for large-scale energy storage. However, their practical use is hindered by challenges such as Zn dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion, and polyiodide shuttle effect. In this study, valerolactam (VL) is employed as an organic pH buffer to address these issues. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that VL can regulate the electrolyte local pH while in situ polymerizing on the electrode surface to form a mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protection layer, effectively suppressing HER, corrosion, and dendrite growth. Furthermore, the introduction of VL significantly regulates the solvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and disrupts the inherent hydrogen bonding network, which enhances the electrochemical performance. As a result, a symmetric cell with VL-based electrolyte achieves impressive longevity under ultra-high current density (4000 cycles at 40&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 4.3 times higher than the counterpart in the conventional ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes. Moreover, VL effectively suppresses polyiodide shuttle effect and improves electrochemical stability. Consequently, Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full battery exhibits exceptional cycling stability, sustaining 26&#160;500 cycles with a high-capacity retention of 86.4%. Therefore, organic pH buffering engineering has been proved to be a promising strategy for achieving dendrite-free, shuttle-free Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Surface Concentrations of Building Units to Enable the Cathodic Deposition of Metastable ZIF&#8208;L Films for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic deposition enables the formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films, yet precise control of surface building&#8208;unit concentrations remain challenging. By finely tuning these concentrations, metastable ZIF&#8208;L membranes are obtained with high gas separation performance. This approach establishes a general strategy for regulating building units under negative bias, applicable to other surface&#8208;sensitive MOFs.








Abstract
Cathodic deposition is an emerging technique for the preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films. However, monitoring and controlling the concentrations of MOF building units (i.e., metal nodes and ligands) on the electrode surface remains challenging and has yet to be reported. This limitation greatly hinders the application of this technique to the synthesis of MOFs sensitive to building unit concentrations, such as the well&#8208;known metastable ZIF&#8208;L. Here, using the cathodic deposition of ZIF&#8208;L films as an example, we demonstrate how the surface metal node and ligand concentrations influence ZIF&#8208;L film generation by utilizing in situ pH measurements and theoretical calculations. Also, we propose a strategy to regulate the concentrations of these building units, enabling the straightforward and rapid cathodic deposition of thin ZIF&#8208;L films. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) post&#8208;modification, the electrochemically deposited ZIF&#8208;L films on commercial anodized alumina oxide (AAO) substrate exhibit good gas separation performance, achieving a H2/N2 selectivity of 19.4 and a H2 permeance exceeding 360 GPU (1 GPU&#160;=&#160;3.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#8304; mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1 Pa&#8722;1).

         <title>Molecular Insights into Active Sites of Manganese Oxide Based Water Oxidation Eletrocatalysts</title>

Tri&#8208; and di&#8208;manganese model complexes are developed to mimic the in&#8208;plane and on&#8208;edge subunits of birnessite&#8208;like heterogeneous MnOx electrocatalysts. Electrochemical results indicate that the former acts as a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4&#8208;e WOR to produce O2 while the latter exhibits marginal catalytic activity on WOR, suggesting that the defective tri&#8208;nuclear cubical motif is most likely the active site of MnOx electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Manganese oxides (MnOx) are promising candidates for water oxidation catalysts. However, the true active centers remain elusive due to the dynamic nature of MnOx during electrolysis and/or activation, hindering progress in catalyst design and optimization. Herein, we aim to address such a challenge by preparing a defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex and a di&#8208;manganese complex to mimic the in&#8208;plane and on&#8208;edge subunits of birnessite&#8208;like heterogeneous MnOx electrocatalysts. Electrochemical results indicate that the defective cubical tri&#8208;manganese complex is a robust molecular catalyst to facilitate 4e&#8722; water oxidation to produce O2 with an optimal Faradic efficiency of 95% and an average rate of oxygen generation of 46.4&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest values of reported manganese&#8208;based molecular catalysts and is comparable with representative heterogeneous MnOx systems. In contrast, the di&#8208;manganese complex exhibits marginal catalytic activity. This work provides molecular insights into the true active centers of MnOx and aids in the precise design of more efficient MnOx water oxidation electrocatalysts.

         <title>Switching Enantioselectivity in Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase for the Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Deficient Aromatic d&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

Phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs) were engineered to switch enantioselectivity, enabling hydroamination for the direct synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AA). Structure&#8208;guided engineering provided PAL variants with broad substrate scope, high activity, and excellent d&#8208;selectivity, broadening the utility of PALs in asymmetric synthesis.








Abstract
Aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AAs) are valuable building blocks in drug discovery and peptide therapeutics, yet their direct and efficient biocatalytic synthesis remains a challenge. Here, we report the rational engineering of phenylalanine ammonia lyase from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL) to enable asymmetric hydroamination for the enantioselective synthesis of d&#8208;aromatic amino acids. By targeting active&#8208;site residue L205, we identified variants capable of highly d&#8208;enantioselective hydroamination, with L205F enabling the transformation of electron&#8208;deficient aryl acrylates with &gt;99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The synthetic utility of this platform was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis of d&#8208;benzoxazole and substituted 2&#8208;pyridylalanines. Structural and mutational studies revealed distinct roles for the 4&#8208;methylideneimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;one (MIO) prosthetic group and active&#8208;site residues L205, Y64, and K397 in modulating enantioselectivity. These results enabled the identification of PbPAL variants with the opposite selectivity, such as L205V&#8208;K397A, which preferentially produce l&#8208;amino acids. This work broadens the utility of PALs as programmable biocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Production with a Nearly 2% Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency via a Dedicated Construction of Redox Centers in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMFS&#8208;Cu showed excellent activity for H2O2 photosynthesis with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. The single&#8208;atom Cu sites in NMFS&#8208;Cu promote the formation of Cu&#8208;&#956;&#8208;peroxide (Cu&#8208;O2&#8722;) and desorption of *H2O2, leading to an efficient 2e&#8722; ORR pathway. The in situ generated O2 via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR resulting in a boosted photocatalytic generation of H2O2.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green oxidant widely used in a variety of industries. Photocatalytic generation of H2O2 from water and oxygen by sunlight is an appealing strategy compared to the high energy consumption of the industrial anthraquinone process. However, the low activity and selectivity of the two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the photocatalytic process greatly restricts the H2O2 production efficiency. Here, we demonstrated that the redox centers in MOFs (NMFS&#8208;M, single&#8208;atom M linked to an iron&#8208;oxo cluster in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe) by a molecular linker cysteine, M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for the production of H2O2 from water and oxygen. The optimal NMFS&#8208;Cu stably generates H2O2 under simulated sunlight irradiation with a nearly 2% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency under AM1.5 spectrum and an apparent quantum yield of 19.6% at 420&#160;nm. Combined with density functional theory calculations, isotopic experiments, and advanced spectroscopic characterizations, the high photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the notably promoted sequential two&#8208;step ORR to H2O2 by forming &#956;&#8208;peroxide and desorption of *H2O2 at the single&#8208;atom Cu sites.

&lt;p&gt;NMFS-Cu showed excellent activity for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis with a nearly 2% solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency. The single-atom Cu sites in NMFS-Cu promote the formation of Cu-&#956;-peroxide (Cu-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and desorption of *H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to an efficient 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR pathway. The in situ generated O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR resulting in a boosted photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a green oxidant widely used in a variety of industries. Photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water and oxygen by sunlight is an appealing strategy compared to the high energy consumption of the industrial anthraquinone process. However, the low activity and selectivity of the two-step single-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the photocatalytic process greatly restricts the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency. Here, we demonstrated that the redox centers in MOFs (NMFS-M, single-atom M linked to an iron-oxo cluster in NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101(Fe) by a molecular linker cysteine, M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water and oxygen. The optimal NMFS-Cu stably generates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under simulated sunlight irradiation with a nearly 2% solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency under AM1.5 spectrum and an apparent quantum yield of 19.6% at 420&#160;nm. Combined with density functional theory calculations, isotopic experiments, and advanced spectroscopic characterizations, the high photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the notably promoted sequential two-step ORR to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by forming &#956;-peroxide and desorption of *H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the single-atom Cu sites. The in situ generated O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via water oxidation reaction is rapidly consumed by ORR, leading to a boosted photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Electrocatalytic Coupling of Carbon Dioxide and Methanol for High&#8208;Efficiency Formic Acid Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation system employing CuBi cathode and NiCo anode enables efficient cogeneration of formic acid. The electron&#8208;rich Bi sites accelerate HCOO* formation, while low&#8208;coordination Co atoms enhance methanol oxidation. The coupled system delivers total Faradaic efficiencies of 189%&#8211;192% across 2.0&#8211;2.8 V, achieving sustainable and energy&#8208;efficient FA production.








Abstract
The coupling of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) presents a promising strategy for simultaneous cogeneration of formic acid (FA) at both cathode and anode. However, sluggish kinetics, low selectivity and efficiency hinder practical application. Herein, we demonstrate an integrated ECR||MOR system employing CuBi cathode and NiCo anode for energy&#8208;efficient FA cogeneration. The CuBi alloy achieves high Faradaic efficiencies (FE&#160;&gt;&#160;90%) for FA generation over an extensive potential range (&gt;400&#160;mV), attributed to the accelerated formation of HCOO* intermediates in facilitating FA production. Meanwhile, the NiCo alloy reached a remarkable FE of 97.5% for FA generation at 1.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, benefiting from rapid HCOO* intermediate formation that effectively mitigates CO toxicity. This unique system delivered a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 2.07&#160;V, representing a substantial reduction of 320&#160;mV compared to water electrolysis. Across a wide operational voltage window (2.0&#8211;2.8&#160;V), the system consistently delivered total Faradaic efficiencies ranging between 189% and 192%, alongside exceptional FA production capacities surpassing 400&#160;g kWh&#8722;1, which significantly outperformed traditional methods (&#8764;220&#160;g kWh&#8722;1). This work provides an efficient pathway for low&#8208;energy CO2 utilization and sustainable FA production.

         <title>TASK2&#8208;Inspired pH&#8208;Gating Polymeric Nanochannels with Multiple Interconvertible Permeability States by Synergistic Regulation of Conformation and Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic precise permeation regulation of biological ion channels, an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy is provided to build smart polymeric nanochannels with four ion permeability states in response to pH stimuli. Beneficial for synergy transformation of structure and charge properties, the nanochannels achieve pH&#8208;gating on&#8211;off switch of fast cation flux, superhigh cation/anion selectivity, and salinity&#8208;gradient energy transduction, respectively. 








Abstract
Biological ion channels can regulate finely the ion transmembrane permeation, with superhigh ion selectivity and on&#8211;off ion flux in response to external stimuli, for signal transduction and energy conversion. However, fabricating smart artificial nanochannels with analogous functions remain challenging by single design of structure or charge property. In vivo, function basis of pH&#8208;gated TWIK&#8208;related acid&#8208;sensitive K+ channel 2 (TASK2) channels is attributed to synergy control of geometrical conformation and surface potential for filter gates. With this inspiration, we report an extrinsic&#8208;gate composite strategy to construct biomimetic responsive nanochannels, based on dye&#8208;loading branched poly(piperidine)s. Two nanochannel models, negatively&#8208;charged large pores (0.76&#160;nm) and positively&#8208;charged small pores (0.49&#160;nm), can be switched quickly by external pH stimuli, due to protonation/deprotonation and conformation change of gates. Thereby, symmetric and asymmetric pH stimuli at the two sides of nanochannels achieve four distinct permeability states to various ions, respectively, to mimic inactivated, inhibited, rest, and activated states of TASK2 channels. Applying for salinity&#8208;gradient energy conversion, the high&#8208;selectivity/high&#8208;flux states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;3332) and low&#8208;selectivity and low&#8208;flux permeability states (SNa+/Cl&#8722;&#8764;0.33) act as an on&#8211;off switch of salinity&#8208;gradient energy nanogenerator, with superhigh energy conversion efficiency of &#8764;50%. This work suggests the potential of extrinsic&#8208;gate composite nanochannels for in vitro biomimetic applications.

         <title>Precisely Bonded Fe&#9472;Cu Diatomic Sites with Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged Coordination on Hollow C3N4 Spheres for Efficient C&#9472;N Coupling and Selective Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>

Hollow g&#8208;C3N4 spheres anchored with Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites enable efficient photocatalytic CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction via selective adsorption and synergistic C&#9472;N coupling. The Fe site activates CO2, while the Cu site stabilizes N2, facilitating *NCON intermediate formation. Atomic&#8208;level Fe&#9472;Cu coordination enhances charge separation, light harvesting, and multireactant activation for sustainable urea synthesis.








Abstract
The photocatalytic synthesis of urea from CO2 and N2 co&#8208;reduction presents a promising alternative to the conventional energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface often limits selectivity and yield. Here, we designed hollow graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) spheres, which serve as a high surface area scaffold for precise anchoring of Fe&#9472;Cu diatomic sites. Hollow architecture enhances light harvesting via inner&#8208;scattering effects and charge separation. Each Fe&#9472;Cu site is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms, forming N2&#9472;Fe1&#9472;Cu1&#9472;N2 /C3N4 DAC (hereafter referred to as FeCu/CN), which enables cooperative activation of CO2 and N2, in contrast to monodispersed diatomic (Fe+Cu/CN), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe/CN, Cu/CN). The FeCu/CN bonded pairs serve as highly efficient active centers, facilitating the synergistic adsorption and activation of multiple reactants. Specifically, during the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2, the Fe1 site preferentially adsorbs and activates CO2, while bonded Cu1 sites stabilize N2 on FeCu/CN and enable synergistic C&#9472;N coupling through the formation of *NCON intermediates. As a result, the FeCu/CN achieves an exceptional urea yield of 7.40&#160;mg&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with a 38.58% selectivity under visible light irradiation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atomic&#8208;level coordination in multireactants and offer insights into the C&#9472;N coupling for value&#8208;added products using CO2 and N2 as feedstock.

         <title>Halogenation&#8208;Engineered Acceptor Enables 20.14% Efficiency in Hydrocarbon&#8208;Solvent Processed OSCs: From Binary Trade&#8208;Offs to Ternary Synergy in Exciton and Energy Loss Management</title>

Halogenation engineering of benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors enables nonhalogenated solvent processed organic solar cells with an efficiency 20.14%, revealing how halogenation modulates intermolecular interactions, energy loss, and morphology.








Abstract
Halogenation emerges as a key strategy to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) by tuning molecular packing, energy levels, and charge dynamics. Here, we report three new benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;core small&#8208;molecule acceptors, namely NA5, NA6, and NA7, and systematically evaluate their photovoltaic properties in o&#8208;xylene&#8208;processed binary and ternary OSCs. Halogenation significantly strengthens intermolecular interactions, improves charge carrier mobility, and facilitates exciton dissociation, leading to a remarkable increase in binary device efficiencies from &#8764;2% (NA5) to over 17% (NA6, NA7). However, halogenation also increases charge&#8208;transfer state character, which can induce higher nonradiative recombination and energy loss. Despite this drawback, the enhanced driving force for charge separation and improved morphological order enabled by halogenation outweigh the negative effects on energy loss. Notably, incorporation of NA7 into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 ternary system optimizes blend morphology, suppresses nonradiative recombination, and thus achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 20.14% (certified 19.93%)&#8212;the highest reported for OSCs processed with hydrocarbon solvents. These findings highlight the dual role of halogenation in modulating both beneficial and detrimental aspects of device energetics, providing new insights into molecular design strategies for high&#8208;performance, environmental&#8208;friendly OSCs.

         <title>Cyclometalating Ligand Affords NIR Absorption in Ruthenium Complexes for Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing a cyclometalating ligand, we report &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP, which exhibits (metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer, resulting in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region absorption. The TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;donating capacity, promotes Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT), rendering it highly effective under hypoxic conditions. This work provides design principles for cyclometalated Ru (II) complexes with NIR absorption for Type&#8208;I PDT.








Abstract
The development of NIR photosensitizers (PSs) based on Ru complexes with Type&#8208;I process holds substantial promise for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer, though this breakthrough remains unrealized to date. Herein, a pair of cyclometalated Ru enantiomers, [&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;dqpy&#8208;TPABP]Cl (dqpy: 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine; TPABP: 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)triphenylamine) (&#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP), were synthesized and evaluated. These complexes exhibit strong Ru(d) and TPABP(&#960;) &#8594; dqpy(&#960;*) charge transfer ((metal and ligand)&#8211;ligand charge transfer; ML&#8211;LCT) absorption at &#8764;640&#160;nm, with an extended absorption tail reaching up to 800&#160;nm. Moreover, the TPABP ligand, with its strong electron&#8208;rich capacity, contributes to T1 formation, which increases the electron transfer possibility in the triplet state and promotes Type&#8208;I PDT, making it highly effective for killing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Further encapsulating &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPABP into polymeric nanoparticles results in high tumor inhibition efficiency (&gt;85%) and causes a strong tumoricidal effect and inhibits lung metastasis of breast tumors under 700&#160;nm light irradiation, thus offering a new strategy for developing NIR Ru complexes for anticancer treatment through the design of cyclometalating ligand.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [4+2]/Cheletropic Retro&#8208;[4+1] Cycloadditions of Thiophene S,S&#8208;Dioxides with 3&#8208;Substituted Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric IEDDA/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions, using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides (TDOs) and 3&#8208;substituted indoles as reaction partners, are realized by a chiral Fe(III)/BOX complex. A series of cyclohexa&#8208;fused tricyclic indolines bearing a bridgehead quaternary stereogenic center are synthesized in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by the concise total synthesis of pentacyclic Strychnos indole alkaloid (+)&#8208;geissoschizoline.








Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloadditions of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides are a prominent method for synthesizing unsaturated six&#8208;membered carbocycles. However, to the best of our knowledge, catalytic asymmetric variations of these reactions have not yet been achieved. Herein, we report Fe(III)&#8208;bis(oxazoline) complex&#8208;catalyzed inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand [4+2] cycloaddition/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] extrusion of SO2 reactions between thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides and 3&#8208;substituted indoles. The key to the success of this transformation involves using thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxide components bearing an N&#8208;acyloxazolidinone group at the C2 position, which coordinates with the chiral catalyst, and a halide group at the C5 position to prevent the self&#8208;dimerization of thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. Computational studies revealed that the [4+2] cycloaddition proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, with the subsequent retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition acting as a driving force to facilitate the initial [4+2] cycloaddition. This [4+2]/cheletropic retro&#8208;[4+1] cycloaddition reaction sequence enables the synthesis of a broad range of hexahydrocarbazoles bearing a quaternary stereogenic center, which are core structures in numerous families of indole alkaloids, in good yields with high enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated through diverse product transformations and a concise, enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;geissoschizoline.

Bio&#8208;inspired proton transport regulation via 5&#8208;fluorouracil tautomerism within sulfonated MOF&#8208;808 to reconcile the inherent trade&#8208;off between low activation energy and sustained proton mobility








Abstract
The strategic modulation of proton transport kinetics and precise control of migration energy barriers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are essential for developing next&#8208;generation proton conductors. Inspired by biological proton channels, this study introduces a dynamic regulation strategy by keto&#8208;enol tautomerism to reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between low activation energy (Ea) and sustained proton mobility. We successfully construct a hierarchical proton conductive system (denoted as FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H) by integrating 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) molecules into sulfonic&#8208;functionalized MOF&#8208;808 through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification. The enol tautomer of 5&#8208;FU reconfigures hydrogen&#8208;bond networks under humidity variations, synergizing with anchored &#9472;SO3H groups to establish proton transport pathways along ordered ionic channels (&#9472;SO3H&#183;&#183;&#183;H2O&#183;&#183;&#183;5&#8208;FU) and tautomerism&#8208;driven delocalization via reversible keto&#8208;enol isomerization. The optimized compound FU@MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H exhibits a high proton conductivity of 7.15&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and 95% RH, representing an approximate 300&#8208;fold enhancement over pristine MOF&#8208;808, a 15&#8208;fold improvement versus the 5&#8208;FU&#8208;encapsulated analogue FU@MOF&#8208;808, and the sulfonated framework MOF&#8208;808&#8208;SO3H. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate an ultra&#8208;low formation energy barrier (9.05 and 1.59&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1) from keto to enol conversion, attributed to sulfonic acid stabilization of protonated transition states. Furthermore, the proton conductive mechanism is visually corroborated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, suggesting Grotthuss&#8208;dominated proton migration within hydrated nanochannels, aligning with experimental results.

&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and sustained proton mobility. We successfully construct a hierarchical proton conductive system (denoted as &lt;b&gt;FU@MOF-808-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;) by integrating 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) molecules into sulfonic-functionalized &lt;b&gt;MOF-808&lt;/b&gt; through a two-step post-synthetic modification. The enol tautomer of 5-FU reconfigures hydrogen-bond networks under humidity variations, synergizing with anchored &#9472;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H groups to establish proton transport pathways along ordered ionic channels (&#9472;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#183;&#183;&#183;5-FU) and tautomerism-driven delocalization via reversible keto-enol isomerization. The optimized compound &lt;b&gt;FU@MOF-808-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a high proton conductivity of 7.15&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 353&#160;K and 95% RH, representing an approximate 300-fold enhancement over pristine &lt;b&gt;MOF-808&lt;/b&gt;, a 15-fold improvement versus the 5-FU-encapsulated analogue &lt;b&gt;FU@MOF-808&lt;/b&gt;, and the sulfonated framework &lt;b&gt;MOF-808-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate an ultra-low formation energy barrier (9.05 and 1.59&#160;kcal&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) from keto to enol conversion, attributed to sulfonic acid stabilization of protonated transition states. Furthermore, the proton conductive mechanism is visually corroborated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, suggesting Grotthuss-dominated proton migration within hydrated nanochannels, aligning with experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adjusting Chemical Hardness&#8211;Softness Balance of Electrolyte to Enable High&#8208;Voltage Reversible Fluoride Ion Batteries</title>

An electrolyte system based on tetrabutylammonium fluoride salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid solvent is designed based on anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base balance modulation. The soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively expanding the electrochemical window and cycling life of fluoride ion batteries based on Cu2O cathode.








Abstract
Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs), as a promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage technology, have attracted significant attention. However, developing an ideal fluoride&#8208;ion electrolyte that suppresses the &#946;&#8208;H abstraction (caused by strong Lewis&#8208;basicity F&#8722;) and electrolyte decomposition remains challenging. To address this bottleneck, we design an electrolyte system based on commercial tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) salt and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF4) ionic liquid solvent through anion&#8211;cation coordination engineering and hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base (HSAB) balance modulation, unveiling its multiscale mechanisms for mitigating interfacial parasitic reaction and enhancing metal anode stability. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the soft&#8208;acid BMIm&#8314; participates in the solvation structure of hard&#8208;base fluoride ions, effectively blocking the &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway and expanding the electrochemical window to 4.5&#160;V. The ionic conductivity of this ionic liquid based electrolyte reaches 5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C even after in situ polymerization. The Cu2O cathode coupling insertion and conversion reactions can alleviate the volume deformation and capacity decay of Cu2O||Li&#8211;LiF high&#8208;voltage FIBs, with a high resting voltage (2.91&#160;V) and a high initial capacity of 589.9&#160;mAh g&#8722;1. The Cu2O||Pb&#8211;PbF2 FIBs maintain a high reversible capacity of 243.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 even after 800 cycles under 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. The work establishes a novel electrolyte design paradigm for high&#8208;voltage reversible FIBs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Mediated Silacyclization by Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Selective C&#9472;F or C&#9472;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;dependent, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes is developed to enable the efficient construction of six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. Selective C&#8211;F functionalization is achieved under 456&#160;nm LED irradiation, while irradiation at 335&#160;nm promotes acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization via C&#8211;H functionalization.








Abstract
Silacycles have gained significant attention within the synthetic community due to their pivotal roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Despite recent advancements, the defluorosilylation of aryl fluorides with hydrosilanes and the selective silylation of arenes without external oxidants remains challenging. Herein, we present a wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;mediated cascade silacyclization of allylbenzene derivatives with dihydrosilanes to efficiently construct six&#8208;membered benzosilacycles. By employing a synergistic system of an organophotocatalyst and a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, our approach exploits specific light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) wavelengths (456 and 335&#160;nm) to achieve selective C&#8211;F and C&#8211;H functionalization. This wavelength modulation enables the first successful defluorosilacyclization of ortho&#8208;fluoroallylbenzenes and facilitates an acceptorless dehydrosilacyclization, demonstrating precise site&#8208;selective functionalization. Mechanistic investigations reveal a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;facilitated intermolecular hydrosilylation followed by a wavelength&#8208;dependent, chemoselective intramolecular silacyclization cascade. Additionally, an unprecedented light&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution process involving silane and thiol is uncovered within the cascade C&#8211;H silacyclization. This photo&#8208;mediated strategy offers a sustainable and versatile platform for the synthesis of valuable silacycle compounds, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and precise wavelength&#8208;dependent chemoselectivity.

The rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex achieves near&#8208;unity PLQY by suppressing nonradiative losses via &#960;&#8208;conjugations. Its flexible scintillator film enables a high&#8208;resolution (&gt;20 lp mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging, a low radiation dose (71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1), and detailed 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction, demonstrating great potential for computed tomography (CT) applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors are essential for 3D X&#8208;ray imaging in computed tomography (CT), but conventional systems require high radiation doses to achieve fine resolution. All&#8208;In&#8208;One (AIO) Cu(I) halide complexes, capable of forming both ionic and coordinate bonds within a single structure, offer efficient scintillation at lower doses, yet their performance remains limited by nonradiative energy losses during indirect X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion. Here, we develop rigid&#8208;cation&#8208;assisted AIO Cu(I) halide complexes by introducing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions to suppress the nonradiative pathways, achieving near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). In particular, the rigid (benzyl&#8208;DABCO)2Cu5I7 (Bz&#8208;Cu5I7) complex stabilizes triplet emissive states, thereby facilitating high&#8208;efficiency radiative recombination and excellent radioluminescence (RL) properties. When incorporated into flexible scintillator film, Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 demonstrates remarkable X&#8208;ray imaging performance, enabling a high spatial resolution exceeding 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and a low radiation dose of 71.2 nGyair s&#8722;1. Importantly, 3D X&#8208;ray image reconstruction of small electronic components reveals fine structural details, highlighting the potential of Bz&#8208;Cu5I7 as a next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray scintillator for low&#8208;dose CT imaging.

         <title>Chemically Stable Tetrazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages with Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification via Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions for SF6/N2 and CO2/N2 Separation</title>

A rigid tetrazine&#8208;based porous organic cage with record SF6 uptake is post&#8208;synthetically tuned via iEDDA chemistry to enhance stability, and further polymerized into networked materials with tunable porosity for selective CO2/N2 separation.








Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) have emerged as promising porous materials for a wide range of applications. However, their development is often limited by insufficient chemical stability and challenges in systematically functionalization. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a tetrazine&#8208;based POC (TC1) featuring rigid tetrahedral structure, prepared via a one&#8208;pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. TC1 exhibits high porosity, with a BET surface area at 1157&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1, and good chemically stability, surpassing most POCs formed through dynamic covalent chemistry. Its well&#8208;defined, electron&#8208;deficient cage cavity enable efficient SF6/N2 separation, showing the highest SF6 adsorption capacity and selectivity among all reported porous molecular materials to data, as confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Post&#8208;synthetic modification of TC1 via inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions yielded two functionalized cages (TC2 and TC3), which maintain good porosity and display further enhanced chemical stability over a broad pH range (&#8208;1 to 15). Furthermore, cage&#8208;based networked materials (TC1&#8208;P1 and TC1&#8208;P2) were successfully constructed through the iEDDA polymerization using TC1 as building unit, resulting in tunable porous frameworks with improved CO2/N2 selectivity.

         <title>Toward Bimetallic Nanowire Arrays with Controlled Compositions Using Block Copolymer Films: The Interplay Between Metal Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;impregnation of block copolymer films enables the creation of ordered arrays of bimetallic nanowires (NWs). The dependence of the NW composition on the feed revealed direct and indirect modes of mutual influence between the metal precursors stemming from the types of interactions involved. The insights gained now enable to design and fabricate arrays of multimetallic nanostructures with both complex morphologies and controlled compositions.








Abstract
Metallic nanowire (NW) arrays are promising components for nanotechnology owing to their elongated, continuous, and directional structure. Bimetallic NWs present synergistic effects that are advantageous for applications in catalysis and magnetism. Yet, creating bimetallic NW arrays requires concomitant control over composition and organization. Block copolymer films, which exhibit periodic arrays of nano&#8208;domains, provide templates that satisfy this requirement. Impregnating the film using two metal precursors followed by plasma treatment enabled us to prepare NW arrays with different bimetallic compositions. The NW composition was found to depend on the composition of the impregnation solution in a nontrivial way, which was strongly influenced by the type of metals used. Studying the behavior of three model metal pairs unraveled different characteristic co&#8208;impregnation behaviors, which we could associate with metal&#8208;ligand and metal&#8208;metal interactions. The insights gained in this study allow us to create bimetallic NW arrays with compositions tailored to the desired properties.

         <title>Crystal Facet&#8208;Engineered Anion Regulation Enables Fast&#8208;Charging Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;engineered ZIF&#8208;8 separators with preferential (110) exposure enable directional Li+ flux by anchoring TFSI&#8722; anions at unsaturated Zn sites, suppressing lithium dendrite growth and stabilizing the interface. The microporous architecture further regulates lithium plating, supporting high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle lithium metal batteries under practical conditions.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) offer exceptional energy density and output voltage. However, their practical application remains hindered by sluggish ion transport and uncontrolled lithium dendrite formation, particularly under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, we report a facet&#8208;engineered anion&#8208;regulating separator based on zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with preferentially crystal&#8208;exposed (110) facets. The coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers on this surface serve as Lewis acid sites that selectively anchor bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions (TFSI&#8722;), inducing directional Li+ flux and suppressing dendritic growth. Concurrently, the microporous framework facilitates spatial lithium confinement, mitigating local current density and enhancing interfacial stability. As a result, the engineered separator enables ultra&#8208;stable cycling of Li||Cu cells for over 1400 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, delivering an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.7%. In full&#8208;cell configurations, LiFePO4 (LFP) cells exhibit 99.9% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles at 5 C, while high&#8208;loading Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811, 12.30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cell retains 84.4% of its capacity after 135 cycles. Furthermore, a Li||LFP pouch cell with a high cathode loading of 19.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 demonstrates robust cycling over 170 cycles. These findings establish facet&#8208;engineered separators based on framework materials as a versatile and scalable strategy for advancing stable and fast&#8208;charging metal batteries.

         <title>Mechanistic Divergence in Sulfur&#8208;Ligated Iron(III)&#8208;Alkylperoxo Reactivity: Aldehyde Oxidation Prevails over Deformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

This study explores the mechanistic investigation into an unusual reactivity of a thioether&#8208;ligated low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;alkylperoxide with cyclohexane&#8211;carboxaldehyde as a mimic of nonheme iron(II) enzyme intermediates and highlights that only efficient catalysis happens from a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species.








Abstract
Metalloenzymes activate molecular oxygen within their catalytic cycles to generate a reactive species capable of substrate transformation. In many iron&#8208;containing enzymes, it is a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex that is synthesized from an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, although direct observation and characterization of such species have remained elusive, leaving their mechanistic role uncertain. To address this gap in our understanding, we present here the synthesis, comprehensive characterization, and reactivity of a novel thioether&#8208;ligated iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo complex supported by the ligand 2&#8208;((2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl)thio)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine. Characterization was done using UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Reactivity studies reveal that this complex exhibits electrophilic oxidation of model substrates, including dimethylsulfide, triphenylphosphine, and cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde. Notably, the latter substrate reacts via the unusual aldehyde C&#9472;H bond abstraction leading to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, which is explained by favorable aldehyde C&#9472;H abstraction transition states due to stabilizing interactions between the ligand framework and the substrate. Moreover, the reaction is initiated with a homolytic O&#9472;O bond cleavage in the iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo group that yields a reactive iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species that mediates substrate oxidation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a mononuclear low&#8208;spin (S = &#189;) nonheme iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo complex displaying such unprecedented electrophilic reactivity.

         <title>Regiodivergent Ligand&#8208;Controlled Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydroxymethylation of Alkynes with Aqueous Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent water&#8208;tolerant reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has been developed via synergistic visible light organophotoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. The reaction produced valuable linear and branched allylic alcohols with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by choosing of suitable ligand under otherwise the same reaction conditions.








Abstract
Allylic alcohols are versatile and essential building blocks in synthetic chemistry, widely used for the preparation of complex molecules, pharmaceuticals, and materials. We report here a regiodivergent reductive hydroxymethylation of terminal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde to prepare allylic alcohols enabled by visible light photoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. Using readily available, bulk, and cheap aqueous formaldehyde as a simple C1 source, this method allows for the selective production of both linear and branched allylic alcohols in one&#8208;step manner. The excellent regioselectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled by adjusting the electronic and steric properties of the ligands. Moreover, regioselective reductive hydroxymethylation of internal alkynes with aqueous formaldehyde has also been achieved by careful selection of ligands. Mechanistic studies reveal a pathway involving ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and formaldehyde, followed by a protonolysis process, offering new insights into the catalyst design and reaction mechanism.

         <title>Sustained, Reversible, and Adaptive Non&#8208;Equilibrium Steady States of a Dissipative DNA&#8208;Based System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous supply of an RNA chemical fuel allows sustained non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction to be achieved. The system can dynamically adapt in real&#8208;time to subtle on&#8208;the&#8208;fly variations of fuel supply, demonstrating remarkable control over a dissipative process, which is unachievable when using batch&#8208;wise fuel additions. We confirmed the non&#8208;equilibrium composition of the system at the NESS.








Abstract
Inspired by nature, researchers have developed several chemical fuel&#8208;driven supramolecular systems aimed at achieving improved kinetic control over their formation and functions. Alongside, DNA&#8208;based systems regulated by energy&#8208;dissipating mechanisms have been reported. However, the majority of these systems rely on batchwise additions of chemical fuels to closed reactors, resulting in transient non&#8208;equilibrium states that differ fundamentally from the sustained and highly adaptable non&#8208;equilibrium steady states (NESS) maintained by living systems through continuous energy dissipation. Here, we demonstrate sustained NESS of a dissipative DNA strand&#8208;displacement reaction achieved through the continuous supply of an RNA fuel to an open semi&#8208;batch reactor, using a custom automated setup that enables tunable fuel infusion rates and in situ analysis. Similar to biological NESS, our system dynamically adapts in real&#8208;time to subtle variations in fuel supply, achieving different steady&#8208;state levels of the strand&#8208;displacement reaction. Our approach demonstrates remarkable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly control over a dissipative DNA nanosystem, unachievable when working under batch conditions. Importantly, by fitting the experimental data to a kinetic model of the reaction network, we were able to confirm that the observed steady states correspond to true non&#8208;equilibrium compositions of the system.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Metal Interaction in Cu&#8208;In Single Atom Alloy Switching Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;In single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, Cu99In1 and Cu1In99, were constructed by reversing the host and guest metals, resulting in a switch in the CO2 electroreduction reaction pathway from favoring CO to HCOOH. In both SAA catalysts, Cu serves as the active site, with its adsorption energy modulated by surrounding Indium atoms, enabling high selectivity for a single product.








Abstract
The catalytic behavior of alloy electrocatalyst is strongly influenced by host&#8211;guest metal interaction, which governs adsorption energy and product selectivity. However, in conventional bimetallic alloy systems, the catalyst composition and the geometric configuration often obscure the identification of critical active sites. Here, we investigate the host&#8211;guest metal interaction in Cu&#8211;In single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, demonstrating a remarkable switching of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) pathway. Doping 1% Indium into a Cu matrix forms isolated In&#8208;Cu interfaces, enabling efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90%. Conversely, doping 1% Cu into an Indium matrix leads to the formation of a CuIn alloy phase, shifting the product selectivity to HCOOH with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90%. In situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that Cu serves as the active site on both Cu&#8211;In SAA catalysts. The adsorption energy of host Cu atoms is affected by doped Indium at the In&#8208;Cu interface, which promotes CO2 adsorption and activation while weakening the binding strength of linearly bonded *CO, thereby enhancing CO selectivity. Conversely, the rigid matrix of the CuIn alloy stabilizes the bridge&#8208;bonded *CO, favoring the production of HCOOH.

         <title>A Universal Voltage&#8208;Enhancement Strategy Based on Multifunctional Ligand&#8208;Mediated Modulation for Na&#8208;Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ antibonding orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3&#8314;/Mn&#8308;&#8314; redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as promising energy storage solutions due to resource abundance and low cost, yet their practical deployment is hindered by limited operating voltages of cathode materials. Herein, we propose a universal ligand&#8208;field engineering strategy to enhance voltage through electronic structure modulation in transition metal oxides. Using the Na0.67Mg0.2Mn0.8O2 as a model system, weak&#8208;field ligands are introduced to alter the coordination environment of MnO6 octahedra. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the weak&#8208;field ligands reduce Mn octahedral splitting energy, inducing a downshift of the eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital. This shifts the valence band maximum away from the vacuum level, thereby elevating the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox potential with an average voltage increase of 0.24&#160;V. Concurrently, the lowered initial Mn oxidation state induces an increased discharge capacity by 35.7% (153.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), while suppressing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions and Mn3+ disproportionation yielding 94.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles (versus 69.9% in pristine sample). This ligand&#8208;engineering strategy in regulating redox voltage can be extended to other systems with eg&#8727;$e_g^*$&#8208;involved redox systems (such as Ni&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and Mn&#8208;based cathodes). Our work establishes a direct correlation between eg&#8727;$e_g^*$ orbital energy modulation and operating voltage, providing foundational insights for designing Na&#8208;layered oxide cathodes with high operating voltage.

Abstract
Designing unique electrocatalysts that utilizes carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) for real applications is highly appreciated, yet still suffers from low selectivity, stability, and compatibility. Herein, we first report a new two&#8208;dimensional metastable&#8208;phase transparent conducting oxide: 1T phase indium tin oxide (m&#8208;ITOs) with the space group of P&#8722;3m1 (164), which is totally different from that of the stable cubic phase ITO (Ia&#8722;3 (206)). The internal indium tin catalytic pairs in m&#8208;ITOs trigger the strong electronic coupling, move up the p&#8208;band center, and stabilize the adsorption of HCOO* for increased formate production. In a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit a high CO2RR electrocatalytic performance with the formate selectivity up to 93&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% (83&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6% for In2O3/SnO2) and remains 97% (58% for c&#8208;SnInOx and 60% for In2O3/SnO2) of catalytic activity after a 120,000&#160;s stability test. Owing to the efficient formate formation with directly using the absorbed CO2 in water and high transparent property, m&#8208;ITOs exhibit excellent antifouling behavior of inhibiting Chlorella growth without reducing the transparency of itself, encouraging a promising application of observation windows in water.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Assay System to Quantify O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) Activity in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded, imaging&#8208;based reporter enables direct measurement of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) activity in living cells. The system exploits OGT&#8208;dependent proteolysis of HCF&#8208;1 to drive nuclear and cytoplasmic redistribution of fluorescent signals, allowing cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell spatially resolved quantification of OGT activity. This OGT&#8208;CAR platform offers a powerful tool for studying OGT regulation and discovering cellular modulators.








Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes O&#8208;GlcNAcylation of many nucleocytoplasmic proteins and plays important roles in regulating diverse cellular functions. Dysregulation of OGT is implicated in various diseases, including cancers and neurodegeneration. Despite its vital roles, little is known about how this enzyme is regulated within cells in part because no current assays directly report on its activity within cells. Here we describe a genetically encoded reporter of cellular OGT glycosyltransferase activity by exploiting the transferase&#8208;dependent proteolytic activity of OGT on host cell factor&#8208;1 (HCF&#8208;1). The reporter comprises sites at which OGT cleaves HCF&#8208;1, which are flanked by two different fluorescent proteins that are linked to either nuclear export or import sequences. OGT&#8208;catalyzed cleavage of this construct leads to separation and independent localization of these two fluorescent proteins. By quantifying their nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions, OGT activity can be measured. We validated this OGT cellular activity reporter (CAR) system using known modulators of the O&#8208;GlcNAc pathway and assessed the effects of several metabolites on OGT activity. Analyses of the dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent effects of these OGT modulators illustrate the sensitivity and precision of this OGT&#8208;CAR strategy. We envision this OGT&#8208;CAR system will aid in discovering and characterizing modifiers of OGT activity.

         <title>Enhancement of Emission Efficiency and Color Tuning by Mixing Platinum(II) and Palladium(II) Complexes in a One&#8208;dimensional Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mixing isomorphous Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes, which have very low emission efficiencies at room temperature, in pure crystals, a series of mixed crystals with high emission efficiencies and luminescent colors depending on the mixing ratio were successfully constructed. The characteristic luminescence of the mixed crystals originates from excited oligomers with different Pt/Pd ratios.








Abstract
A series of mixed metal crystals comprising square&#8208;planar platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes, K[M(CN)2(dFppy)]&#183;H2O (M&#160;=&#160;Pt2+, Pd2+; dFppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;(4,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridinate), were prepared, and their unique luminescence properties&#8212;emerging upon mixing&#8212;were revealed. Seven mixed crystals with Pt/Pd ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:4.5, 1:10, and 1:13 adopt the same crystal structure (P21/c) as the pure metal complexes, in which the metal complexes are stacked with short M&#8943;M contacts (3.35&#8211;3.37&#160;&#197; at 293&#160;K). Reflecting the M&#8943;M interactions, the mixed crystals exhibited luminescence attributable to the emission from the triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) state. The emission color varied with the Pt/Pd mixing ratio, and notably, a significant enhancement in emission quantum yield was observed (e.g., &#934;&#160;=&#160;0.64 for the Pt/Pd&#160;=&#160;1:2 crystal at room temperature). The emission efficiency further improved at temperatures above room temperature. These unprecedented emission properties are explained by energy transfer among multiple emission sites within the one&#8208;dimensional chain, involving excited oligomers containing various combinations of Pt and Pd complexes. Thus, metal mixing offers a new strategy for enhancing emission efficiency and enabling color tuning.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable and Tunable Polyolefin&#8208;Like Multiblock Copolymer Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like multiblock copolymer adhesives with tunable cohesion and adhesion. By controlling crystallinity, ester content, and block structure, these materials achieve up to &#8764;80% stronger adhesion than EVA, while enabling depolymerization, reuse, and multilayer deconstruction&#8212;offering a sustainable and high&#8208;performance HMA platform.








Abstract
Adhesives are important in creating multilayer products, such as in packaging and construction. Most current hot&#8208;melt adhesives such as poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;vinyl acetate) (EVA) and polyurethanes lack chemical recyclability and do not easily de&#8208;bond, complicating recycling. Here, we achieved tunable adhesive properties of chemically recyclable polyolefin&#8208;like multiblock copolymers through regulating the incorporation of crystalline hard blocks, amorphous soft blocks, and ester content highlighted by adhesive strengths up to 6.80&#160;MPa. We further demonstrated applications of these adhesives in multi&#8208;layer films and showed that the adhesives can be readily de&#8208;bonded, recovered, and chemically recycled. Overall, this study into structure&#8211;property relationships, including effects of crystallinity, soft&#8208;block incorporation, and ester content of the multiblock copolymers on adhesive properties, has resulted in a modular hot&#8208;melt adhesive platform that exhibits chemical recyclability for virgin&#8208;quality adhesive re&#8208;generation, reprocessability for repeated reuse of the recovered adhesive, and tunability for designing adhesives with a wide range of low to high (up to &#8764;80% stronger than EVA) adhesion strengths.

         <title>Fluorine Modified Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Enables Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries by Suppression of Polyiodide Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexapod&#8208;shaped fluorine&#8208;modified zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) particles are synthesized as a functional layer on the glass fiber separator to suppress polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries have emerged as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high specific capacity. However, their commercial implementation is severely hindered by the irreversible capacity degradation and limited cycle life, which are caused by the unavoidable iodine shuttle effect resulting from the formation of soluble I3&#8722; species. Herein, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional hexapod&#8208;like fluorine&#8208;containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (H&#8208;F&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles for separator modification to effectively inhibit the iodine shuttle effect. The modified layer can interact with the I3&#8722; species at the cathode&#8211;separator interface where the iodine shuttle occurs. Furthermore, the fluorine&#8208;containing functional group (&#9472;CF3) serves as an electron acceptor, enhancing the electrostatic interaction with I3&#8722; species, and thereby improving the polyiodide capture capacity. As a result, the Zn&#8211;I2 battery using H&#8208;F&#8208;ZIF modified separator exhibits excellent cycling durability and high capacity, retaining a capacity of 155.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 12&#160;000 cycles at 1.2&#160;A g&#8722;1, and a coulombic efficiency of 86.4% after 48&#160;h of resting.

         <title>Engineering Covalent and Noncovalent Interface Synergy in MXenes for Ultralong&#8208;life and Efficient Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the ANF&#8208;mediated thermal reconstruction, we achieved the deep modification of MXene with synergistic noncovalent/covalent interaction toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off between the reactivity and stability for energetic pseudocapacitive storage chemistry. The unique synergistic interface effects trigger a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180, 000 cycles.








Abstract
MXenes serve as pivotal candidates for pseudocapacitive energy storage owing to sound proton/electron&#8208;transport capability and tunable topology. However, the metastable surface terminal properties and the progressive oxidation leads to drastic capacity fading, posing significant challenges for sustainable energy applications. Here, with the aramid nanofiber as the interface mediator, we engineer the thermal reconstruction of MXenes to synergistically introduce interfacial covalent and noncovalent interactions, resulting in a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180,&#160;000 cycles. In&#8208;situ heating transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrate the formation of ultrafine mesopores with interfacial reconstitution for mass transport intensification. Theoretical calculations indicate electronic accumulation adjacent to the covalent bonds, endowing the heterogeneous interface with fast electronic conduction capability and favorable adsorption of H+. In addition, the dual modification improves the oxidation energy barrier of MXenes to TiO2, resulting in a thermodynamically promoted and sustainable storage microenvironment. Our research emphasizes the synergistic mechanism of noncovalent interactions and covalent bonding toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off of MXenes between the reactivity and stability for energetic energy storage.

         <title>CO2 Versus CH4 Aggregation on Trifluorobenzene: Molecular Level Characterization via Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
What makes aromatic ligands selective for CO2 over CH4? Broadband rotational spectroscopy reveals how 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene forms stronger F&#8943;C tetrel and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with CO2, versus weaker CH&#8943;F hydrogen bonds with CH4, along with intriguing tunneling motions. These molecular&#8208;level insights could benefit the design of ligands for selective gas adsorption in MOFs and related materials.








Abstract
The cluster growth behavior of CO2 and CH4 on an aromatic ligand has been studied through the unambiguous identification of complex structures of 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene&#8208;(CO2)1&#8211;4 and &#8208;&#223;(CH4)1&#8211;2 using broadband rotational spectroscopy in conjunction with extensive theoretical calculations. The results reveal a contrast in the thermodynamically favorable ligand&#8208;gas binding sites and noncovalent interactions of the two gaseous molecules on the ligand. The observation of a tunneling splitting and large centrifugal distortions indicates that CH4 molecules bind to the fluorinated &#960; system via three weak hydrogen bonds without CH4 self&#8208;interactions, resulting in an effective structure displaced toward the dissociation limit. Conversely, CO2 shows diverse and stronger intermolecular interactions with the fluorinated benzene, including F&#9472;C tetrel bonding, lone pair to &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and a significant contribution from CO2 self&#8208;interactions. The thorough examination of ligand&#8211;gas interactions and aggregation patterns highlights the significant capacity and selectivity of the fluorinated aromatic ligand for accepting CO2 over CH4.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the Ru 4d and the C&#8801;N 2p induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and further modulates the d&#8208;electron structure of V/Fe, enabling the cooperative V3+/V4+, Ru(2x&#8208;&#948;)+/Ru2x+, and Fe2+/Fe3+ multi&#8208;redox reactions.








Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage offers grid&#8208;scale energy storage system with long lifespan, great safety, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, preparing proton storage materials with balanced conductivity, activity, and stability remains challenging due to suboptimal structure design. Herein, we report atomic&#8208;level engineering of d&#8208;p orbital hybridization strategy to regulate transition metal (V/Fe) d&#8208;band centers. Vanadium hexacyanoferrate (VHCF)/RuOx quantum dots (RuOxQDs) heterostructure (VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs) was synthesized via in situ co&#8208;precipitation. The d&#8208;p hybridization of Ru's 4d orbital with VHCF's C&#8801;N 2p orbital (cyano) induces &#960;&#8208;backdonation and creates &#8220;electronic highways&#8221; for regulating the d&#8208;electrons of V/Fe, shifting their d&#8208;band centers to achieve continuous multi&#8208;electron transfer. Moreover, optimizing the d&#8208;electron structure reduces the V5+ ratio and thus decreases vanadium dissolution during cycling. The VHCF&#8211;RuOxQDs cathode delivers a large capacity of 162&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability (127&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 40&#160;A g&#8722;1), and ultralong stability over 10&#160;000 cycles. When paired with MoO3&#8211;MXene anode, the asymmetric full device achieves a high energy density of 53&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1.3&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. The atomic&#8208;level orbital hybridization regulation of d&#8208;electron structure provides a new direction for high&#8208;performance proton storage.

A light&#8208;induced transfection system (LITS) was designed to precisely control the delivery of mRNA, achieving spatiotemporal de&#8208;coupling of the pleotropic inflammatory and tolerogenic signals of interleukin&#8208;2 to conduct safe eradication of tumors.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of protein expression remains a critical challenge in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics, particularly for tumor&#8208;targeted therapy. Here, we introduce a Light&#8208;Induced Transfection System (LITS) leveraging photosensitizing polymers to deliver mRNA systemically and activate its translation via light&#8208;triggered endosomal escape. This system enables localized protein expression in any irradiated tissue, allowing for spatial control of therapeutic effects. Using interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) as a model, we demonstrate that LITS can trigger proinflammatory cytokine levels in irradiated tumors, while inducing tolerogenic IL&#8208;2 levels in nonirradiated healthy tissues. This modulation of IL&#8208;2&#8242;s pleiotropic effects provides both potent antitumor activity and reduced toxicity. Furthermore, by optimizing light exposure, LITS synergizes IL&#8208;2 efficacy by driving immunogenic cell death to eradicate lung metastasis in a breast cancer model. Our findings establish LITS as a programmable mRNA delivery platform for on&#8208;demand targeted and safe therapies.

         <title>Discrete Actuation of Water&#8208;Responsive Crystalline Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design metal&#8211;peptide frameworks that exhibit either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;responsive actuation by tuning water&#8208;binding affinities and structural dynamics. In the continuous actuation mode, water molecules evaporate sequentially due to varying interaction strengths and structural roles. Conversely, when water molecules display comparable interactions and roles, they release simultaneously during dehydration, producing discrete threshold actuation.








Abstract
Engineering guest&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled and precise sorption behavior and structural deformation in response to external stimuli is imperative for various applications. However, existing systems often exhibit complex, unpredictable dynamics, posing challenges for efficient control and utilization. Here, we design crystalline metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with tunable water&#8208;responsive (WR) dynamics by assembling glycine&#8208;threonine (Gly&#8208;Thr, GT) or glycine&#8208;serine (Gly&#8208;Ser, GS) peptides with zinc (Zn) ions, achieving either continuous or discrete threshold water&#8208;sorption&#8208;dependent phase transitions. As ambient relative humidity (RH) changes, the Zn&#8208;GT crystal continuously adsorbs or desorbs water, resulting in gradual structural adaptations, similar to those observed in other supramolecular systems. In contrast, the Zn&#8208;GS crystal undergoes stepwise water sorption and structural transitions at specific RH thresholds. These contrasting WR modes arise from differences in water binding and structural dynamics; in Zn&#8208;GT, each coordinating water molecule contributes varying degrees of framework integrity and evaporates sequentially, whereas in Zn&#8208;GS, water molecules with comparable interactions within a flexible framework are released simultaneously during dehydration. Our study demonstrates the mechanism by which host&#8211;guest interactions can be harnessed to control dynamic sorption and actuation behavior of supramolecular materials at the molecular level, offering mechanistic insights that may guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation programmable, stimulus&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>Orthogonal Control of Lattice Oxygen Activation and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Suppression via &#8220;Molecular Gates&#8221; for High&#8208;Efficiency Nitrile Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the principle of biological compartmentalization, Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), a dual&#8208;group molecule with phosphine oxide and alkylamine groups, is introduced as &#8220;molecular gates&#8221; to achieve orthogonal control over lattice oxygen activation and oxygen evolution reaction suppression, and the high&#8208;current nitrile electrosynthesis with unprecedented efficiency and stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
A fundamental barrier to industrial electrosynthesis is the inescapable trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity at high current densities, where parasitic reactions overwhelm the desired interfacial chemistry. Here, we introduce a bioinspired interfacial decoupling strategy using hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) to resolve this challenge for nitrile electrosysthesis. The activation of lattice oxygen for substrate dehydrogenation via metal&#8208;ligand charge redistribution, and the suppression of OH&#8722;&#8208;driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via electrostatic shielding by hydrophobic alkyl chains are concurrently controlled. As a result, we achieved simultaneously high activity (1.37&#160;V @300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), near&#8208;unity selectivity (93.3% Faradaic efficiency (FE)), and pharmaceutical&#8208;grade purity for propionitrile production. Further reinforced by exceptional stability (&gt;300&#160;h at industrially relevant current densities), a record production rate (143.86&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1), and &#8764;30% energy reduction, the system significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. Furthermore, this electrolyte&#8208;catalyst co&#8208;optimization strategy proves universal across primary/secondary amines, offering a blueprint for sustainable chemical manufacturing beyond fossil&#8208;fueled processes.

         <title>A Transient Phenolate Enables Relaxation of Z&#8208;Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene to the Stable State in Seconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of a tetrafluoroazobenzene subunit in a spiropyran hybrid is controlled by the rate of merocyanine formation. Rate accelerations of 102&#8211;106 were observed for changes in solvent polarity, UV light irradiation and passage through silica. Rapid azobenzene isomerization occurs via a transient phenolate formed upon spiropyran ring&#8208;opening.








Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzenes (TFAs) exhibit several unique properties, including a large separation in the n&#8594;&#960;* absorption bands, which allows for efficient photoisomerization using green light, and exceptional thermal stability of their metastable Z&#8208;isomer. These features make them attractive for light&#8208;responsive applications, but controlling the thermal Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization has remained a challenge. In this work, we present a hybrid molecular system that couples a TFA subunit with a spiropyran photoswitch. The TFA subunit retains its ability to undergo selective photoisomerization with green light. Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization in the hybrid occurs approximately 1000 times faster than in a TFA model compound. This acceleration arises from a rate&#8208;determining step involving the formation of merocyanine&#8212;the ring&#8208;opened form of spiropyran. The transient phenolate form of merocyanine promotes rapid Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization of the TFA, consistent with the known behavior of azobenzene phenolates. The thermodynamics of TFA isomerization are coupled with those of the spiropyran ring&#8208;opening, allowing the isomerization process to be regulated by external stimuli that influence the spiropyran&#8211;merocyanine equilibrium. In addition to observing a 100&#8211;1000&#8208;fold solvent&#8208;dependent rate increase, we demonstrate a 106&#8208;fold acceleration in TFA isomerization via either photochromism or adsorptiochromism.

         <title>Origin and Suppression of Intragranular Cracks for Long&#8208;Cycling High&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;Free Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are found to be widely distributed in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free (NM) cathodes, and the relation between APBs gain boundaries and intragranular cracks has been established for the first time. Additionally, a charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy is proposed to reduce the formation of APBs and optimize the generation/distribution of internal stresses, thereby suppressing intragranular cracks. 








Abstract
Intragranular cracks have been identified as a direct reflection of failure in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes, especially for high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes with severe electrochemical&#8211;mechanical degradation. Here we show that antiphase boundaries (APBs) are prone to form in high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes and demonstrate their crucial role in determining the formation of intragranular cracks. The results show that the APBs grain boundaries are continuously expand during the electrochemical process, and their presence promotes the formation and accumulation of heterogeneous internal stresses within the layered structure, which in turn facilitates the nucleation and expansion of intragranular cracks. We further show that an elaborate charge self&#8208;balancing doping strategy can inhibit APBs, which not only maintains the electronic equilibrium of the oxygen framework, but also the synergistic effect of double&#8208;site modification can exhibit a &#8220;lattice&#8208;locking&#8221; effect, leading to an ordered layered structure. The present work suppresses intragranular cracks by eliminating APBs grain boundaries, and this understanding provides insights for developing long&#8208;cycling high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free cathodes.

     alt="Origin and Suppression of Intragranular Cracks for Long-Cycling High-Ni Co-Free Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiphase boundaries (APBs) are found to be widely distributed in high-Ni Co-free (NM) cathodes, and the relation between APBs gain boundaries and intragranular cracks has been established for the first time. Additionally, a charge self-balancing doping strategy is proposed to reduce the formation of APBs and optimize the generation/distribution of internal stresses, thereby suppressing intragranular cracks.

         <title>Selectively Modulating the Donor and Acceptor Aggregation Behaviors Through Solid Additive Isomerization Engineering for Organic Solar Cells Exceeding 20% Efficiency</title>

Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation in organic solar cells. Systematic analysis demonstrates that the isomerization of solid additives can selectively modulate the aggregation behavior of donor and acceptor materials. Consequently, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far.








Abstract
Regulating the film morphology is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Given the distinct features of donor and acceptor materials, designing solid additives to selectively control the aggregation behaviors of them represents a key strategy for further development of OSCs. Herein, a series of bithiophene isomers solid additives (2,2&#8208;TT, 2,3&#8208;TT, and 3,3&#8208;TT) are designed for film morphology regulation. Systematic analysis reveals that the addition of 2,2&#8208;TT significantly enhances the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of L8&#8208;BO, yet exerts a relatively limited effect on PM6 aggregation. Conversely, the incorporation of 3,3&#8208;TT not only facilitates the formation of compact and highly ordered molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO but also substantially promote the denser &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of PM6. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs with 3,3&#8208;TT treatment achieve a higher efficiency of 19.34%, benefitting from the balanced charge mobility and longer carrier lifetime. More impressively, the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices treated with 3,3&#8208;TT deliver a remarkable efficiency of 20.32%, with an excellent fill factor of 82.47%, which ranks among the best values reported so far. This work highlights the critical role of the solid additive isomerization strategy in selectively regulating the aggregation characteristics of donor and acceptor materials, thereby facilitating the further advancement of OSCs field.

         <title>In Situ Exfoliation of Covalent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three silver cyclic trinuclear units (Ag&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) are prepared and they can serve as efficient photocatalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen. Notably, as the reaction proceeded, in situ exfoliation of these CMOFs into ultrathin nanosheets remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic performance for H2O2 production.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets exhibit largely enhanced photocatalytic activities for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Conventionally, the nanosheets are fabricated through ex situ approaches (i.e., top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up) prior to catalytic applications. However, the preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets via in situ exfoliation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of three 2D silver cyclic trinuclear unit (Ag&#8208;CTU)&#8208;based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs). Owing to their excellent light adsorption ability and suitable bandgap, these CMOFs can serve as efficient photocatalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen. Notably, the H2O2 production rates of these CMOFs were increased continuously during the photocatalytic processes, reaching 0.50, 1.40, 2.88, and 3.60&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 after 6, 18, 36, and 72&#160;h, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that in situ exfoliation of these CMOFs into ultrathin nanosheets (&#8764;0.87&#160;nm) significantly enhances their photocatalytic activity. Moreover, these CMOFs achieve a remarkable H2O2 accumulation of 609&#160;mM over 72 h, to best of our knowledge, which surpasses the most previously reported values.

         <title>Oxidative Addition of Aryl Bromides at Palladium(I) to form Palladium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals a detailed mechanistic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a Pd(I) center to generate an isolable Pd(III) species. UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow kinetic studies, including Eyring and Hammett analyses, reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a Pd(I) center, and a zero&#8208;order dependence on the substrate.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first systematic study of the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to a PdI center to generate organometallic PdIII complexes. These isolable PdIII complexes stabilized by tetradentate macrocyclic pyridinophane ligands exhibit distinct UV&#8211;vis and EPR spectroscopic signatures that allowed for the monitoring of their generation in situ. These ligand scaffolds were sterically and electronically tuned using a modular synthetic approach to probe the kinetic properties and activation parameters of the oxidative addition reaction, and a combination of UV&#8211;vis and cryo stopped&#8208;flow spectroscopic studies reveal a rapid oxidative addition step occurring at a PdI center. In addition, these results are in strong agreement with our recent reactivity studies, which demonstrated that mononuclear PdI systems are competent catalysts in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and thus set the stage for an improved understanding of potential catalytic applications for odd&#8208;electron Pd systems.

         <title>Multifunctional Binding Interface Drives Near&#8208;Unity CO Selectivity in Acidic CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of redox&#8208;active isoindigo molecule on Ag catalyst promotes CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to CO in acid. Collective impacts are revealed by combining theoretical, in situ spectroscopic and catalytic analyses. Lewis acid&#8208;base complexation is the dominant contributor with the assistance of intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond and interfacial water network effects, augmenting stabilization and activation of CO2&#8208;bound intermediates.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is challenged by the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) especially in acidic media. Here, we elaborate that redox&#8208;active isoindigo, acting as a multifunctional co&#8208;catalyst, can pre&#8208;activate CO2&#8208;bound intermediates and suppress HER upon the synergistic effects of Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct formation, intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, and interfacial water structure modulation. Modifying a silver catalyst with isoindigo substantially decreases the energy barrier for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*COOH conversion, which is regarded as the potential&#8208;limiting step of carbon monoxide production. Accordingly, superior catalytic performances are obtained at pH 2, where Faradaic efficiencies surpass 99% at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Moreover, we find that assembling an additional polyamine&#8208;coated layer in front of gas flow channels improves CO2 transport to the catalyst layer, optimizing the trade&#8208;off of conversion and selectivity at low flow rates.

&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction is challenged by the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) especially in acidic media. Here, we elaborate that redox-active isoindigo, acting as a multifunctional co-catalyst, can pre-activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bound intermediates and suppress HER upon the synergistic effects of Lewis acid-base adduct formation, intramolecular hydrogen-bond interaction, and interfacial water structure modulation. Modifying a silver catalyst with isoindigo substantially decreases the energy barrier for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-*COOH conversion, which is regarded as the potential-limiting step of carbon monoxide production. Accordingly, superior catalytic performances are obtained at pH 2, where Faradaic efficiencies surpass 99% at industrial-relevant current densities. Moreover, we find that assembling an additional polyamine-coated layer in front of gas flow channels improves CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport to the catalyst layer, optimizing the trade-off of conversion and selectivity at low flow rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustained Release of Underpotential Deposition Initiators for Ah&#8208;Level Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale nickel complex nanofilm sustainably releases nickel ions, precisely controlling zinc deposition to overcome electrolyte&#8208;additive depletion in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With hydrophobic protection and dynamic underpotential deposition initiation, it delivers 30&#160;000 stable cycles, practical Ah&#8208;level pouch cells (1.5&#160;Ah) with high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), and efficient photovoltaically re&#8208;charged performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives effectively stabilize aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet their depletion during long&#8208;term cycling leads to eventual battery failure. Here, we address this common issue through sustained release of underpotential deposition initiators from an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve the long&#8208;term operation. This SEI, comprising nickel hydroxide and nickel&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazole complexes embedded in a hydrophobic dodecylphosphonic acid (DPA) monolayer via ion&#8208;layer epitaxy, releases Ni2+ ions on&#8208;demand when local pH rises due to corrosion. In this way, the protection through sustained and controlled release of underpotential deposition initiator over long&#8208;term operation is achieved. Concurrently, the hydrophobic DPA layer restricts direct water contact, effectively suppressing side reactions. Consequently, the engineered Ni@DPA&#8208;coated Zn electrode demonstrates remarkable stability, enduring over 37&#160;500 cycles at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full cells retain exceptional cycling performance for over 30&#160;000 cycles at 45&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, achieving an unprecedented energy density of 270&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (1.5&#160;Ah) delivers a high areal capacity (13.8&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), maintaining 83% capacity after 400 cycles. Demonstrating practical application, a Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell can be directly charged by an external solar panel with photovoltaic conversion efficiencies up to 10.8%. This approach significantly advances AZIBs toward practical, high&#8208;performance energy storage.

         <title>Dihydroxanthene&#8208;Derived Dioxetane Chemiluminophores for Activatable in Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived dioxetane chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) is developed through rational design, structural optimization, and acceptor engineering. DhX&#8208;CLs feature a novel modular core structure, tunable chemiluminescence wavelengths, high quantum yields, long near&#8208;infrared emission, biocompatibility, activatable capability, and in vivo imaging applicability.








Abstract
Chemiluminophores with optimal chemiluminescence properties and versatile structures adaptable into activatable chemiluminescent probes are of particular interest for biosensing and imaging owing to their high sensitivity and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. However, such chemiluminophores are still limited. Herein, we report dihydroxanthene&#8208;derived chemiluminophores (DhX&#8208;CLs) that integrate an adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane moiety with a rationally designed dihydroxanthene&#8208;like core skeleton featuring an extended and restricted &#960;&#8208;electron system. Structural optimization of the dihydroxanthene&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;based prototype chemiluminophore generated a bright yellow chemiluminophore DhX&#8208;CL4 with a quantum yield of 35.4% under aqueous conditions, higher than those of existing dioxetanes in the green&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range beyond 500&#160;nm. Further &#960;&#8208;electron extension and acceptor engineering resulted in NIR chemiluminophores with high brightness and biocompatibility. Notably, DhX&#8208;CL7 exhibits long&#8208;lasting chemiluminescence with a maximum NIR emission at 808&#160;nm and a quantum yield 3.17%, higher than those of most reported NIR chemiluminophores. We further demonstrated that caging of these chemiluminophores with analyte&#8208;responsive moieties afforded activatable chemiluminescent probes for in vivo imaging of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and peroxynitrite. Overall, this new family of chemiluminophores, with tunable emission wavelengths and remarkable chemiluminescence properties, serves as a versatile platform for in vivo chemiluminescence imaging.

         <title>A Water Soluble and Solid&#8208;State Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) System as Renewable Solar Fuel</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;A new series of highly water soluble norbornadienes has been synthesized and characterized as molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems in gram scale. Particularly, concentrated solutions (1&#160;M) and solid&#8208;state heat release showed a thermal heat release of 7.5&#160;and 39.6&#160;K, respectively, with full reversibility in both cases. These systems represent a new avenue for transferring the MOST technology to real and sustainable applications.&#8221;








Abstract
Solar energy storage is key to overcome the intermittent character of sunlight. We present a sustainable solution based on norbornadiene&#8211;quadricyclane pairs for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage working in highly concentrated neutral water solutions and solid state. Photochemical preparation of high&#8208;energy, metastable isomers in previously unattainable 1.64&#160;M solutions was achieved. The best compound can be stored for 1.9 years and is stable in solid state, allowing for the preparation of up to 3&#160;M water solutions. Catalyzed back&#8208;conversion ensures efficient heat release and starting material recovery with remarkable fatigue resistance in water solution and solid state, exhibiting macroscopic heat release in both states, providing a &#916;T of 39.6&#160;K and fully recyclable use. These results highlight a promising avenue for the practical application of MOST technology.

         <title>Competitive Chirality Induction in Two&#8208;dimensional Germanium Iodide Perovskites Enabling Highly Anisotropic Nonlinear Optical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two sets of chiral germanium iodide perovskites (R/S&#8208;BGI and P/M&#8208;BGI) were synthesized through two distinct chiral introduction mechanisms, providing new ideas for the synthesis of chiral metal halides. R&#8208;BGI and P&#8208;BGI exhibit remarkable chiral nonlinear optical properties with extremely high gSHG&#8208;CD of up to 0.71 and 0.83 and high laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the values of most previously reported chiral perovskites.








Abstract
Chiral metal halide perovskites (CMHPs) are a promising class of chiroptical materials with significant potential applications in chiral&#8208;optoelectronic and chiral&#8208;spintronic devices. However, their chirality induction generally stems from the incorporation of chiral ligands, which constitutes compositional diversity and functional versatility. Herein, we report a significant chiral expression resulting from two distinct mechanisms: chirality transfer induced by chiral organic cations and mirror symmetry breaking driven by stereochemically active lone pairs, both contributing to controlled chirality induction. Homochiral germanium iodide perovskites, (R/S&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 (R/S is Rectus/Sinister) can be achieved by employing chiral (R/S)&#8208;BrMBA cations to induce chirality via hydrogen bonding. In contrast, two enantiomorphous helical germanium iodide perovskites, P/M&#8208;(rac&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 (P/M is Plus/Minus&#160;and rac is racemic), are formed via the co&#8208;assembly of racemic rac&#8208;BrMBA cations and germanium iodide networks, where chirality arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the stereochemically active 4s2 electron pair. Remarkably, benefiting from the inherent chirality, both (R&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 and P&#8208;(rac&#8208;BrMBA)2GeI4 crystals exhibit exceptional anisotropic nonlinear optical properties with large anisotropy factors (gSHG&#8208;CD) up to 0.71 and 0.83 and laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most previously reported CMHPs. This study provides insight into the interplay of chiral organic ligands and inorganic ions in the chiral induction, transfer, and functions of metal halide perovskites.

Herein, we report a significant chiral expression resulting from two distinct mechanisms: chirality transfer induced by chiral organic cations and mirror symmetry breaking driven by stereochemically active lone pairs, both contributing to controlled chirality induction. Homochiral germanium iodide perovskites, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt; is Rectus/Sinister) can be achieved by employing chiral (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BrMBA cations to induce chirality via hydrogen bonding. In contrast, two enantiomorphous helical germanium iodide perovskites, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; is Plus/Minus&#160;and &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt; is racemic), are formed via the co-assembly of racemic &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA cations and germanium iodide networks, where chirality arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the stereochemically active 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron pair. Remarkably, benefiting from the inherent chirality, both (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BrMBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;GeI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystals exhibit exceptional anisotropic nonlinear optical properties with large anisotropy factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SHG-CD&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 0.71 and 0.83 and laser damage thresholds of 697.5 and 535.2 GW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing most previously reported CMHPs. This study provides insight into the interplay of chiral organic ligands and inorganic ions in the chiral induction, transfer, and functions of metal halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Para&#8208;Substituent Control of Thermal Half&#8208;Lives in Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we provide an overview of photochromic and photophysical properties of a broad variety of arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches, including the influence of 23 different para&#8208;substituents. Measured half&#8208;lives correlated in a Hammet plot are rationalized by density functional theory calculations, revealing the underlying thermal isomerization mechanisms. The nature of the substituent controls the Z/E thermal isomerization pathway.








Abstract
Arylazopyrazoles are versatile photoswitches with excellent photochromic properties and tunable thermal half&#8208;lives, yet the mechanistic role of substituents in controlling thermal stability remains poorly understood. Here, we synthesized an extensive library of arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches and rationalized the influence of para&#8208;substituents on the thermal half&#8208;lives, finding excellent agreement between calculated and measured trends. Calculations show that the electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the substituents modulates the back&#8208;isomerization process through at least two distinct mechanisms. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups enhance delocalization at the azo moiety and thus favor a nonadiabatic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane rotational pathway via the lowest triplet state. In contrast, strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups reduce delocalization and promote a conventional ground state in&#8208;plane inversion mechanism. Intermediate substituents exhibit a gradual shift that combines both major mechanisms. These findings provide prospects for rational design of responsive photoswitches with controllable thermal stability, essential for in vivo applications.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedron&#8208;to&#8208;Coordination Polymer Transition Revealed by 3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we show that 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) is an effective technique to observe structural transformations in porous metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), as well as for obtaining the structure of the activated phases of these materials. A MOP&#8208;to&#8208;coordination polymer transition is revealed, and explains the reduction in cooperative gas uptake by the material as it is mechanically downsized via ball milling.








Abstract
Porous metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) have strong covalent and coordinate bonds that define the intrinsic pore of the cage. The intermolecular interactions between cages tend to be weaker, such that they rearrange during the solvent exchange process preceding gas sorption measurements. The reduction in crystal size that this often causes limits the availability of structural data that could enable understanding of observed gas uptake. Herein, we use 3D electron diffraction (ED) to resolve this problem, and apply this technique to a MOP&#8208;based material that shows cooperative gas capture. 3D ED structure solution reveals both that the MOPs rearrange to form porous 1D polymers, and that these polymers are retained in the activated phase. Molecular simulations using these data suggest gas uptake is facilitated by rotation of functional groups appended to the backbone of the polymers in conjunction with structural expansion as gas is accommodated. Mechanical downsizing of the material leads to the loss of cooperative gas uptake, but a level of porosity is retained, attributed to the conservation of the 1D polymer structure. This work underscores the potential of 3D ED for probing structural transformations in functional supramolecular materials.

         <title>Convergent Electrochemical&#8211;Chemical Tandem Catalysis Synthesis of Ethylene Oxide from CO2 and Water at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem electrochemical&#8211;chemical system that couples CO2 reduction (CO2R) toward C2H4 and two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) toward H2O2 in a single electrolyzer with ambient epoxidation was reported to produce ethylene oxide (EO) from CO2 and H2O.








Abstract
Ethylene oxide (EO) is an important commodity chemical, and its production currently relies on fossil fuel&#8208;based energy&#8208;intensive thermocatalysis associated with substantial CO2 emissions or the usage of toxic/corrosive precursors (e.g., Cl2). Herein, we report a convergent electrochemical&#8211;chemical tandem route for efficient synthesis of EO from CO2 and water under ambient conditions over nonprecious catalysts. Such a protype consists of cathodic CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 and simultaneous anodic two&#8208;electron water electrooxidation (2e&#8208;WOR) to H2O2 in a single electrolyzer, followed by reaction of the two products over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst toward EO with high production rate of 422.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of&#160;&gt;98%. W&#8208;doped CuOx and Cu&#8208;doped SnO2 were used as cathode and anode electrodes with respective Faradaic efficiencies of 63.5% and 75.6% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Systematic characterizations, including 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), isotope&#8208;labeling mass spectrometry (MS), and operando infrared spectroscopy, along with theoretical calculations, reveal that Cu doping breaks the electronic structure symmetry of Sn to induce electron redistribution for optimal adsorption and coupling of key intermediates like *OH in 2e&#8208;WOR. This study offers a sustainable manner for efficient EO synthesis from raw materials with renewable electricity input.

         <title>Dendritic Pillar[6]Arenes with Fixed Planar Chirality for Stereoselective Inclusions in Water: A Case of Facile Differentiation of Cocaine Adulterants, Levamisole and Dexamisole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic pillar[6]arenes encompass a new class of cavitands with planar chirality, unique binding pockets, and great water solubility. These easily accessible hosts permit differentiating racemic dexamisole from levamisole as known cocaine adulterants. Dendritic pillar[6]arenes can now be used for stereoselective recognition, chemosensing, and sequestration of a broad range of chiral drugs. 








Abstract
We describe the preparation, conformational dynamics, and stereoselective recognition characteristics of water&#8208;soluble pillar[6]arenes pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722;. These two novel and diastereomeric cavitands comprise a 2,5&#8208;bis(ethoxy)pillar[6]arene core with one of six phenylene ring conjugated to two hexaanionic dendrons. Each dendron includes an (S)&#8722;glutamic acid amidated with two tris&#8208;carboxylic Behera's amines. Cavitands pS&#8211;212&#8722; and pR&#8211;212&#8722; were obtained in six synthetic steps and resolved by column chromatography. The results of 1H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements are in line with pS/pR&#8211;212&#8722; having unidirectional orientation of alkoxy substituents (i.e., planar chirality) and no observable interconversion for, at least, 2 weeks. Computational studies supported with 1H DOSY NMR measurements revealed that sufficiently bulky dendrons require high activation energy to pass through the pillararene's cylindrical cavity therefore inhibiting rotation of the phenylene holding them. With the unique and chiral binding pocket, pS&#8211;212&#8722; (pR&#8211;212&#8722;) formed inclusion complexes with cocaine adulterants levamisole and dexamisole (Kd&#160;&gt;&#160;mM), with their racemic mixture showing separate 1H NMR spectroscopic resonances. In this way, dendritic pillar[6]arenes can be used as chiral shift reagents for determining enantiopurity of pharmaceuticals but also for examining a variety of chiral recognition processes, sensing of chiral molecules, and stereoselective sequestrations in aqueous media.

&lt;p&gt;Dendritic pillar[6]arenes encompass a new class of cavitands with planar chirality, unique binding pockets, and great water solubility. These easily accessible hosts permit differentiating racemic dexamisole from levamisole as known cocaine adulterants. Dendritic pillar[6]arenes can now be used for stereoselective recognition, chemosensing, and sequestration of a broad range of chiral drugs. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the preparation, conformational dynamics, and stereoselective recognition characteristics of water-soluble pillar[6]arenes &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. These two novel and diastereomeric cavitands comprise a 2,5-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;(ethoxy)pillar[6]arene core with one of six phenylene ring conjugated to two hexaanionic dendrons. Each dendron includes an (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;glutamic acid amidated with two &lt;i&gt;tris&lt;/i&gt;-carboxylic Behera's amines. Cavitands &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; were obtained in six synthetic steps and resolved by column chromatography. The results of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements are in line with &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; having unidirectional orientation of alkoxy substituents (i.e., planar chirality) and no observable interconversion for, at least, 2 weeks. Computational studies supported with &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H DOSY NMR measurements revealed that sufficiently bulky dendrons require high activation energy to pass through the pillararene's cylindrical cavity therefore inhibiting rotation of the phenylene holding them. With the unique and chiral binding pocket, &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) formed inclusion complexes with cocaine adulterants levamisole and dexamisole (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;mM), with their racemic mixture showing separate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopic resonances. In this way, dendritic pillar[6]arenes can be used as chiral shift reagents for determining enantiopurity of pharmaceuticals but also for examining a variety of chiral recognition processes, sensing of chiral molecules, and stereoselective sequestrations in aqueous media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy Dissipation Mediated by Multiple Noncovalent Interactions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Hydrogels for Wearable Gesture&#8208;to&#8208;Recognition Translation</title>

         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;hard multiphase hydrogels have been constructed using hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and polymerized deep eutectic solvent, the multiple noncovalent interactions facilitate the energy dissipation and ion transport, leading to remarkable strength, toughness and ionic conductivity. They could be used as strain sensors for health monitoring and gesture&#8208;to&#8208;recognition translation.








Abstract
Hydrogels hold great promises in intelligent wearable gesture&#8208;to&#8208;recognition translation devices, but high mechanical robustness usually encounters low sensitivity and poor cycling stability, it is pivotal and challenging to balance energy dissipation and conductivity. Herein, the soft&#8208;hard multiphase hydrogels have been proposed for the first time through noncovalently threading polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Fluorine groups on HOF (HOF&#8208;F) are presented as the hydrogen bond acceptors to form multiple noncovalent interactions between HOF&#8208;F and PDES, which expedites the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport in hydrogels. The tensile strength, toughness and ionic conductivity are as high as 135.23&#160;kPa, 2.69&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and 4.33&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly outperforms that of H&#8208;substituted counterpart (60.04&#160;kPa, 0.75&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and 3.74&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08 S m&#8722;1) and ranks the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves high sensitivity of 2.2 and remarkable cyclic stability over 1000 cycles, thus accurately monitoring human motion and recognizing the gesture. This work provides a promising approach to develop smart flexible electronics.

         <title>Programmable Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Through Stereocontrol of Chiral Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Co&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral inducers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) with varying binaphthalene dihedral angles were selected with achiral liquid crystalline polymer PyP to form chiral co&#8208;assemblies. As the dihedral angle of the binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9 could emit inverted and amplified circularly polarized electroluminescence with a |gEL| value up to 0.18 compared with (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) are essential to prospective 3D displays and advanced polarized lighting systems. The rational design of programmable circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) materials with a large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (gEL) remains a great challenge and is still in its preliminary exploration phase. In this work, two aggregation induced emission active (AIE&#8208;active) chiral inducers with different dihedral angles of binaphthalene (S&#8208;/R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;/R&#8208;2) and achiral acrylate&#8208;based liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) (PyP) were chosed to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. Interestingly, as the dihedral angle of the AIE&#8208;active binaphthyl inducer decreased from obtuse to acute angle, the resulting co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2&#8208;PyP) could emit inverted and amplified CP&#8208;EL signals compared with S&#8208;/R&#8208;1&#8208;PyP after annealing. Significantly, the (S&#8208;/R&#8208;2)0.1&#8208;(PyP)0.9&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs displayed remarkable blue CP&#8208;EL (&#955;EL&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nm, Lmax&#160;=&#160;14860&#160;cd m&#8722;2) with a record |gEL| value of up to 0.18 in chiral co&#8208;assembled CP&#8208;OLEDs to date. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CP&#8208;EL with tunable signal direction and intensity through stereocontrol of AIE&#8208;active chiral inducers in LCP co&#8208;assembled films, providing a valuable guidance for realizing programmable CP&#8208;EL.

RHM enables adaptive water capture and release in AZIBs, promoting uniform Zn deposition, fast Zn2&#8314; transport, and stable cycling.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, uncontrolled interfacial water remains a major hurdle, limiting both anode stability and ion transport. In this study, 2&#8208;picolinaldehyde (2PA) was chosen as a reversible hydration modulator (RHM) that enables dynamic regulation of interfacial free water. Spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that RHM captures excess water during plating to suppress hydrogen evolution and corrosion while releasing water during stripping to facilitate Zn2+ solvation and migration. In addition, RHM coordinates with Zn2+ and reorganizes its local coordination environment. Consequently, symmetric cells with the RHM&#8208;ZnSO4 electrolyte deliver prolonged cycling exceeding 4000&#160;h and excellent rate performance, with low voltage polarization even at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The corresponding full cells demonstrate durable operation for over 5000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This adaptive behavior satisfies the distinct interfacial water requirements during Zn plating and stripping, enabling interfacial stability and efficient ion transport, and provides a novel strategy for electrolyte design in AZIBs.

         <title>Antiferroelectric SnO2 Network with Amorphous Surface for Electrochemical N2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study report the utilization of antiferroelectric dipole configurations to engineer oriented electric fields to synergistically couple N2 adsorption. Building on this foundation, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surface was engineered to maximize N2 adsorption efficiency and active site accessibility. As a result, this design achieves one of the highest performance and efficiency reported to date for aqueous electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen fixation&#8208;a sustainable pathway for converting abundant N2 into NH3 using renewable energy&#8208;holds transformative potential for revolutionizing artificial nitrogen cycles. Nevertheless, even the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems also suffer from inadequate N2 adsorption capacity, which critically limits ammonia production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). To overcome this bottleneck, we strategically leveraged the antiferroelectric properties of SnO2 to establish dipole&#8211;dipole interactions with N2 molecules, synergistically enhancing both N2 adsorption and activation kinetics. Building on this foundation, we construct a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surfaces. Both experiment and first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that all the exposed antiferroelectric surfaces could effectively adsorb N2, enhancing the N2 adsorption ability and maximizing active sites accessibility. The optimized catalyst delivers exceptional performance, achieving an NH3 production rate of 57.38&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1mg&#8722;1cat and a FE of 33.26%, representing one of the highest reported values among aqueous&#8208;phase ammonia synthesis catalysts. These breakthroughs not only establish a universal design framework for gas&#8208;involving electrocatalysts but also pioneer an integrated strategy to elevate nitrogen utilization efficiency in next&#8208;generation sustainable energy infrastructures.

         <title>Unlocks Photoluminescence Quantum Efficiency Enhancement in Eu2+&#8208;Doped Phosphors via Bond Angle Variance Index</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design and quantitatively prediction of high&#8208;efficiency Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors via crystallochemical descriptors are urgently needed. Here, we pioneered a linear equation between PLQY and Bav in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and achieves 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement by controlling bond angle variance (Bav).








Abstract
Rational design of inorganic luminescent materials with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has long been constrained by the absence of precise structural descriptors. Here, we realizes a giant 15.7&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement in apatite&#8208;type La9&#8722;xLuxBi(SiO4)6O3:Eu2+ phosphors and demonstrates that bond angle variance (Bav, &#948;2) can be used as a universal crystallochemical metric. By decoupling the contributions from structural rigidity, thermal quenching (TQ), and cation disorder, we identify isovalent Lu3+ substitution&#8208;driven Bav engineering, and further establish a predictive Bav&#8208;PLQY linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.95) via a generalized distortion quantification model for irregular polyhedra (CN&#160;=&#160;7). Local structure characterization and bond valence sum (Bvs) analyses reveal that &#948;2 modulation optimizes the coordination environments for Eu2+ incorporation while enhancing radiative transitions. This work bridges lattice distortion to PLQY via the Bav descriptor, offering a predictive route toward designing inorganic phosphor and advancing material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to database approaches.

         <title>In Situ Nanoscale Probing of Lithium&#8208;Aluminum Alloying / De&#8208;Alloying Kinetics and Mechanical Failure in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy (OM), we directly observed the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure of the Al&#8208;Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Furthermore, a co&#8208;sintering interfacial optimization was applied to decrease the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure and increase the cycle stability of Li&#8208;anode&#8208;less ASSBs.








Abstract
Alloy anodes with high specific capacity are extensively utilized in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, they are challenged by interfacial kinetic and mechanical issues. Real&#8208;time investigation of interfacial failure mechanisms at the nanoscale is crucial for optimizing the alloy anodes. Utilizing the high spatial resolution and real&#8208;time imaging capabilities of electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM), we discovered that Li1Al1 alloying unevenly, and the delithiated phase Al with its sluggish kinetics hinders the de&#8208;alloying processes. Combining the high mechanical modulus of Li1Al1 and Al leads to electrode fracture. This kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure diminishes the reversibility of the Al anode. To weaken the kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupling failure, we employ a co&#8208;sintering reaction between Al and Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl), introducing Al2S3 and P2S74&#8722;, followed by Al2S3 in situ lithiation to Li9Al4. This process improved interfacial charge transfer and mitigated mechanical failure. Consequently, the Li&#8208;anode&#8208;less ASSBs maintain 90.2% retention rate after 2000&#160;h (420 cycles) and 87.4% retention rate after 3500&#160;h (750 cycles) at an areal capacity of 2.9&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and low N/P ratio of 1.8 with a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Such tracking of the alloy interfacial reaction provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of kinetic&#8208;mechanical coupled failure and thus benefits the alloy anode optimization.

         <title>Creating Abundant Open Metal Sites in MOFs by Dual&#8208;Coordination Design for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;coordination strategy is developed to create abundant unsaturated metal sites in MOFs while preserving their crystalline framework, enabling precise structure&#8211;property studies and enhanced electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined crystalline structures offer ideal platforms to unravel structure&#8211;property relationships, but their low density of accessible metal sites limits catalytic activation. Efforts to generate open metal sites often compromise structural integrity, obstructing mechanistic investigation. In this study, we convert single&#8208;coordinated MOFs into dual&#8208;coordinated frameworks, enabling controlled creation of unsaturated metal sites to boost electrocatalytic performance while preserving crystal framework for structure&#8211;property study. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we transform Zn&#9472;N single&#8208;coordinated ZIF&#8208;L into Zn&#9472;N/O dual&#8208;coordinated MOFs (B&#8208;MOFs), where strong Zn&#9472;N bonds act as structural pillars and weaker Zn&#9472;O bonds serve as removable linkers. Upon annealing at 500&#160;&#176;C, selective cleavage of Zn&#9472;O bonds produces defective MOFs (dB&#8208;MOFs) with abundant open Zn sites and a well&#8208;retained crystal structure. The dB&#8208;MOF grown on carbon cloth (CC) exhibits high performance in hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), significantly superior to pristine B&#8208;MOF/CC. A combination of material characterizations and theoretical calculation demonstrates that the removal of Zn&#9472;O bond creates abundant electron&#8208;deficient Zn sites, which enhance the adsorption of HzOR intermediates and lower the reaction energy barriers.

Reduction of an amidinate&#8208;stabilized zinc iodide with KC8 in the presence of cAAC affords a crystalline zinc&#8211;cAAC radical. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculation reveal the radical's properties, and reactivity studies demonstrate its zinc&#8208;centered radical behavior toward diverse substrates. 








Abstract
Reaction of LAmZnI [LAm&#160;=&#160;tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3] with KC8 in the presence of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) affords a stable radical complex [LAmZn(cAAC)]&#8226; (3). Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis of 3 shows a short Zn&#9472;C bond and concomitant elongation of C&#9472;N bond within the cAAC ligand, indicating a significant &#960;&#8208;backbonding from the metal to the cAAC ligand. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that the spin density is mainly localized on the carbenic carbon atom, with a small portion on the zinc center. Complex 3 exhibits zinc&#8208;centered radical reactivity as demonstrated by reactions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy, iodobenzene, trimethylsilyl azide, and [FeCp(CO)2]2, all of which occur at the zinc center and yield the corresponding Zn(II) complexes.

         <title>Amino Nests Boost Pd/SiO2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Selective Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd single atoms anchored within the amino nest on the SiO2&#8208;NH2 support (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2) were successfully fabricated and exhibited robust catalytic performance in selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene with an amazing specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that amino nests can selectively capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step over the Pd single atoms.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is a critical industrial process for purifying ethylene feedstocks. Palladium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Pd SACs) exhibit exceptional ethylene selectivity in this hydrogenation reaction. However, their isolated active sites show limited ability to capture and adsorb trace acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, resulting in relatively low hydrogenation activity. To overcome this limitation, we designed Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst on the SiO2 surface modified with amino nests (Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2). In this architecture, Pd single atoms are embedded within amino nests on the surface of SiO2&#8208;NH2 support. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amino nests selectively capture and adsorb acetylene molecules from ethylene&#8208;rich streams, facilitating the key acetylene adsorption step. The Pd&#9472;N bonds formed between the amino nest and the Pd atom promote hydrogen activation. At 190 &#176;C, the Pd1/SiO2&#8208;NH2 catalyst achieves complete acetylene conversion with the ethylene selectivity of 92%. Remarkably, it delivers a specific activity of 1900.36&#160;mol C2H2&#8722;1 molPd&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, surpassing all previously reported SACs. This work establishes an amino nest&#8208;assisted design paradigm for single&#8208;atom catalysts, enabling efficient, selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene.

         <title>Mechanistically Engineered Heterojunction From Spent LFP for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;guided upcycling strategy converts spent LFP into a coronal NiO/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/LFP(III) heterostructure, achieving nanoscale surface activation for electrocatalysis. The engineered p&#8211;n interface enables lattice oxygen catalysis, while the PO43&#8722;&#8208;rich matrix ensures Cl&#8722; resistance, delivering high OER performance and a six&#8208;fold cost&#8208;efficiency gain over conventional recycling.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale retirement of LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries demands sustainable strategies for material recovery and functional repurposing. However, the inert micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and electronically stable lattice of spent LFP hinder its direct catalytic reuse. Herein, we present a structure&#8208;guided strategy that upcycles spent LFP into a high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Mild air oxidation transforms LFP into a phosphate&#8208;rich Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (LFP(III)) framework decorated with coronal &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots. This reconfiguration preserves the bulk structure while achieving nanoscale surface activation. Subsequent spatially selective growth of NiO on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 yields a well&#8208;defined p&#8208;NiO/n&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction, driving interfacial charge redistribution and promoting formation of catalytically active NiOOH species under operational conditions. In situ Raman and XPS analyses reveal that the heterostructure facilitates lattice oxygen participation via an accelerated lattice oxygen mechanism, while the phosphate&#8208;rich LFP(III) matrix imparts strong electrostatic repulsion toward Cl&#8722;, effectively suppressing halide&#8208;induced corrosion. The resulting LFP(III)/NiO catalyst achieves low overpotentials of 268 and 292&#160;mV at 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in chloride&#8208;containing electrolytes, along with excellent durability. Techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates a six&#8208;fold improvement in cost&#8208;efficiency over conventional recycling. This work establishes a mechanistically informed and energy&#8208;efficient upcycling strategy that bridges battery waste management with functional catalyst design, advancing both sustainable materials chemistry and water&#8208;splitting technologies.

         <title>Ligand Engineering&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Activity of Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;Siloxane Clusters for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz nanoclusters are surgically sculpted into the octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC) configuration through ligand engineering, where each ligand in OZSBPC is adorned with an appended benzene ring. Benefitting from the electronic and molecular modulation effect of benzene rings, the reinforced electrical conductivity, sulfur loading capacity, and adsorption characteristics are endowed to the OZSBPC, ultimately achieving the optimization of lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic performance.








Abstract
Polynuclear metal clusters (PMC) with atomically defined architectures exhibit unique electrochemical catalytic behaviors in lithium&#8722;sulfur battery (LSB). Nevertheless, the precise fabrication of PMC with tailored configurations, and a comprehensive understanding of their structure&#8208;dependent property evolution, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, ligand engineering is employed to upgrade octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz clusters by grafting one more benzene ring onto azopyrazole ligand to form octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC). An integrated investigation combining kinetic analyses, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveals that the introduction of biphenyl moieties enlarges the intrinsic cavity to host more sulfur species, while the conjugation&#8208;enhanced ligand framework facilitates more efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the enhanced nucleophilicity at nitrogen sites and the upshifted d&#8208;band center synergistically strengthen the affinity toward polysulfides via &#960;&#8722;&#960; conjugation interactions. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of OZSBPC undergoes a substantial enhancement, thereby enabling the assembled Ah&#8208;class Li&#8722;S pouch cell delivers a peak energy density of 504&#160;Wh&#160;kgtotal&#8722;1, and sustains stable cycling at 429&#160;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1 for 40 cycles. Moreover, stable operation over 150 cycles is achieved under &#8722;33&#160;&#176;C. Our study makes a breakthrough in precisely constructing PMC and in optimizing the performance via progressive structure upgrading, which made a landmark impact on lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic chemistry.

Benefitting from the electronic and molecular modulation effect of benzene rings, the reinforced electrical conductivity, sulfur loading capacity, and adsorption characteristics are endowed to the OZSBPC, ultimately achieving the optimization of lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polynuclear metal clusters (PMC) with atomically defined architectures exhibit unique electrochemical catalytic behaviors in lithium&#8722;sulfur battery (LSB). Nevertheless, the precise fabrication of PMC with tailored configurations, and a comprehensive understanding of their structure-dependent property evolution, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, ligand engineering is employed to upgrade octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;PhPz clusters by grafting one more benzene ring onto azopyrazole ligand to form octanuclear Zn(II)&#8722;siloxane&#8722;BiPhPz clusters (OZSBPC). An integrated investigation combining kinetic analyses, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveals that the introduction of biphenyl moieties enlarges the intrinsic cavity to host more sulfur species, while the conjugation-enhanced ligand framework facilitates more efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the enhanced nucleophilicity at nitrogen sites and the upshifted d-band center synergistically strengthen the affinity toward polysulfides via &#960;&#8722;&#960; conjugation interactions. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of OZSBPC undergoes a substantial enhancement, thereby enabling the assembled Ah-class Li&#8722;S pouch cell delivers a peak energy density of 504&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and sustains stable cycling at 429&#160;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 40 cycles. Moreover, stable operation over 150 cycles is achieved under &#8722;33&#160;&#176;C. Our study makes a breakthrough in precisely constructing PMC and in optimizing the performance via progressive structure upgrading, which made a landmark impact on lithium&#8722;sulfur catalytic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>LL&#8208;37 and Its Truncated Fragments Modulate Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Dynamics, Aggregation and Toxicity Through Hetero&#8208;Oligomer and Cluster Formation</title>

LL&#8208;37 and its truncates modulate A&#946;40 primary nucleation by forming hetero&#8208;oligomers, nanoclusters, and microclusters, which act as off&#8208;pathway aggregates inhibiting fibrillation. These transient assemblies influence fibril progression and cytotoxicity, highlighting the dynamic interplay between aggregation and toxicity. Integrating nanoscale and microscale perspectives provides mechanistic insight into A&#946;40&#8211;LL&#8208;37 interactions and informs therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
LL&#8208;37 and its variants with amphiphilic structure can modulate amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibril formation, but the detailed mechanism behind it is still unclear. By using four different peptides (LL&#8208;37, LL&#8208;379&#8211;32, LL&#8208;3718&#8211;29, LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28), we found these peptides affect A&#946;40 aggregation differently. Nanoscale analysis showed that all LL&#8208;37 peptides form hetero&#8208;oligomers and nanoclusters with A&#946;40, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28, which exhibit the strongest inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation, form more hetero&#8208;oligomers and smaller nanoclusters. This suggests that hetero&#8208;oligomers and small nanoclusters may represent an off&#8208;pathway, preventing the formation of productive aggregates. At the microscale, all LL&#8208;37 peptides were found to promote A&#946; cluster formation, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 can form larger clusters with A&#946; rapidly, emphasizing that smaller nanoclusters can assemble to macroscale clusters easier, inducing more toxic aggregates. Both nanoscopic and microscopic mechanisms revealed inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation by all LL&#8208;37 peptides, impacting A&#946; primary and secondary nucleation, while only LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 affected A&#946; elongation. Our findings highlight the role of LL&#8208;37 and its synthetic fragments in A&#946;40 aggregation across different scales, particularly focusing on cluster formation at the nanoscale and microscale to fill the knowledge gap between oligomerization and fibrillation.

         <title>Harnessing Dual Hydrogen Bonding and Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Interactions for Bio&#8208;Inspired Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Electrolytes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Bio&#8208;inspired symmetry disruption in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries: Isobutyramide simultaneously breaks hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and coordinates Zn2+ ions, tailoring solvation structure and stabilizing Zn anodes. This molecular&#8208;level electrolyte engineering suppresses dendrites, mitigates hydrogen evolution, and enables long&#8208;lasting, high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) offer a safe, cost&#8208;effective alternative for large&#8208;scale energy storage but are hindered by zinc dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and unstable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. These challenges largely stem from strong dipole interactions between symmetric water molecules and Zn2+, which destabilize the electric double layer (EDL) and trigger parasitic reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological systems that use asymmetric molecular interactions to regulate aqueous environments, we introduce isobutyramide (IAM) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive. IAM features both carbonyl and amide groups, enabling it to act as a dual&#8208;site hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. This disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in water, reduces water activity, and suppresses HER. Additionally, IAM's lone pairs coordinate strongly with Zn2+, restructuring the solvation sheath and mitigating uncontrolled Zn2+ migration that leads to dendrite formation. This dual&#8208;function, symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy stabilizes the EDL, enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility, and suppresses interfacial degradation. Electrochemical tests confirm IAM's efficacy: Zn||Cu cells exhibit 99.68% Coulombic efficiency over 1,000 cycles, Zn||Zn symmetric cells remain stable for over 4,250&#160;h, and full&#8208;cell Zn||V2O5 and Zn||I2 systems show significantly enhanced cycling performance. Zn||I2 pouch cells also demonstrate robust long&#8208;term operation. This bio&#8208;inspired approach offers a scalable path to high&#8208;performance, practical aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;Labeled Oximes by Alloy Synergy Activation and Hydroxylamine Overhydrogenation Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>

BixMoy alloys are designed to electrocatalytic conversion of 15NO2&#8210; to 15N&#8208;oxime with a 76% Faradaic efficiency and 88% yield at 3.0 A. Mo serves as the H2O activation site, whereas Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8210; activation site. The synergy between Bi and Mo leads to a high 15N&#8208;oxime formation rate. Moreover, Mo introduction increases the hydrogenation energy barrier for 15NH2OH to 15NH3, suppressing 15NH2OH overhydrogenation and therefore improving 15N&#8208;oxime Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
15N&#8208;labeled molecules are essential for industrial drug development and medical imageology. However, the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled molecules suffers from the complex procedure of de novo synthesis and harsh conditions. Here, we propose an electrochemical strategy to synthesize 15N&#8208;labeled oximes (15N&#8208;oximes) from 15N&#8208;labeled nitrites (15NO2&#8722;) and aldehydes/ketones. Matching the adsorption and activation of H2O and 15NO2&#8722; and inhibiting 15NH2OH overhydrogenation are the keys to realizing efficient ampere&#8208;level electrosynthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled oximes. A bismuth&#8722;molybdenum (BiMo) alloy catalyst is subsequently designed, in which Bi acts as the 15NO2&#8722; activation site, whereas Mo serves as the H2O activation site. The precisely controlled atomic ratio of Mo and Bi ensures that there is sufficient but not excessive active hydrogen provided for 15NO2&#8722; hydrogenation and therefore accelerates the reaction rate. Moreover, Mo incorporation increases the energy barrier of 15NH2OH overhydrogenation and thus improves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 15N&#8208;oxime. This strategy enables scale&#8208;up electrosynthesis with a 76% FE and 88% yield at a current of 3.0 A to obtain 3.5 g of 15N&#8208;cyclohexanone oxime within 1.5 h. The application potential is highlighted by the methodological universality of diverse 15N&#8208;oximes, the extended synthesis of 15N&#8208;labeled drug molecules and their application in 2D magnetic resonance imaging visualization.

         <title>Hydroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Amides via Photoredox Catalysis and Triple Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with amides are achieved under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity, along with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Its versatility is highlighted by diverse late&#8208;stage modification and synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via a triple hydrogen atom transfer process involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular steps.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated hydroalkylation of alkenes offers a more direct and atom&#8208;economical route to &#945;&#8208;alkylated carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of various drug scaffolds, natural products, and functional molecules. However, traditional protocols are generally restricted to active 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and often require oxidants, large excesses of substrates, and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we present a photoinduced, general, and practical hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with amides. Both inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydroalkylation reactions are achieved under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions. This method demonstrates excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity, along with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. A range of short&#8208;chain gaseous olefins, including ethylene, can also undergo the reaction successfully. Its versatility is further highlighted by diverse late&#8208;stage modification and synthesis of structurally complex bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds via a triple hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular steps. The success of this chemistry is attributed to the controlled generation of relatively weak electrophilic &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals and the strategic application of radical polarity&#8208;match/mismatch effect to finely tune the reactivity between distinct radical species and unactivated alkenes or the HAT donor.

         <title>H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ Comproportionation Enables Stable Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F Solid Electrolyte</title>

H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation serves as an effective chemical driven force for achieving the Li2+xNHFx&#8211;LiF solid electrolyte from LiH and NH4F precursor, which enables the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to the accelerated Li&#8208;ion migration in Li2+xNHFx, favorable in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphase at the electrode surface and the enhanced mechanical strengths.








Abstract
Nitride family compounds are among the earliest explored materials for solid electrolytes (SEs). The main challenge lies in effectively enhancing their electrochemical stability without compromising their excellent Li&#8208;ion conductivity and Li metal compatibility. Herein, a H&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H&#948;+ comproportionation reaction between LiH and NH4F is employed to synthesize a Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex, consisting of Li2+xNHFx matrix and dispersed LiF nanoparticles. Density functional calculation results show that the incorporated F atoms in Li2NH lattice lead to structural variation and electron density redistribution, providing a more connected Li&#8208;ion network with low migration energy barriers. More importantly, the interfacial side reactions between the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F complex and electrodes are strongly self&#8208;limited due to the blocking effect of the in situ formed Li4NH/LiF&#8208;enriched interphases. The newly identified interphase Li4NH exhibits fast Li&#8208;ion migration ability and intrinsic stability toward Li, facilitating stable Li plating/stripping. Based on the superiority in Li&#8208;ion conduction and electrode compatibility, the Li&#8211;N&#8211;H&#8211;F solid electrolyte films prepared via cold pressing with 0.5 wt% binder enable stable cycling of Li||Li, Li||TiS2, and Li||LiCoO2 all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Micellar Brush&#8208;Directed Oxophilic Zr&#8208;Doped RuO2 Nanoarrays for Durable Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 43, October 20, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes guide the dense accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr&#8308;&#8314; ions through coordination interactions and enable the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray after calcination. The oxophilic Zr stabilizes the lattice oxygen and creates electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites, which facilitate the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER performance.








Abstract
Although being considered as a promising alternative to iridium&#8208;based catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE), cost&#8208;effective ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based anodic catalysts generally lack sufficient stability for harsh operating conditions. Here, we developed a facile method to fabricate erect nanoarrays of interweaved nanorods of zirconium&#8208;doped ruthenium oxide (ZrRuO2) for long&#8208;term industrial&#8208;level oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is accomplished by the spontaneous and abundant accumulation of Ru nanoparticles and Zr4+ ions in pyridine&#8208;rich micellar brushes through coordination interactions, followed by direct calcination in air. The uniform dispersion of Ru and Zr precursors promotes the homogeneous doping of Zr in the resulting RuO2 nanoarray and the formation of Zr&#8208;OBRI&#8208;Ru bridging oxygen structures. The oxophilic Zr strengthens the stability of the lattice oxygen and prevents its participation in OER. Meanwhile, it also leads to electron deficiency of the bridging Ru sites and facilitates the adsorption of H2O molecules and the subsequent dissociation into *OH, thus enhancing the OER stability and activity. Notably, the nanoarray architecture synergistically restricts the voltage loss caused by electron and mass transport. Consequently, the ZrRuO2&#8208;nanoarrays enabled a remarkably low PEM&#8208;WE potential of 1.64&#160;V at 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 with a negligible degradation rate (26 &#181;V h&#8722;1, over 1000&#160;h).

         <title>Remote Enantioselective Redox &#949;&#8208;Alkylation of Copper Allylic Allenylidenes with Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and copper cooperative catalytic system for the unprecedented asymmetric redox &#949;&#8208;alkylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters and yne&#8208;heteroarenic esters with isatin&#8208;derived enals. This strategy overcomes the significant challenge of achieving stereocontrol at positions remote from the catalytic center, enabling the construction of a diverse array of 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in good yields (up to 93%) with excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;95:5 dr, 99% ee).








Abstract
The development of asymmetric functionalization at positions distant from the catalytic center&#8212;achieving high complexity, diversity, and stereocontrol&#8212;poses significant challenges. Here, we introduce an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/copper cooperative catalytic strategy for the regioselective remote &#949;&#8208;alkylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters and yne&#8208;heteroarenic esters with enals, producing a diverse array of oxindoles with outstanding stereoselectivity (up to &gt;95:5 dr, 99% ee). Remarkably, copper allylic allenylidenes are proven to be compatible with NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, facilitating efficient, regioselective, and stereoselective intermolecular C&#9472;C bond formation at distant sites.

         <title>Mechanical Constraints Promote Noncanonical Base&#8208;Pairing Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanobenders were designed to introduce mechanical constraints to single&#8208;stranded DNA/RNA by forming loop structures, allowing modulation of mechanical parameters and visualization of weak interactions via multivalent cooperative binding. Results suggest that mechanical constraints promote noncanonical base&#8208;pairing, likely through entropy compensation and hydrophobic exposure. 








Abstract
Mechanical perturbations profoundly influence nucleobase interactions in cells, serving as key modulators of fundamental cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation. However, their precise roles remain elusive due to methodological limitations. Here, we have developed a DNA origami&#8208;based nanobender system that probes base&#8211;base interactions under mechanical constraints. This system imposes tunable geometric and mechanical constraints on single&#8208;stranded DNA/RNA by pulling its two ends together while adjusting its contour length, and enables the assessment of weak interactions between bases through the detection of DNA origami dimerization. Combining experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we speculate that mechanical constraints promote stacking&#8208;driven noncanonical base&#8208;pairing via entropy compensation and favorable nucleobase orientation (hydrophobic exposure), advancing our understanding of base recognition diversity. Customizable nanobender parameters allow investigation of the effects of geometric and mechanical constraints on hybridization thermodynamics across DNA&#8208;DNA, RNA&#8208;RNA, DNA&#8208;RNA, and epigenetically modified nucleotides. Notably, we suggest that entropy modulation mediated by mechanical constraints enables fine&#8208;tuning of binding free energy, thereby expanding material assembly applications while conferring environmental sensitivity.

         <title>Four Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Mediate Oxidation Cascades in the Biosynthesis of Cephalotane&#8208;Type Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel cytochrome P450 enzymes, CsCYP1&#8211;CsCYP4, were functionally characterised for catalysing the formation of the characteristic 13,17&#8208;lactone, 5,19&#8208;lactone, and tropone moieties in the biosynthesis of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids. Accordingly, the co&#8208;expression of these characterised CYP450 enzymes along with cephalotene synthase (CsCTS) in Nicotiana benthamiana enables the production of a wide range of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids.








Abstract
Cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids, a class of natural products exclusively found in Cephalotaxus plants, are well known for their attractive structures and potent biological activities. However, their low natural abundance and intricate cage&#8208;like structures hinder their accessibility. Recently, the identification of a cephalotene synthase (CsCTS) has addressed the first committed step in the biosynthesis. However, the enzymes involved in the complex post&#8208;modification of the cephalotene core into structurally diverse cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids remain obscure. In this study, we functionally characterised four novel cytochrome P450 enzymes from C. sinensis. These enzymes demonstrate multiple oxidative functions and cooperatively catalyse a cascade of oxidation reactions, including the formation of signature 13,17&#8208;lactone, 5,19&#8208;lactone, and tropone. We further co&#8208;expressed the characterised CYP450 enzymes in combination with CsCTS to produce a variety of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids, including hainanolidol (2), mannolide C (3), mannolide A (4), and cephinoid H (5), in Nicotiana benthamiana. Subsequently, harringtonolide (1) was chemically converted from hainanolidol (3.9&#160;&#181;mol with 10 equiv of Pb(OAc)4) in 87.5% yield. In this study, the biosynthetic pathways of representative cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids were elucidated and reconstructed, thereby establishing a foundation for their sustainable production through biosynthesis and/or chemo&#8208;biosynthesis, highlighting the remarkable efficiency of merely five Cephalotaxus&#8208;specific enzymes in assembling such structurally complex natural products.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Ru1Au6(TBBT)6(PPh3)6 Cluster Catalyst for Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we synthesize an atomically precise Ru1Au6(TBBT)6(PPh3)6 cluster consisted of one central Ru atom and six peripheral Au(TBBT)PPh3 complexes bridged by the S atoms. This cluster shows a high efficiency for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia, since the Ru site and six Au sites match well in this reaction.








Abstract
Only one active site in a catalyst is not able to handle a deal of multitasking at once to facilitate distinct elementary steps in a catalytic cycle. To overcome this, a multi&#8208;functional system is required by two or more functional units combined in one catalyst, with each unit playing a complementary role. Here we find that the Au site of Au(TBBT)PPh3 (TBBT&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzenethiol) complex not only activates water but also reduces nitrate to ammonia, resulting in a low efficiency for the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate. To decouple the responsibility of the Au site, we synthesize a Ru1Au6(TBBT)6(PPh3)6 cluster consisted of one Ru atom and six Au(TBBT)PPh3 complexes bridged by the S atoms, in which the water dissociation is mostly undertaken on the Ru site for the steady supply of proton, while the nitrate is sequentially reduced on the Au sites. More notably, the hopping of proton from Ru to Au is readily proceeded over the S bridge, giving rise to positively cooperative couple of one Ru site and six Au sites among this cluster, and thereby 19&#8208;fold efficiency increase is observed in comparison to this complex catalyst.

         <title>A&#8208;Site Cation&#8208;Regulated Operando Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides for Selective Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable Cu&#8208;based perovskites demonstrate that A&#8208;site chemistry dictates catalyst reconstruction and CO reduction selectivity. Alkaline&#8208;earth A&#8208;sites induce Cu clustering to promote C2+ formation, whereas rare&#8208;earth A&#8208;sites stabilize Cu+ species favoring CH4. Operando spectroscopy and DFT highlight A&#8208;site&#8211;dependent Cu&#8211;O interactions as the governing design principle.








Abstract
Understanding the correlation between surface catalytic motifs and electrochemical reaction pathways is crucial for the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts, yet remains hindered by the dynamic reconfiguration of active sites under operating conditions. In this study, we establish a tunable platform based on a series of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides with systematically varied A&#8208;site cations to investigate how A&#8208;site chemistry regulates the structural dynamics of Cu and its interplay with the carbon monoxide reduction (COR) pathway. Operando spectroscopic analyses reveal that those perovskites with alkaline&#8208;earth A&#8208;site cations promote Cu clustering into metallic states, favoring multicarbon product formation. In contrast, rare&#8208;earth A&#8208;site perovskites stabilize surface Cu+ species through strong Cu&#8211;O interactions, thereby enhancing the selectivity of methane. Complementary theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the Cu&#9472;O bond strength&#8212;modulated by A&#8208;site composition&#8212;dictates the electrochemical stability of Cu active sites. These findings underscore the pivotal role of local coordination environments in steering catalyst reconstruction and product distribution, and provide guiding principles for A&#8208;site engineering in perovskite&#8208;based COR catalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic heterocycle engineering stabilizes TEMPO by redistributing charge and suppressing proton&#8208;induced degradation, as reported by Gang He et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202512613).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Research Article by Ye Liu and co&#8208;workers e202507976 a novel family of polyketone thermoplastic elastomers was synthesized through the carbonylative polymerization of ethylene and biomass&#8208;sourced polar monomers. Enabled by the alternating ketone sequence, these polyketone elastomers exhibit high strength and thermal resistance, while simultaneously achieving industrial durability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life degradability, which positions them as promising candidates for high&#8208;temperature and sustainable applications.

         <title>Discovery of a Serine&#8208;Directed Chemical Reaction for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Modification via Phage Display Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces CuII&#8208;assisted serine arylation (CASA), a serine&#8208;selective protein modification method discovered through phage display technology. Unlike traditional approaches requiring unnatural amino acids, CASA employs a CuII&#8208;mediated hydroxyl&#8208;arylation reaction to precisely target single serine residues within complex proteins. By enabling rapid protein labeling, CASA also streamlines the production of homogeneous antibody&#8211;drug conjugates with enhanced therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Conventional biocompatible chemistry typically depends on unnatural functional groups, such as alkynes and azides. Here, we present a natural amino acid&#8208;based alternative by leveraging phage display to discover CuII&#8208;assisted serine arylation (CASA), a serine&#8208;selective strategy for chemical protein modification, achieved through a CuII&#8208;mediated hydroxyl&#8208;arylation reaction. CASA enables fast and precise modification of a single serine hydroxyl group within complex proteins while leaving the other amino acids, including serines at other sites, unmodified. CASA demonstrates robust performance in on&#8208;demand modification of diverse recombinant proteins, including therapeutic antibodies, with single&#8208;residue precision. The system's ability to selectively target individual proteins within crude cell lysates suggests its potential for applications in complex biological environments and positions it as a versatile tool for protein engineering.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alcohol Derivatives with Chlorosilanes via Pyridines&#8208;Promoted Si&#9472;Cl Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a new approach to access silyl radicals via pyridines&#8208;promoted reductive activation of chlorosilanes using magnesium, and demonstrates its application in the reductive cross&#8208;coupling with benzyl, allyl, and propargyl ethers, providing an efficient and step&#8208;economical route for synthesizing diverse benzyl&#8208;, allyl&#8208;, and allenylsilanes. 








Abstract
The development of efficient approaches mediated by silyl radicals for constructing C&#9472;Si bonds is of great interest and importance, yet methods to generate these intermediates from readily available chlorosilanes remain scarce. Herein, we report a new strategy for silyl radical generation via pyridines&#8208;promoted reductive Si&#9472;Cl activation of chlorosilanes and demonstrate its application in the reductive cross&#8208;coupling with a wide array of benzyl, allyl, and propargyl alcohol derivatives. This protocol offers an efficient and step&#8208;economical route for the synthesis of diverse benzyl&#8208;, allyl&#8208;, and allenylsilanes, featuring broad substrate scope and easy scalability. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the coupling reaction was initiated by the reductive Si&#9472;Cl activation of chlorosilanes with magnesium promoted by pyridine derivatives, which generates silyl radicals. These silyl radicals subsequently mediate the deoxygenation of alcohol derivatives to form carbon radicals, culminating in C&#9472;Si radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Engineered Iron Porphyrin Boosting Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrite to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation&#8208;modified FeTMA synthesized via a molecular engineering strategy achieved almost 100% NH3 FE in the NO2RR. This is attributed to the fact that the cations enhance the adsorption of NO2&#8722; and dissociation of NH4+ on FeTMA through Coulombic interactions.








Abstract
Excessive discharge of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) into the natural environment disrupts the nitrogen cycle and poses significant health risks. Metalloporphyrins are recognized as ideal electrocatalysts owing to their well&#8208;defined M&#9472;N4 coordination and tunable structural properties. In this study, iron 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(N, N&#8208;dimethylaniline) (FeDMA) and iron 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(N, N, N&#8208;trimethylbenzenaminium) (FeTMA) were synthesized from iron tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) by introducing electron&#8208;donating dimethylammonio and electron&#8208;withdrawing trimethylammonio substituents. We systematically investigated the influence of substituent effects on the catalytic activity of iron porphyrins for the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR). FeTMA achieved exceptional performance, maintaining &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 over a broad potential range (&#8722;1.1 to &#8722;1.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl) and a peak NH3 yield rate of 458&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. The NH3 yield rate was 1.9 and 1.5 times that of FeDMA and FeTPP, respectively. Homogeneous electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses identified FeI as the active center for the NO2RR. Theoretical simulations and experimental results revealed that trimethylammonio cations enhance NO2&#8722; adsorption and facilitate NH4+ desorption through Coulombic interactions, ultimately enhancing the catalytic activity. This study demonstrates that cation&#8208;engineered metalloporphyrins are a robust strategy for NO2RR, providing valuable guidance for ammonia synthesis.

FeTMA achieved exceptional performance, maintaining &amp;gt;90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; over a broad potential range (&#8722;1.1 to &#8722;1.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl) and a peak NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 458&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;&#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate was 1.9 and 1.5 times that of FeDMA and FeTPP, respectively. Homogeneous electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses identified Fe&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; as the active center for the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Theoretical simulations and experimental results revealed that trimethylammonio cations enhance NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and facilitate NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desorption through Coulombic interactions, ultimately enhancing the catalytic activity. This study demonstrates that cation-engineered metalloporphyrins are a robust strategy for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, providing valuable guidance for ammonia synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Macrocyclization in Ahp&#8208;Bicyclodepsipeptides Biosynthesis Involves Cytochrome P450&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Aromatic Hydroxylation and C&#9472;N Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of Ahp&#8208;bicyclodepsipeptides featuring an N51&#8208;C15 bridge linking citrulline and tyrosine residues is reported. A single CYP450 enzyme, Dlm16, has been biochemically characterized to perform this intriguing macrocyclization through sequential aromatic hydroxylation and C&#9472;N coupling. The enzymatic C&#9472;H arene amidation mediated by Dlm16 involves a primary amide as the nitrogen donor and an aromatic ring as the acceptor.








Abstract
We report the biosynthesis of FR901277 (1) and delmomycin A2 (2), two 3&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypiperidone (Ahp)&#8208;containing bicyclodepsipeptides featuring an N&#8208;C bridge linking the citrulline and tyrosine residues. This intriguing side&#8208;chain macrocyclization is catalyzed by Dlm16, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450), through a sequential process initiated by ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of the tyrosine ring, followed by intramolecular C&#9472;N coupling between the resulting catechol moiety and the terminal NH2 of the ureido group. Structure&#8208;function analyses and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis confirmed the catalytic importance of identified key residues, enabling the proposal of plausible macrocyclization mechanisms. Functional characterization of eight additional Dlm16 homologs further revealed a CYP450 subfamily capable of catalyzing C&#9472;N bond formation, underscoring the prevalence of this unusual macrocyclization in cyclodepsipeptide biosynthesis. Our work highlights nature's strategies for macrocycle construction and provides another example of CYP450&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;N coupling via direct C&#9472;H functionalization.

         <title>Catalytic Non&#8208;Oxidative C&#8211;C Coupling of Benzene to Biphenyl Over Sub&#8208;Nanostructured Europium Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a sub&#8208;nanostructured europium hydride catalyst supported on MgO which enables direct benzene coupling to produce biphenyl under mild conditions (&#8804;&#160;150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic studies reveal that the crucial role of hydride species for C&#9472;H bond activation and C&#9472;C construction in the catalytic cycle, which is fundamentally different from the conventional aryl&#8211;aryl coupling routes. 








Abstract
Catalytic coupling of benzene to biphenyl through direct C&#9472;H bond activation and C&#9472;C bond construction represents an ideal, atom&#8208;economical strategy, offering a streamlined alternative to classical multi&#8208;step functionalization approaches, and thus has been a long&#8208;sought after goal. Herein, we report that such a pathway can be realized over a sub&#8208;nanostructured europium hydride (Eu&#8211;H) catalyst under mild condition. The Eu&#8211;H catalyst achieved a biphenyl production of 53.7&#160;mmol&#160;gEu&#8722;1 with a turnover number (TON) of 16.3 over 144&#160;h at 150&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydride species (H&#8722;) in Eu&#8211;H preferentially deprotonate benzene to form a [C6H5&#8211;Eu] intermediate, which subsequently undergoes nucleophilic attack on another benzene molecule, resulting in biphenyl formation and regeneration of the Eu&#8211;H species to complete the catalytic cycle. This work not only provides a strategy for benzene coupling to biphenyl but also demonstrates the promising role of hydrides in transforming arenes into value&#8208;added molecules.

         <title>Proton Alloying in an Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Material Enables Unusual Dynamic Birefringence and Martensitic Actuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we have successfully synthesized a novel hydrogen&#8208;proton alloyed organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, characterized by two distinct protonated Cyclen cations within its lattice. This unique structural paradigm gives rise to an asynchronous orientation mechanism, enabling outstanding martensitic phase transition and multimodal dynamic birefringence behaviors.








Abstract
Alloying is widely recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing or unlocking material properties by combining different elements. Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials (OIHMs) allow for chemical modification at the molecular level, bringing new opportunities and enormous potential to alloying strategies. Hydrogen protons in molecules are essential for structural design and crystal engineering, however, valuable role of proton alloying in OIHMs remains largely unexplored. Herein, for the first time, we present a proton alloying OIHM [Cyclen4+Cyclen2+]Sb2Cl12 (Cyclen&#8208;1D), which exhibits exceptional martensitic actuation behaviors, including jumping, bending and a significant raising effect with a large expansion up to 50%. Meanwhile, Cyclen&#8208;1D also possesses unusual multi&#8208;mode dynamic birefringence featuring continuous modulation and switching mutation, showing an excellent birefringence change (&#916;n&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.044). This interesting integration of mechanical and optical channels originates from the asynchronous orientations of distinct protonated Cyclen cations as well as cooperative transformation with inorganic octahedron through hydrogen bonding. This work reveals the great potential of proton alloying in OIHMs, opening new avenues for designing dynamically stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>From Lignocellulose to Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Innovative Synthesis through Friedel&#8211;Crafts Alkylation and Hydrodeoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aviation sector's reliance on fossil kerosene is a major source of CO2 emissions, while wood waste represents an abundant, renewable carbon resource that can help reduce its footprint. Hemicellulose and lignin are catalytically converted into kerosene&#8208;like naphthenes via Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and hydrodeoxygenation, enabling sustainable drop&#8208;in aviation fuels compatible with existing engines and infrastructure.








Abstract
To address the aviation sector's growing carbon footprint, this study presents a novel route for producing sustainable aviation fuel precursors via acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of wood&#8208;derived lignin monomers with furfuryl alcohol. Using guaiacol as a model compound, key catalytic requirements were investigated in batch mode. Although heterogeneous zeolites showed initial promise, pore blocking by oligomerized furfuryl alcohol limited performance, leading to the selection of para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid as an effective homogeneous catalyst. A fed&#8208;batch strategy was employed to suppress oligomerization by controlling furfuryl alcohol concentration. The resulting alkylated products, structurally aligned with conventional kerosene, were further upgraded via metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeoxygenation, achieving final overall yields up to 92 C%.

         <title>Enzyme Immobilization in Porous Crystals via Cage Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins have been immobilized in crystals by encapsulation in well&#8208;defined, spherical coordination cages prior to crystallization. This pre&#8208;encapsulation approach allows isomorphic crystallization of various types of proteins with high loading efficiency. Dual enzyme immobilization in the cage crystals resulted in enhanced cascade reaction activity due to close proximity.








Abstract
Enzyme immobilization within solid or polymer matrices continues to face challenges, such as inhomogeneous protein environments, low loading efficiency, and limited versatility. Here, we present a pre&#8208;encapsulation strategy for enzyme immobilization in porous crystals via coordination cage encapsulation. In this approach, enzymes are first confined within the well&#8208;defined cavities of spherical coordination cages prior to crystallization. The host cage framework facilitates crystal formation under almost uniform conditions, independently of the surface properties of the enzymes. This isomorphous crystallization enabled the successful immobilization of nine proteins with diverse sizes and properties, achieving high loading efficiencies. The immobilized enzymes retained their native structures and catalytic activities within the crystal, functioning as heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced stability. Furthermore, the co&#8208;immobilization of two enzymes in close proximity facilitated cascade reactions, underscoring the potential of coordination cages as effective hosts for enzyme immobilization.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Interface Reconstruction over Black Phosphorus Complex for Wide&#8208;Temperature and Fast&#8208;Charging Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BP nanospheres encapsulated within the hollow nanoreactor and aniline derivative (PBS) bearing the synergistic advantages of the multi&#8208;secondary bonds mediation have been conceptualized and designed to showcase high efficiency in potassium storage. This is attributed to the anion&#8208;aggregated solvation structure via Zn2+ and C4H9O&#8722;, rapid K+ transport highways via amphipathic ions and the redox medium of SO3H&#8722;. This design yields reconciled fast charging, wide&#8208;temperature operation, and long&#8208;term stability based on dynamic volume/kinetics compensation over IRSM strategy.








Abstract
Black phosphorus (BP), exhibiting a large spatial layer and high theoretical capacity, has been heralded as a promising candidate for K+ storage. Nevertheless, the unpredictability of the structural/interfacial reconstruction guides the arduous kinetics and poor stability, especially conferring to high current density and wide&#8208;temperature operation. To address these challenges, self&#8208;adaptive interface reconstruction with a multiple secondary bonds mediation (IRSM) strategy is adopted for amphipathic BP complex to improve kinetics and stability, wherein BP nanospheres encapsulated into a sacciform B&#8208;doped carbon matrix (BC) are further grafted with polybromoisobutyryloxy benzenesulfonic (PBBS), which undergoes in situ polymerization and is transformed into metal&#8208;organic bromoisobutyrylox supramolecular (PBS). Consequently, combining the flexibility/rigidity advantage of organic moiety and the stability advantage of inorganic moiety, BC@BP@PBS manifests excellent fast charging behaviors, a wide&#8208;temperature operation from &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C to 80&#160;&#176;C, and an extended cycle life of up to 1300 cycles. This work builds an ingenious protocol for leveraging the trade&#8208;off between fast charging, wide&#8208;temperature operation, and long life span for high&#8208;performance cell devices.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Automated Synthesis of Polysubstituted Gentisaldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CASP&#8208;guided retrosynthesis enabled streamlined construction of polysubstituted gentisaldehydes (PGAs) via automated flow 6&#8208;endo cyclization of cyclobutenedione and propargyl diacetal derivatives. DFT studies reveal diradical intermediates and 1,5&#8208;H transfer as key steps. Rapid and gram&#8208;scale PGA libraries highlight scalable and industrially relevant synthesis.








Abstract
Gentisaldehyde is a fundamental motif with broad applications in pharmaceuticals. However, the construction of such molecules is time&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive with low step efficiency. The development of a disruptive retrosynthetic method is therefore highly necessary to enhance ring&#8208;formation capability and reduce redundancy in synthetic strategies. Herein, guided by cutting&#8208;edge computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms, synthetic routes were systematically deduced toward polysubstituted gentisaldehydes (PGAs). An automated flow system was subsequently developed to implement the streamlined synthesis via selective 6&#8208;endo cyclization of cyclobutenedione derivatives and propargyl diacetal moieties. DFT computational studies further revealed the involvement of diradical intermediates, rather than the conventional zwitterionic mechanism, and identified the 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process as the key driving force. The rapid and collective construction of a gram&#8208;scale library of PGAs highlights the industrial potential for scalability and application. This work demonstrates the synergistic interplay among computational retrosynthetic analysis, mechanistic elucidation, and flow processing, establishing an innovative model for universally integrated molecule library construction.

         <dc:description>
Maxson and Szilv&#225;si use a machine&#8208;learned interatomic potential to model supported silver nanoparticles. They show that the idealized nanoparticle shapes commonly invoked in the computational catalysis literature do not reflect experiments for diameters below 8 nm and instead form an oblong shape of lower symmetry.








Abstract
The structure of metal nanoparticles is central to their catalytic activity, but metal&#8211;support interactions are difficult to model via quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations. Using a machine&#8208;learned potential to model supported silver nanoparticles, it has been shown that the idealized nanoparticle shapes commonly invoked in the literature do not reflect experiments for diameters below 8&#160;nm, as reported by Maxson and Szilv&#225;si.

         <title>Hyperbranched Oxime&#8208;Ester Covalent Adaptive Network for Recyclable Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric Epoxy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation&#8208;tunable dendrimer crosslinkers yield recyclable epoxy printed circuit board with ultralow dielectric constant/loss (2.02/0.005), excellent mechanical robustness and flame retardancy. By sterically restricting the dipolar relaxation losses of dynamic oxime&#8208;ester bonds and regulating free volume, the coral&#8208;like rigid hyperbranched topology reconciles the tradeoff between circularity and high&#8208;frequency performance in sustainable electronics.








Abstract
Epoxy thermosets are indispensable in high&#8208;frequency (5G/6G) electronics, but their permanent crosslinks hinder recyclability and worsen e&#8208;waste. Although covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer recyclability, their polar dynamic bonds exacerbate dielectric losses at gigahertz (GHz) bands due to dipolar relaxation. Here, we develop generation&#8208;tunable dendritic dynamic crosslinkers that yield recyclable epoxy&#8208;based printed circuit board (PCB) with ultralow dielectric performance. O&#8208;acylation reaction of a vanillin&#8208;derived tetrahedral aldoxime with phthalic anhydride affords precise control over generations, branching degree, and nanomorphology of the crosslinkers. This controlled synthesis yields porous coral&#8208;like architecture, which in turn produces graded&#8208;branched epoxy CANs with enhanced free volume and steric confinement. Within the rigid constrained topology, the network containing spherically distributed oxime&#8208;ester motifs exhibits restricted dipolar relaxation and achieves low dielectric loss in GHz bands, while remaining acid&#8208;cleavable for closed&#8208;loop recycling at 80&#160;&#176;C. The resulting PCB exhibits a record&#8208;low dielectric constant/loss (2.02/0.005@10&#160;GHz), 71.53% improved X&#8208;band impedance matching, a tensile strength of 256&#160;MPa, and V&#8208;0 flame retardancy, alongside a 98.9% reduction in ecotoxicity after recycling. This work demonstrates how precision dendrimer synthesis and topology regulation can reconcile the tradeoff between circularity and high&#8208;frequency performance in sustainable electronics.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Powered Signaling Between Artificial and Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce an ATP&#8208;powered artificial cell platform capable of selectively and transiently releasing DNA signals to facilitate communication between artificial and living cells. By engineering these DNA signals, we achieve precise activation of cellular functions and regulated delivery in response to ATP levels.








Abstract
ATP is the energy currency of life and is overabundant in the tumor microenvironment, where it has been suggested as a target for cancer therapy. We introduce ATP&#8208;dissipative delivery of DNA signals from artificial cells to living cells by exploiting an ATP&#8208;driven reaction network that transiently ejects DNA Signal strands from the shielded artificial cell interior to the extracellular medium of living cells. We customize the Signal for intracellular uptake or for extracellular instruction using a cytokine&#8208;ssDNA chimera that can trigger efficient intracellular downstream signaling programs. Our study discusses details of system design on a timer circuit and artificial cell level, system integration challenges, and how ATP concentrations regulate the transient delivery. The strategy can be extended to deliver therapeutic oligonucleotides for applications in gene therapy and gene silencing.

&lt;p&gt;We introduce an ATP-powered artificial cell platform capable of selectively and transiently releasing DNA signals to facilitate communication between artificial and living cells. By engineering these DNA signals, we achieve precise activation of cellular functions and regulated delivery in response to ATP levels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATP is the energy currency of life and is overabundant in the tumor microenvironment, where it has been suggested as a target for cancer therapy. We introduce ATP-dissipative delivery of DNA signals from artificial cells to living cells by exploiting an ATP-driven reaction network that transiently ejects DNA Signal strands from the shielded artificial cell interior to the extracellular medium of living cells. We customize the Signal for intracellular uptake or for extracellular instruction using a cytokine-ssDNA chimera that can trigger efficient intracellular downstream signaling programs. Our study discusses details of system design on a timer circuit and artificial cell level, system integration challenges, and how ATP concentrations regulate the transient delivery. The strategy can be extended to deliver therapeutic oligonucleotides for applications in gene therapy and gene silencing. For cancer therapy, it can use naturally enhanced ATP levels to induce selective delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Ultrarigid Chiral Styrenes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Unconventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Cyclization/Carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
Atroposelective synthesis of ultrastable chiral styrenes: An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;enynes to configurationally ultrastable axially chiral styrenes was reported for the first time. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating various nucleophiles, including alcohols, water, and amines, to access diverse axially chiral styrene&#8208;based esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. Mechanistic studies revealed an unexpected Pd&#8211;hydride&#8208;triggered 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway.








Abstract
Axially chiral styrenes represent a promising class of atropisomers with broad potential in asymmetric catalysis, drug discovery, and materials science. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains underdeveloped due to the conformational flexibility and inherently low rotational barriers. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;enynes that enables efficient access to a series of configurationally ultrastable axially chiral styrenes in good to high yields (up to 88%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.5/0.5&#160;er). Key to success is the strategic design of an ortho&#8208;alkyne&#8208;substituted styrene substrate that favors olefin&#8208;first Pd&#8211;hydride insertion, followed by unconventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization and carbonylation. This protocol exhibits broad nucleophile compatibility, including alcohols, water, and amines, enabling the modular synthesis of diverse chiral styrene&#8208;based esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. The resulting conformationally rigid product was further transformed into an axially chiral monophosphine ligand, which demonstrated high efficiency in asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic investigations support a Pd&#8211;hydride insertion&#8211;cyclization&#8211;carbonylation sequence. This transformation provides a powerful platform for the asymmetric synthesis and application of axially chiral styrenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Type II Porous Liquids from Nonporous Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra Enhanced by Host&#8211;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II porous liquids with record&#8208;high cage&#8208;content. This strategy synergistically increases the solubility of MOP&#8208;18 and prevents the interpenetration of n&#8208;dodecyl chains into cage cavities, enabling the transition MOP&#8208;18 from nonporous in the solid state to porous in the liquid state for gas separation.








Abstract
The synthesis of Type II porous liquids (PLs) from metal&#8211;organic polyhedra, a kind of excellent porous molecular sources, suffers from their strong crystallization tendency induced poor solubility. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II PLs from MOPs with record&#8208;high concentration. Benefitting from host&#8211;guest interactions between pillar[5]arene and n&#8208;alkyl chains, a Type II PL (P5&#8208;PL) is developed by dissolving apolar n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOP&#8208;18) in polar liquid pillar[5]arene (P5&#8208;L), exhibiting solubility much higher than all MOP&#8208;based Type II PLs reported to date. MOP&#8208;18, being nonporous in the solid state because of molecular packing&#8208;induced pore blockage, displays permanent molecular porosity when molecularly and randomly dispersed in P5&#8208;L to form P5&#8208;PL, as confirmed by experimental and simulation results. P5&#8208;PL demonstrates excellent CO2/N2 separation capabilities, enabling the fabrication of mixed matrix membrane with superior CO2/N2 selectivity. This strategy can be extended to the fabrication of additional Type II PLs, showing its universality. This synergistic design concept integrating supramolecular chemistry with PLs not only overcomes traditional tedious covalent modification but also enables high compatibility between apolar cage solutes and polar solvents, affording PLs with high porosity, low volatility and viscosity, and programmable tunability.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Photoluminescence Based on Functionalized Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) based on quantum dot&#8208;molecule hybrid materials is overviewed, including the principles for designing efficient TADPL, strategies for facile regulation of TADPL lifetimes, the advantages of TADPL over molecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence, and relevant photochemical applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising light&#8208;harvesting materials that offer advantages of high extinction coefficients and tunable absorption/emission wavelengths. However, the exciton lifetime, another key property of these materials, is relatively short (nanoseconds) and is challenging to manipulate. In recent years, the hybrid structures of QD surface&#8208;functionalized with organic molecules have emerged a versatile platform to regulate the exciton lifetime. Through rapid triplet energy transfer (TET) and thermally activated reverse TET (rTET) between the QD exciton and the molecular triplet, the exciton lifetime can be prolonged to sub&#8208;milliseconds with thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) that resembles thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in molecules. Reported TADPL systems thus far have successfully covered the spectral range from violet to near&#8208;infrared. This review introduces the principles for constructing efficient TADPL systems and identifies three strategies that allow for facile regulation of TADPL lifetimes. The advantages of TADPL systems over TADF molecules are also highlighted, which include a smaller Stokes shift and a narrower emission linewidth. Applications of TADPL systems in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation up&#8208;conversion and photochemical reactions are also reviewed, which are enabled by the substantial increase in exciton lifetime that facilitates efficient charge/energy transfer to substrate molecules via diffusion in solution. Finally, we summarize the current limitations of these materials and provide an outlook for future directions to be explored.

         <title>A Universal pH Regulation Principle for HER Suppression in Aqueous Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal electrolyte's pH value design principle is proposed to suppress the severe HER in aqueous metal batteries (AMBs). The value is correlated with the equilibrium between metal cations and their precipitation, validated in multiple systems (Zn/Mn/Mg). An integrated in situ EQCM&#8208;GC&#8208;EW platform is further developed to elucidate the pH&#8208;dependency of corrosive/catalytic&#8208;HER. Therefore, these fundamental insights guide the rational design of pH&#8208;stabilized electrolytes, effectively suppressing HER and enabling stable cycling of AMBs. 








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) pose a formidable challenge to rechargeable aqueous metal batteries (AMBs), causing flammable gas accumulation and interfacial instability. While conventional buffer&#8208;based electrolytes partially mitigate HERs, there lacks a rational pH regulation principle. Herein, we propose a universal pH regulation principle rooted in the equilibrium between soluble metal cations and their hydroxide precipitates, governed by the solubility product (Ksp). Moreover, an analytical platform is designed to quantify the pH&#8208;dependent HER kinetics and distinguish the corrosive and catalytic H2 production by decoupling the evolution of mass, hydrogen gas, and charge. Under this platform, we can identify the optimized pH values (herein, 5.40 in 1&#160;M Zn&#8208;based electrolytes) by adding a selective buffer to synchronously suppress both corrosive and catalytic&#8208;HERs, leading to evident enhancement of cycling stability. The universality of this principle is also demonstrated in other AMB systems with more serious HER, such as Mn and Mg metal batteries. A more than eightfold increase in cycling lifespan is achieved with tailored buffers in both Mn and Mg AMBs. This work highlights the essential role of pH in aqueous electrolytes and also establishes a thermodynamic foundation for pH optimization and HER mitigation.

A new class of substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand featuring a coordinating phosphinothioyl, &#8208;selenoyl, or &#8208;telluroyl pendant arm in addition to the typical &#951;5&#8208;mode is presented. The homoleptic divalent europocenes obtained from these are the first examples of organometallic probes for magnetic circular dichroism thermometry at cryogenic temperatures, attaining relative sensitivities of up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.7&#160;K with resolution as high as 0.003&#160;K.








Abstract
The development of novel materials based on lanthanide metallocenes remains a valuable endeavour, due to the synthetic accessibility, compositional tunability, and impressive magnetic and luminescent properties of this class of well&#8208;studied compounds. Europium(II) complexes are particularly interesting in this regard, given the relative stability, strong paramagnetism, and characteristic Laporte&#8208;allowed 5d&#8594;4f emission of this ion. In this study, we tap into the powerful class of phosphinocyclopentadienyl ligands to develop a novel family of potassium (bis(dimethylamino)phosphinochalcogenoyl)cyclopentadienides K[C5Me4(PCh(NMe2)2] of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, and explore their coordination chemistry with EuII. These ligands readily form homoleptic europocenes where the pendant phosphine chalcogenide arms also coordinate the europium center, and these are characterized via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorbance, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Characterization via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy reveals that these complexes act as extremely sensitive probes for MCD&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry, reaching relative thermal sensitivities up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&#8722;1 at cryogenic temperatures, with temperature uncertainties as low as 0.003&#160;K. These complexes represent the first examples of organometallic MCD thermometers, and their remarkable properties and interesting structures highlight the promise of this new class of ligands and the utility of the EuII ion in lanthanide&#8208;based functional materials research.

         <title>Isomeric &#928; Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Nitrogen Topologies for Integrated Gold Adsorption and Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric nitrogen&#8208;topology&#8208;guided &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz and v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Pz) are developed that integrate selective adsorption and efficient photoreduction of AuCl4&#8211;. The v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz shows higher Au3&#8314; uptake (2465 mg g&#8722;1), and both COFs achieve &gt;99% gold extraction under visible light, establishing a topology&#8208;directed paradigm for COF&#8208;based precious metal recovery.








Abstract
Gold recovery from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) presents a significant materials challenge, as conventional systems lack structural tunability, exhibit poor metal selectivity, and fail to integrate adsorption and photoreduction functionalities effectively. Herein, we present a topology&#8208;guided strategy based on two isomeric &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz and v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Pz), incorporating diazine (ortho&#8208;N) and pyrazine (para&#8208;N) units, respectively, for integrated gold adsorption and photoreduction. The nitrogen topology not only stabilizes the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone but also significantly modulates the frameworks&#8217; optoelectronic and redox properties. Notably, v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz exhibits a markedly higher Au3&#8314; adsorption capacity (2465&#160;versus 1854&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1), attributed to enhanced interfacial electron localization and directional charge transfer to Au3&#8314; centers. Both frameworks achieve over 99% gold extraction from real e&#8208;waste leachates under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Spectroscopic characterization and DFT analysis reveal that nitrogen topology governs metal coordination strength and electronic coupling, enabling precise Au&#8211;Cl bond activation. This work establishes a nitrogen&#8208;topology&#8208;directed design paradigm for light&#8208;driven, COF&#8208;based precious metal recovery systems.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastics into Carboxylic Acids for Biodegradable Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable surfactants have now been created from post&#8208;consumer waste HDPE. High conversion (&gt;80%) is maintained throughout all major process steps including pyrolysis, hydroformylation, and oxidation. The utility of the plastic&#8208;derived carboxylate surfactant is confirmed via critical micelle concentration, surface tension, and foaming measurements.








Abstract
This work outlines a process for producing high&#8208;purity (&gt;95%) carboxylate surfactants from post&#8208;consumer recycled high&#8208;density polyethylene (PCR&#8208;HDPE). The approach involves the thermal depolymerization of PCR&#8208;HDPE via pyrolysis, followed by fractional distillation to isolate C9&#8211;C14 olefins. These olefins undergo hydroformylation using cobalt carbonyl catalysts to generate aldehydes, which are subsequently oxidized to carboxylic acids using Pinnick oxidation under mild aqueous&#8208;phase conditions. Neutralization of the resulting carboxylic acids with sodium hydroxide produces plastic&#8208;derived carboxylate surfactants (PDCs) in the form of sodium carboxylates. Subsequent purification steps ensure surfactant&#8208;grade purity and enable accurate assessment of physicochemical properties. The resulting PDCs are evaluated for critical micelle concentration (CMC), foamability, surface tension reduction, and calcium ion tolerance, demonstrating competitive behavior with conventional anionic carboxylate surfactants. This route provides a sustainable alternative for surfactant production, reducing reliance on fossil&#8208;derived feedstocks and valorizing plastic waste streams through chemical upcycling.
