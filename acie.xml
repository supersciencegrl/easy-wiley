      <title>Impact of organic templates on the selective formation of zeolite oligomers</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolites are essential materials to industry due to their adsorption and catalytic properties. The best current approach to prepare a targeted zeolite still relies on trial and error&#8217;s synthetic procedures since a rational understanding of the impact of synthesis variables on the final structures is still missing. To discern the role of a variety of organic templates, we perform simulations of the early stages of condensation of silica oligomers by combining DFT, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Evans&#8208;Polanyi relationships and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We investigate an extended reaction path mechanism including 258 equilibrium reactions and 242 chemical species up to silica octamers, comparing the computed concentrations of Si oligomers with  29  SI NMR experimental data. The effect of the templating agent is linked to the modification of the intramolecular H&#8208;bond network in the growing oligomer, which produces higher concentration of 4&#8208;membered ring intermediates, precursors of the key double&#8208;four ring building blocks present on more than 39 known zeolite topologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Racemic Monomer&#8208;Based One&#8208;Handed Helical Polymer Recognizes Enantiomers through Auto&#8208;Evolution of Its Helical Handedness Excess</title>
      <dc:description>The homochirality of bio(macro)molecules is a vital feature in living systems definitely responsible for their sophisticated functions. Obviously, any bio&#8208; and synthetic polymers composed of racemic monomers will show no chiral functions. Herein, we report that a racemic monomer&#8208;based optically&#8208;inactive polyacetylene folds into a one&#8208;handed helix assisted by a nonracemic alcohol, which can separate various enantiomers as a chiral stationary phase in chromatography. The chiral&#8208;resolving power is virtually identical to that of the enantiopure monomer&#8208;based one&#8208;handed helical polyacetylene. Because of its unique static memory of the induced helicity, the original racemic polyacetylene expresses an &#8220;auto&#8208;evolution&#8221; of its helical handedness over time, and at the same time, chirality of the nonracemic alcohol is discriminated accompanied by successive enhancement of its optical purity enantioselectively adsorbed on the helical polyacetylene due to the &#8220;chiral filter effect&#8221; as directly monitored by NMR, which contributes to further enhancing the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;excess of the helical polyacetylene.</dc:description>

      <title>Acceptor Engineering for Optimized ROS Generation Facilitates Reprogramming Macrophages to M1 Phenotype in Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to an antitumor M1 phenotype by photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment for boosted cancer immunotherapy.&#160;However, it still remains unclear how the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from type I and II mechanisms relate to the corresponding macrophage polarization efficacy.&#160;In this contribution, we rationally design and synthesize three donor&#8208;acceptor structured photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;enhanced ROS generation. Their ROS&#8208;generating efficiencies can be adjusted by changing the acceptor, resulting in varied capabilities to activate macrophages. Surprisingly, we discover that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro&#8208;tumor type (M2) to an anti&#8208;tumor state (M1).&#160;  In vivo&#160;  experiments further prove that the AIEgen photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth in mice with a single PDT treatment, while the therapeutic outcome is significantly abolished in the mice with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the molecular designing guideline of macrophage&#8208;activatable photosensitizers and provides new insights into the working principle of macrophage activation in photodynamic immunotherapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Improving Overall Properties of Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials through Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>A major trade&#8208;off in the field of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of pure organic materials is that the large luminescence dissymmetry factor (  g  lum  ) usually give rise to the suppression of luminescence efficiency (  &#934;  PL  ). Here, a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled system, driven by arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and octafluoronaphthalene (  OFN  ), was firstly reported to provide a solution to this problem. Two kinds of chiral PAHs based on pyrene and anthracene could co&#8208;assemble with  OFN  in hybrid solvents to form long&#8208;range ordered AP assemblies. The detailed process of AP interaction driving self&#8208;assembly was verified by the morphological measurement and fluorescence spectra. The AP assemblies exhibited chirality amplification not only in the excited state but also in the ground state. In addition, the AP assemblies showed enhanced luminescence efficiency compared with the individual chiral PAHs due to the energy barrier effect of  OFN  . The present strategy based on AP interaction could be applied to boost the development of highly efficient CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Persistent Radical Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and their Application in Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of persistent radical metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a significant challenge that underpins the expansion of their functionalities. Herein, via an  in situ  solvothermal method, a series of stable radical 2D MOFs have been assembled. The existence of (  m  &#8208;TTFTB)  3  (  m  &#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;tetrabenzoate) trimer building blocks is beneficial for the stability of radicals due to delocalization of the unpaired electron. The presence of hexanuclear rare earth (RE) cluster&#8208;based infinite one&#8208;dimensional chains further enhances the stability of the frameworks. The radical state of the middle TTF in the trimer has been observed by the change of central C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bond distances and the configuration of the TTF by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The radical characteristics are also confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. Stability tests showed that these radials in the frameworks are stable even in non&#8208;aqueous/aqueous solutions and under acid/base environments (pH 1&#8208;12). Owing to the efficient light&#8208;absorption ability from intramolecular charge transfer, low thermal conductivity and outstanding stability, the radical 2D Dy&#8208;MOF shows excellent photothermal properties, an increase of 34.7 &#176;C within 240 seconds under one&#8208;sun illumination. The results demonstrate the stability of persistent radical MOFs by electron delocalization and their application in photothermal conversion, expanding their future applications in solar energy utilization, photothermal therapy, seawater desalination, photothermal catalysis and so on.</dc:description>

Owing to the efficient light&#8208;absorption ability from intramolecular charge transfer, low thermal conductivity and outstanding stability, the radical 2D Dy&#8208;MOF shows excellent photothermal properties, an increase of 34.7 &#176;C within 240 seconds under one&#8208;sun illumination. The results demonstrate the stability of persistent radical MOFs by electron delocalization and their application in photothermal conversion, expanding their future applications in solar energy utilization, photothermal therapy, seawater desalination, photothermal catalysis and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Thermally Activated n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors Achieved by N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene Based Dopant</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular doping plays an important role in the modification of carrier density of organic semiconductors thus enhancing their optoelectronic performance. However, efficient n&#8208;doping remains challenging, especially due to the lack of strongly reducing and air&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Herein, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor, DMImC, is developed as a thermally activated n&#8208;dopant with the excellent stability in air. Its thermolysis in situ regenerates free NHC and subsequently dopes typical organic semiconductors. In sequentially doped FBDPPV films, DMImC doesn&#8217;t disturb the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing of the polymer and achieves good miscibility with the polymer. As a result, a high electrical conductivity of up to 8.4 S cm&#8208;1 is obtained. Additionally, the thermally activated doping and the excellent air stability permit DMImC to be noninteractively co&#8208;processed with polymers in air. Our results reveal that DMImC can be served as an efficient n&#8208;dopant suitable for various organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <title>Coupling of Cu(100) and (110) Facets Promotes Carbon Dioxide Conversion to Hydrocarbons and Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>Copper can efficiently electro&#8208;catalyze carbon dioxide reduction to C2+ products (e.g., C2H4, C2H5OH, and n&#8208;propanol). However, the correlation between the activity and active sites remains ambiguous, impeding further improvements in their performance. This paper describes the facet effect of copper crystal to promote CO adsorption and C&#8208;C coupling and consequently yield a superior selectivity for C2+ products. We achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87% and a large partial current density of 217 mA cm&#8208;2 toward C2+ products on Cu(OH)2&#8208;D at only &#8208;0.54 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow&#8208;cell electrolyzer. With further coupled to a Si solar cell, record&#8208;high solar conversion efficiencies of 4.47% and 6.4% are achieved for C2H4 and C2+ products, respectively. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the selective formation of C2+ products on Cu and paves the way for the practical application of electrocatalytic or solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>A Biomimetic DNA&#8208;Based Membrane Gate for Protein&#8208;Controlled Transport of Cytotoxic Drugs</title>
      <dc:description>
DNA nanotechnology can be used to rationally design a molecular gate to control the transport of small&#8208;molecule drugs across bilayer membranes. The DNA pore with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer lid opens in the presence of thrombin to increase the transport of the cytotoxic drug topotecan by 330&#8208;fold. The nanodevice could be adapted for a range of different protein triggers with applications in biosensing, research, and biomedicine.







Abstract
Chemistry is ideally placed to replicate biomolecular structures with tuneable building materials. Of particular interest are molecular nanopores, which transport cargo across membranes, as in DNA sequencing. Advanced nanopores control transport in response to triggers, but this cannot be easily replicated with biogenic proteins. Here we use DNA nanotechnology to build a synthetic molecular gate that opens in response to a specific protein. The gate self&#8208;assembles from six DNA strands to form a bilayer&#8208;spanning pore, and a lid strand comprising a protein&#8208;binding DNA aptamer to block the channel entrance. Addition of the trigger protein, thrombin, selectively opens the gate and enables a 330&#8208;fold increase inw the transport rate of small&#8208;molecule cargo. The molecular gate incorporates in delivery vesicles to controllably release enclosed cytotoxic drugs and kill eukaryotic cells. The generically designed gate may be applied in biomedicine, biosensing or for building synthetic cells.

The gate self&#8208;assembles from six DNA strands to form a bilayer&#8208;spanning pore, and a lid strand comprising a protein&#8208;binding DNA aptamer to block the channel entrance. Addition of the trigger protein, thrombin, selectively opens the gate and enables a 330&#8208;fold increase inw the transport rate of small&#8208;molecule cargo. The molecular gate incorporates in delivery vesicles to controllably release enclosed cytotoxic drugs and kill eukaryotic cells. The generically designed gate may be applied in biomedicine, biosensing or for building synthetic cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Boronic Acids and the Thioimidate KAT Transfer Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>We report the synthesis of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of boronic acids and the thioimidate KAT transfer reagent. The combination of widely available aryl&#8208; and vinylboronic acids with commercially available thioimidate&#160;  1  &#160;using catalytic Pd  II  &#160; and a Cu  II  &#160;additive&#160; enables the preparation of KATs in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. This formal insertion of CO into organoboronic acids can also be applied to boronic acid pinacol esters and potassium organotrifluoroborates using a slightly modified procedure. The cross&#8208;coupling can be telescoped into the one&#8208;pot synthesis of amides and&#160; a &#8208;aminotrifluoroborates by exploiting the unique chemistry of KATs and their trifluoroborate iminium (TIM) derivatives.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Using 4&#8208;phenylpyridine or 2&#8208;phenylpyridine in place of biphenyl, two electron&#8208;poor phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused boroles,  [TipPBB1]  4  and  TipPBB2  were prepared.  [TipPBB1]  4  adopts a unique coordination mode and forms a tetramer with a cavity in both the solid state and solution. The boron center of  TipPBB2  is 4&#8208;coordinate in the solid state but the system dissociates in solution, leading to 3&#8208;coordinate borole species. Compared to its borafluorene analogues, the electron accepting ability of  TipPBB2  is largely enhanced by the pyridyl group.  TipPBB2  exhibits dual fluorescence in solution due to an equilibrium between free  TipPBB2  and a weak intermolecular coordination adduct with a second molecule. This equilibrium was further investigated by low temperature NMR and photophysical studies. Theoretical studies indicate that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of  TipPBB2  localizes at the Tip group, in contrast to its borafluorene derivatives wherein the HOMOs are localized on borafluorene cores.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Catalysts for Green Synthesis of Adipic Acid from Biomass</title>
      <dc:description>Green synthesis of adipic acid from renewable biomass is a very attractive goal of sustainable chemistry. Herein, we report efficient catalysts for a two&#8208;step transformation of cellulose&#8208;derived glucose into adipic acid via glucaric acid. Carbon nanotube&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles are found to work efficiently for the oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid. An activated carbon&#8208;supported bifunctional catalyst composed of rhenium oxide and palladium is discovered to be powerful for the removal of four hydroxyl groups in glucaric acid, affording adipic acid with a 99% yield. Rhenium oxide functions for the deoxygenation but is less efficient for four hydroxyl&#8208;group removal. The co&#8208;presence of palladium not only catalyzes the hydrogenation of olefin intermediates but also synergistically facilitates the deoxygenation. This work presents a green route for adipic acid synthesis, and offers a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis strategy for efficient deoxygenation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The reactivity of Ni(II) and Pd(II) olefin polymerization catalysts can be enhanced by introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the supporting ligands rendering the metal centers more electrophilic. Reported here is a comparison of ethylene polymerization activity of a classical salicyliminato nickel catalyst substituted with the powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium (trippy) group to its&#8217; &#8211;CF  3  analog. The trippy substituent is substantially more electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#963;  meta  = 0.63) than the trifluoromethyl group (&#963;  meta  = 0.43) which results in a ca. 8&#8208;fold increase in catalytic turnover frequency. An additional advantage of trippy is its&#8217; high steric bulk relative to the trifluoromethyl group. This feature results in a four&#8208;fold increase in polymer molecular weight due to enhanced retardation of chain transfer.

      <title>Electron Transfer Process in Mixed Valence Compounds with Low&#8208;lying Energy Bridge in Different Oxidation States</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, the mixed valent compounds with the iso&#8208;cyanidometal&#8208;ligand bridge in different oxidation states are used as models for the investigation of ET process. Thus, we synthesized and fully characterized a series of trimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with [Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe]  n+  (n = 2 &#8208; 4), in which the one&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  3+  ) and two&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  4+  ) compounds possess an isocyanidometal&#8208;bridge whose energy is respectively lower and slightly higher than the terminal metal centers energies. For the  N  4  +  compounds, the bridge&#8208;state (Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  III  &#8208;Fe  II  ) and mixed valence states (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  II  or Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) could be simultaneous observed on the IR time&#8208;scale, supported by the ground state Potential Energy Surface (PES) that indicates as the number of methyl groups of Cp increases the ET excited mixed valence state becomes more and more stable. Whereas, for the  N  4  +  compounds, as the donor becomes stronger the ET excited bridge state (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) becomes more and more stable, and even becomes ground state due to the strong electronic coupling between Fe and Ru. Our findings might be helpful for better understanding the ET process in nature and for the design of novel electron transfer materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, the mixed valent compounds with the iso&#8208;cyanidometal&#8208;ligand bridge in different oxidation states are used as models for the investigation of ET process. Thus, we synthesized and fully characterized a series of trimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with [Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe]  n+  (n = 2 &#8208; 4), in which the one&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  3+  ) and two&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  4+  ) compounds possess an isocyanidometal&#8208;bridge whose energy is respectively lower and slightly higher than the terminal metal centers energies. For the  N  4  +  compounds, the bridge&#8208;state (Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  III  &#8208;Fe  II  ) and mixed valence states (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  II  or Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) could be simultaneous observed on the IR time&#8208;scale, supported by the ground state Potential Energy Surface (PES) that indicates as the number of methyl groups of Cp increases the ET excited mixed valence state becomes more and more stable. Whereas, for the  N  4  +  compounds, as the donor becomes stronger the ET excited bridge state (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) becomes more and more stable, and even becomes ground state due to the strong electronic coupling between Fe and Ru. Our findings might be helpful for better understanding the ET process in nature and for the design of novel electron transfer materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Genetically Encoded and Biologically Produced All&#8208;DNA Nanomedicine Based on One&#8208;Pot Assembly of DNA Dendrimers for Targeted Gene Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;DNA nanomedicines have emerged as potential anti&#8208;tumor drugs. DNA nanotechnology provides all&#8208;DNA nanomedicines unlimited possibilities in controlling the diversification of size, shape, and loads of the therapeutic motifs. What&#8217;s more, as DNA is a biological polymer, it is possible to genetically encode and produce the all&#8208;DNA nanomedicines in living bacteria. Herein, DNA&#8208;dendrimer&#8208;based nanomedicines are designed to adapt to the biological production, which is constructed by the flexible 3&#8208;arm building blocks to enable a highly efficient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; DNA assembly. For the first time, a DNA nanomedicine, D4&#8208;3&#8208;As&#8208;DzSur, is successfully genetically encoded, biotechnological produced, and directly self&#8208;assembled. By the following  in vitro  and  in vivo  studies, the performance of the biologically produced D4&#8208;3&#8208;As&#8208;DzSur in targeted gene regulation has been confirmed. We conclude that, as an advantageous superiority, the biological production capability will fulfill the low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale production of all&#8208;DNA nanomedicines and promote their clinical applications in the future.</dc:description>

The resulting emitters exhibit the small singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#916;  E  ST  ) and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process.

Despite the chirality of monosaccharides, reports on the impact of stereochemistry in natural polysaccharides and synthetic carbohydrate polymers remain absent. Herein, we report the cocrystallization of regio&#8208; and stereoregular polyethers derived from D&#8208; and L&#8208;xylose, leading to enhanced thermal properties compared to the enantiopure polymers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a stereocomplex between carbohydrate polymers of opposite chirality.

      <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Magnesium Hybrid Full Batteries Enabled by Carrier&#8208;Hosting Potential Compensation&#8203;</title>
      <dc:description>Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from insufficient electrochemistry and low carrier&#8208;hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry with carrier&#8208;hosting potential compensation, high&#8208;energy Mg2+  /Na+  hybrid batteries are achieved. Typically, an unprecedented Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3(MVCP) cathode is coupled with FeVO4  (FVO) anode in a new aqueous/organic hybrid electrolyte, realizing a reliable high&#8208;voltage operation. This operation enables more sufficient (de)intercalation of hybrid carriers (Mg2+/Na+  ), thereby enhancing the reversible capacity remarkably (233.4 mA h g&#8722;1  at 0.5 A g&#8722;1  , 92.7 Wh kg&#8722;1  electrode  , i.e. 1.75&#8208;fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes). Simultaneously, resorting to the relatively high Na+  &#8208;hosting potential in electrodes, the low Mg  2+  &#8208;hosting potential flaw is well&#8208;compensated. This synergistically widens/elevates the discharge plateau of the full battery up to 1.50 V. After 1350 cycles at 1 A g  &#8722;1  , a low capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle is obtained, and the plateau is well retained.

      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom CoN  4  active sites have demonstrated excellent efficiency in peroxymonosulfate activation. However, the identification of CoN  4  active sites and the detailed singlet oxygen generation mechanism in peroxymonosulfate activation still remain ambiguous. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species by atomically dispersed cobalt anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. As assisted by experimental and DFT calculations, CoN  2+2  was the definite active sites. Singlet oxygen was the absolutely predominant reactive oxygen species that the proportion was 98.89%. Different from the traditional CoN  4  configuration, the CoN  2+2  active sites transformed the pathway of peroxymonosulfate activation and facilitated the singlet oxygen generation. Spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed peroxymonosulfate on Co single atoms was prevented due to the energy barriers caused by weak positive Co atoms and CoN  2+2  coordination, determining PMS oxidation in non&#8208;radical pathway and simultaneous singlet oxygen generation. The generated singlet oxygen showed efficient activity for degradation of several organic pollutants in a broad pH range.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclic &#960;&#8208;Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis and properties of anthracene&#8208;based cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters  1  and  2  , which possess two and four anthracene units, respectively, are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)&#8208;mediated reaction that afforded  1  as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face manner resulted in red&#8208;shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Cyclic &#960;&#8208;cluster  1  exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on  1  affords its photoisomer  1  &#8217; having C&#8211;C bonds that are longer than 1.65 &#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion to  1  under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of photoisomer  1  &#8217; (colorless) to  1  (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthesis and properties of anthracene&#8208;based cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters  1  and  2  , which possess two and four anthracene units, respectively, are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)&#8208;mediated reaction that afforded  1  as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face manner resulted in red&#8208;shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Cyclic &#960;&#8208;cluster  1  exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on  1  affords its photoisomer  1  &#8217; having C&#8211;C bonds that are longer than 1.65 &#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion to  1  under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of photoisomer  1  &#8217; (colorless) to  1  (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>4D&#8208;Printing of Photoswitchable Actuators</title>
      <dc:description>Shape&#8208;switching behavior, where a transient stimulus induces an indefinitely stable deformation that can be recovered on exposure to another transient stimulus, is critical to building smart structures from responsive polymers as continue power is not needed to maintain deformations. Here, we 4D&#8208;print shape&#8208;switching liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) functionalized with supramolecular crosslinks, dynamic covalent crosslinks and azobenzene. The salient property of shape&#8208;switching LCEs is that light induces long&#8208;lived, deformation that can be recovered on&#8208;demand by heating. UV&#8208;light isomerizes azobenzene from  trans  to  cis  , and temporarily breaks the supramolecular crosslinks, resulting in a programmed deformation. After UV, the shape&#8208;switching LCEs fix more than 90% of the deformation over 3 days by the reformed supramolecular crosslinks. Using the shape&#8208;switching properties, we print Braille&#8208;like actuators that can be photoswitched to display different letters. This new class of photoswitchable actuators may impact applications such as deployable devices where continuous application of power is impractical.</dc:description>

      <title>Kinetic Limitations in Single&#8208;Crystal High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;nickel cathodes attract immense interest for use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, to boost Li&#8208;storage capacity while reducing cost. For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the electrochemical kinetics of electrodes. We report here a quantitative assessment of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.8O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC) &#8208; being sluggish at low SOC while increasing rapidly as SOC increases both in the bulk electrode and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode. With the elucidated mechanistic origin and alleviation solution of kinetic limitations in single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;Ni cathodes, this work constitutes a step forward in enabling their practical deployment.</dc:description>

      <title>An ER&#8208;Targeting Iridium(III) Complex which Induces Immunogenic Cell Death in Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a vital component of therapeutically induced anti&#8208;tumor immunity. An iridium(III) complex (  Ir1  ), containing an  N  ,  N  &#8208;bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)&#8208;azane derivate, as an endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;localized ICD inducer for non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is herein reported. The characteristic discharge of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), i.e. cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT), extracellular exclusion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and ATP, were generated by  Ir1  in A549 lung cancer cells, accompanied by an increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The vaccination of immunocompetent mice with  Ir1  &#8208;treated dying cells elicited an antitumor CD8  +  T cell response and Foxp3  +  T cell depletion, which eventually resulted in long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;tumor immunity by the activation of ICD in lung cancer cells. With the dual actions of ICD and chemotherapy against NSCLC,  Ir1  has great potential as an antitumor agent. To the best of our knowledge,  Ir1  is the first iridium&#8208;based complex that is capable of developing an immunomodulatory response by immunogenic cell death.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Graphene oxide/PtNPs/Fe2O3&#8220;dual&#8208;propelled&#8221; catalytic and fuel&#8208;free rotary actuated magnetic Janus micromotors modified with the antimicrobial peptide Nisin are used for highly selective capture/inactivation of gram&#8208;positive bacteria units and biofilms.

The high stability of Nisin along with the high towing force of the micromotors allow for efficient micromotor operation in untreated raw media (tap water, juice and serum) and even in blood and in flowing blood in magnetic mode. The high selectivity of the approach is illustrated by the dramatically lower interaction with gram&#8208;negative bacteria (Escherichia Coli). The double&#8208;propulsion (catalytic or fuel&#8208;free magnetic) mode of the micromotors and the high biocompatibility holds considerable promise to design micromotors with tailored lanbiotics that can response to the changes that make the bacteria resistant in a myriad of clinical, environmental remediation or food safety applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailored Catalytic Nanoframes from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Anisotropic Surface Modification and Etching</title>
      <dc:description>The rational design and synthesis of frame&#8208;like hollow structures with unique three&#8208;dimensional open architectures for their diverse applications is still challenging. We herein propose a facile anisotropic surface modification and etching strategy for the synthesis of hollow structured ZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. Our strategy relies on the structural and compositional distinctions between each crystallographic facet of truncated rhombic dodecahedrons ZIF&#8208;67 (tZIF&#8208;67 RDs) and the moderate coordinating and etching effects of cyanuric acid (CA). Thereby, the CA can anisotropically modify and protect the {110} facets from etching, causing the six {100} facets be selectively etched via an inside&#8208;out manner, and finally forming the hollow nanoframes. Interestingly, the surface modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 RDs can further be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts via an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. After calcination in reducing atmosphere, the metal&#8208;tZIF&#8208;67 hydrids are converted into metal&#8208;Co alloy/C composite catalysts with hollow nanoframed structures. Among them, the PtCo/C catalyst with only 5.9 wt.% Pt exhibits high catalytic activities and stabilities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions, outperforming the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Our results offer insight into the development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with compositional and structural multiplicity, which in turn could encourages more practical catalytic applications.</dc:description>

Interestingly, the surface modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 RDs can further be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts via an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. After calcination in reducing atmosphere, the metal&#8208;tZIF&#8208;67 hydrids are converted into metal&#8208;Co alloy/C composite catalysts with hollow nanoframed structures. Among them, the PtCo/C catalyst with only 5.9 wt.% Pt exhibits high catalytic activities and stabilities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions, outperforming the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Our results offer insight into the development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with compositional and structural multiplicity, which in turn could encourages more practical catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rational Construction of Borromean Linked Crystalline Organic Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Attributed to the unique topological complexity and elegant beauty, Borromean systems are attracting intense attention.

To address this formidable challenge, we developed a supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to fabricate Borromean linked organic polymer. The solvothermal condensation reaction of a judiciously selected trigonal pyramidal building block, 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantane, with linear dialdehyde building blocks allowed the construction of two rare covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity and robustness. Structure refinement unveiled the successful formation of entangled 2D&#10137;2D Borromean arrayed structures. Both the two COFs were of microporosity and thus demonstrated the potentials for gas separation. The successful synthesis of the first two Borromean linked organic polymers paves the avenue to expand the supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to other building blocks and topologies, and broadens the family and scope of COFs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Enantiopure secondary alcohols are fundamental high&#8208;value synthetic building blocks. One of the most attractive ways to get access to this compound class is the catalytic hydroboration. We describe a new concept for this reaction type which allowed for exceptional catalytic turnover numbers (up to 15400), which were increased by around 1.5&#8208;3 orders of magnitude compared to the most active catalysts previously reported.

      <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Dankasterones A and B and Periconiastone A Through Radical Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>We describe herein the assembly of the  cis  &#8208;decalin framework through radical cyclization initiated by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT), further applied it in the asymmetric synthesis of dankasterones A and B and periconiastone A. Position&#8208;selective C&#8722;H oxygenation allowed for installation of the necessary functionality. A radical rearrangement was adopted to create 13(14&#8594;8)  abeo  &#8208;8&#8208;ergostane skeleton. Interconversion of dankasterone B and periconiastone A was realized through biomimetic intramolecular aldol and retro&#8208;aldol reactions. The MHAT&#8208;based approach, serves as a new dissection means, is complementary to the conventional ways to establish  cis  &#8208;decalin framework.</dc:description>

      <title>Activation of Aptamers with Gain&#8208;of&#8208;Function by Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Clipping of Intramolecular Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>Click reactions, which are commonly used in the challenging task of biology&#8208;oriented modular conjugation, have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility, and they accelerate the generation of molecules possessing well&#8208;de&#64257;ned functions. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers,&#8221; whose binding affinity is regulated by the "clip"&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de novo selection of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; can achieve the efficient transition from a binding inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results proved that the &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Observing single&#8208;atom catalytic sites during reactions with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have become a prominent theme in heterogeneous catalysis, not least because of the potential fundamental insight into active sites. The desired level of understanding, however, is prohibited due to the inhomogeneity of most supported SACs and the lack of suitable tools for structure&#8208;activity correlation studies with atomic resolution. Herein, we describe the potency of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) to study molecularly defined SACs supported on polyoxometalates in catalytic reactions. We were able to identify the exact composition of active sites and their evolution in the catalytic cycle during CO and alcohol oxidation reactions performed in the liquid phase. Critical information on metal&#8208;dependent reaction mechanisms, the key intermediates, the dynamics of active sites and even the stepwise activation barriers were obtained, which would be challenging to gather via prevailingly adopted techniques in SAC research. DFT calculations revealed intricate details of the reaction mechanisms, and strong synergies between ESI&#8208;MS defined SAC sites and electronic structure theory calculations become apparent.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing the Similarities of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Iminiums and Acylazoliums in Organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The secondary amine&#8208;catalyzed reactions proceeding via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed transformations taking place via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums are the two widely used electrophilic intermediates in organocatalysis. Over the last two decades, these two intermediates are extensively utilized for the enantioselective construction of valuable molecules. Both intermediates are generated by the covalent binding of catalysts to the substrates leading to LUMO activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls.&#160; A variety of soft nucleophiles are known to add to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums in a conjugate fashion, and in many cases, striking similarity in reactivity has been observed. Having said this, there are few cases where these intermediates exhibit difference in reactivity. This Minireview is aimed at highlighting the resemblances in reactivity between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminium and acylazolium intermediates thereby shedding light on the unnoticed parallels of the two intermediates in organocatalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Environmental Control of Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Evolution and Conductance. Case Study of Expanded Pyridinium Wiring.</title>
      <dc:description>Environmental control of single molecule junction evolution and conductance was demonstrated for expanded pyridinium molecules by scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction method and interpreted by quantum transport calculations including solvent molecules explicitly. Fully extended and highly conducting molecular junctions prevail in water environment as opposed to short and less conducting junctions formed in non&#8208;solvating mesitylene. Theoretical approach correctly models single molecule conductance values considering the experimental junction length. Most pronounced difference in the molecular junction formation and conductance was identified for a molecule with the highest stabilization energy on the gold substrate confirming the importance of molecule&#8208;electrode interactions. Presented concept of tuning conductance through molecule&#8208;electrode interactions in the solvent&#8208;driven junctions can be used in the development of new molecular electronic devices.</dc:description>
