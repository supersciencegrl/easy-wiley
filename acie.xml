         <title>Efficient Amino&#8208;Sulfhydryl Stapling on Peptides and Proteins Using Bifunctional NHS&#8208;Activated Acrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated esters stand among the most used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox. Here, we describe a rational design of NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides for the efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides allow for a fast functionalization of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (k2 = 1.54 &#177; 0.18 x 103 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) under dilute aqueous conditions, enabling selectivity over other nucleophilic amino acids. Additionally, the versatility of these new bioconjugation handles was demonstrated in the cross&#8208;linking of in&#8208;chain or C&#8208;terminal cysteines with nearby lysine residues. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides are compatible with the use of other cysteine selective reagents, allowing for orthogonal dual&#8208;modifications. This strategy was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins with a PEG unit, fluorescent probe, and cytotoxic agent. The level of molecular control offered by NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides is expected to promote the amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling technology as a powerful strategy to design functional bioconjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Traceless Removal of Two Kernel Atoms in A Gold Nanocluster and Its Impact on Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removing or adding kernel atoms of metal nanoclusters (NCs) without leaving a trace is a substantial challenge because the kernel atoms are inside and covered by the outer staples. However, such kernel tuning is very important for improving the properties and acquiring an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kernel&#8208;property correlation.  Photoluminescence  (PL) is one of the most intriguing characteristics of metal NCs but has not been well understood until now. Inspired by these challenges/questions, we conducted this study and, for the first time, achieved the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in a gold nanocluster by applying a simple thermal treatment and revealed its impact on PL. Further, we demonstrated that the kernel Au&#8208;Au bond length can be an indicator for a comparison of the PL or kernel charge state between nanoclusters with similar kernel structures and sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>A TADF emitter featuring linearly arranged spiro&#8208;donor and spiro&#8208;acceptor groups for highly efficient non&#8208;doped and doped deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a molecular design strategy of deep&#8208;blue emitters for resolving the lack of highly efficient deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring CIE  y  (Commission Internationale de l&#180;Eclairage) color coordinates matching the display requirements (&lt;0.1). The strategy is to combine weak spiro&#8208;donor and spiro&#8208;acceptor groups into a linear donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type of thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence molecule through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer. The strategy endows an emitter with deep blue emission, a narrower emission bandwidth (51 nm in toluene), a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY: 0.95 in toluene), weak concentration quenching and efficient triplet&#8208;exciton utilization, which are all attractive characters for the emitters of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with lower CIE  y  coordinates. Owing to the rational design, the emitter has realized not only highly efficient doped deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 25.4% and CIE  y  &lt; 0.1 but also so far the most efficient non&#8208;doped deep&#8208;blue OLED (EQE up to 22.5%) with CIE  y  &lt; 0.1.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Production of HCOOH from CO2 Electroreduction via Bi/CeOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO  2  electroreduction. However, most of the catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction to HCOOH in aqueous solution often suffer from low curkrent density and limited production rate. Herein, we provide a bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeO  x  ) catalyst, which exhibits not only robust current density (105 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  ), but also unprecedented production rate (2600 &#956;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;cm  &#8208;2  ) with high Faradaic efficiency (FE, 92%) for HCOOH generation in aqueous media. Furthermore, Bi/CeO  x  also shows favorable stability over 34 h. We hope this work could offer an attractive and promising strategy to develop efficient catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction with superior activity and desirable stability.Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO  2  electroreduction.

         <title>Deciphering the supramolecular organization of multiple guests inside a microporous MOF to understand their release profile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) give the opportunity of confining guest molecules into their pores even by a post&#8208;synthetic protocol.  PUM168  is a Zn&#8208;based MOF characterized by microporous cavities that allows the encapsulation of a significant number of guest molecules. The pores engineered with different binding sites show a remarkable guest affinity towards a series of natural essential oils components, such as eugenol, thymol and carvacrol, relevant for environmental applications. Exploiting single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, it was possible to step&#8208;wisely monitor the rather complex three&#8208;components guest exchange process involving dimethylformamide (DMF, the pristine solvent) and binary mixtures of the flavoring agents. A picture of the structural evolution of the DMF&#8208;to&#8208;guest replacement occurring inside the MOF crystal was reached by a detailed single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal monitoring. The relation of the supramolecular arrangement in the pores with selective guests release was then investigated as a function of time and temperature by static headspace GC&#8208;MS analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive helical motion by light&#8208;driven molecular motors in a liquid crystal network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling sophisticated motion by molecular motors is a major goal on the road to future actuators and soft robotics. Taking inspiration from biological motility and mechanical functions common to artificial machines, responsive small molecules have been used to achieve macroscopic effects, however, translating molecular movement along length scales to precisely defined linear, twisting and rotary motions remain particularly challenging. Here, we present the design, synthesis and functioning of liquid&#8208;crystal network (LCN) materials with intrinsic rotary motors that allow the conversion of light energy into reversible helical motion. In this responsive system the photochemical &#8211;driven molecular motor has a dual function operating both as chiral dopant and unidirectional rotor amplifying molecular motion into a controlled and reversible left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed macroscopic twisting movement. By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single motor embedded in an LC&#8208;network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Synthesized from Thermal Transformation and Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanoparticles converted into single atoms bring about a significant improvement in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a 95.7&#8201;% faradic efficiency for CO production.







Abstract
We report an Ag1 single&#8208;atom catalyst (Ag1/MnO2), which was synthesized from thermal transformation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and surface reconstruction of MnO2. The evolution process of Ag NPs to single atoms is firstly revealed by various techniques, including in&#8197;situ ETEM, in&#8197;situ XRD and DFT calculations. The temperature&#8208;induced surface reconstruction process from the MnO2 (211) to (310) lattice plane is critical to firmly confine the existing surface of Ag single atoms; that is, the thermal treatment and surface reconstruction of MnO2 is the driving force for the formation of single Ag atoms. The as&#8208;obtained Ag1/MnO2 achieved 95.7&#8201;% Faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). DFT calculations indicated single Ag sites possessed high electronic density close to Fermi Level and could act exclusively as the active sites in the CO2RR. As a result, the Ag1/MnO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable performance for the CO2RR, far surpassing the conventional Ag nanosized catalyst (AgNP/MnO2) and other reported Ag&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycarboxylate Rhodium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) and their use as Building Blocks for Highly Connected Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different post&#8208;synthetic routes have been followed to functionalize pre&#8208;synthesized RhII&#8208;based cuboctahedral metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with carboxylic acid groups, either on their 12&#8197;metal sites (vertices) or on their 24&#8197;linkers (edges). Such isolated MOPs serve as highly connected (12&#8208;c and 24&#8208;c) supermolecular building blocks, for the formation of two new bimetallic RhCu&#8208;MOF structures.







Abstract
Use of preformed metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored due to lack of robust functionalized MOPs. Herein we report the use of polycarboxylate cuboctahedral RhII&#8208;MOPs for constructing highly&#8208;connected MOFs. Cuboctahedral MOPs were functionalized with carboxylic acid groups on their 12 vertices or 24 edges through coordinative or covalent post&#8208;synthetic routes, respectively. We then used each isolated polycarboxylate RhII&#8208;MOP as 12&#8208;c cuboctahedral or 24&#8208;c rhombicuboctahedral SBBs that, upon linkage with metallic secondary building units (SBUs), afford bimetallic highly&#8208;connected MOFs. The assembly of a pre&#8208;synthesized 12&#8208;c SBB with a 4&#8208;c paddle&#8208;wheel SBU, and a 24&#8208;c SBB with a 3&#8208;c triangular CuII SBU gave rise to bimetallic MOFs having ftw (4,12)&#8208;c or rht (3,24)&#8208;c topologies, respectively.

         <title>Donor/Acceptor Pairs Created by Electrostatic Interaction: Design, Synthesis, and Investigation on the Exciplex Formed Within the Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor/acceptor pairs are created by electrostatic interaction between an anionic donor and a cationic acceptor, which afford an isolated exciplex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence in a diluted film. Interactions between donor and acceptor are changed by varying the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the acceptor. The pairs show mechanochromic luminescence in the solid state and promising performances in light&#8208;emitting devices.







Abstract
Exciplexes formed between donors and acceptors have been widely explored but isolating them from each other and tuning the interaction between the donor and acceptor have remained challenges. Here, we report donor/acceptor (D/A) pairs created by electrostatic interaction between a carbazole&#8208;based anionic donor and a 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;based cationic acceptor and the exciplex formed within the pair. In a diluted film, the D/A pair affords an isolated exciplex which shows thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By changing the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the cationic acceptor, interactions between the donor and acceptor can be changed. Compared to the conventional exciplex formed in a neat film, the isolated exciplex exhibits a substantially higher luminescence efficiency. The D/A pairs show intriguing mechanochromic luminescence and mechanical grinding&#8208;induced/reinforced TADF in the solid state and promising performances as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Frameworks Assembled through Outer&#8208;Surface Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the outer&#8208;surface interactions of cucurbit[n]urils (OSIQ) in various simple cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) and QSFs assembled via self&#8208;induced OSIQ, anion&#8208;induced OSIQs, and aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQs. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties establishes a new research direction in cucurbit[n]uril chemistry.







Abstract
Porous materials, especially metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and supramolecular organic frameworks, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) suitable building units for porous materials because they possess cavities with neutral electrostatic potential, portal carbonyls with negative electrostatic potential, and outer surfaces with positive electrostatic potential, which may result in the formation of Q[n]&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) assembled through the interaction of guests within Q[n]s, the coordination of Q[n]s with metal ions, and outer&#8208;surface interaction of Q[n]s (OSIQ). This review summarizes the various QSFs assembled via OSIQs. The QSFs can be classified as being assembled by 1)&#8197;self&#8208;induced OSIQ, 2)&#8197;anion&#8208;induced OSIQ, and 3)&#8197;aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQ. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties may establish a new research direction in Q[n] chemistry.

         <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous small&#8208;angle scattering measurements accurately and quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of counterions around a rigid, spherical charged cluster {Mo132}42&#8722;, which reveal the secret behind the unusual high solubility of {Mo132} with divalent counterions in comparison to the monovalent ones.







Abstract
The accurate distribution of countercations (Rb+ and Sr2+) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo132}42&#8722;, is determined by anomalous small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Both Rb+ and Sr2+ ions lead to shorter diffuse lengths for {Mo132} than prediction. Most Rb+ ions are closely associated with {Mo132} by staying near the skeleton of {Mo132} or in the Stern layer, whereas more Sr2+ ions loosely associate with {Mo132} in the diffuse layer. The stronger affinity of Rb+ ions towards {Mo132} than that of Sr2+ ions explains the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration of {Mo132} with Rb+ compared to Sr2+. The anomalous behavior of {Mo132} can be attributed to majority of negative charges being located at the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8211;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction, making the enthalpy change owing to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8211;{Mo132} interaction.

&lt;p&gt;Anomalous small&#8208;angle scattering measurements accurately and quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of counterions around a rigid, spherical charged cluster {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;42&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which reveal the secret behind the unusual high solubility of {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} with divalent counterions in comparison to the monovalent ones.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accurate distribution of countercations (Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;42&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, is determined by anomalous small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Both Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions lead to shorter diffuse lengths for {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} than prediction. Most Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are closely associated with {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} by staying near the skeleton of {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} or in the Stern layer, whereas more Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions loosely associate with {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} in the diffuse layer. The stronger affinity of Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions towards {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} than that of Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions explains the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration of {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} with Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; compared to Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The anomalous behavior of {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} can be attributed to majority of negative charges being located at the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8211;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction, making the enthalpy change owing to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8211;{Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Adsorbed Intermediates via Axial Traction for the Promoted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An axial traction strategy is presented to reduce the energy barrier of the dynamic activation process over the M&#8208;N4 structure for boosting CO2RR activity.







Abstract
Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (M&#8208;N4) to accelerate overall reaction dynamics of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of the M&#8208;N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C). The Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90&#8201;% in a wide range of potential window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O active moiety composed of a Ni&#8208;N4 site with an additional oxygen atom that induces an axial traction effect.

         <title>Photocatalysis Enhanced by External Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, external electric field, magnetic field, and coupled multiple fields, provide an effective and facile strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy by means of photocatalysis shows huge potential to relieve the ongoing energy crisis and increasing environmental pollution. However, unsatisfactory conversion efficiency still hinders its practical application. The introduction of external fields can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors from the inside out. This review focuses on recent advances in the application of diverse external fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, electric field, magnetic field, and coupled fields, to boost photocatalytic reactions, for applications in, for example, contaminant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and bacterial inactivation. The relevant reinforcement mechanisms of photoabsorption, the transport and separation of photoinduced charges, and adsorption of reagents by the external fields are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and outlook for the development of external&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced photocatalysis are presented.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Borylation of Unbiased Methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds at the Position &#946; to a Nitrogen Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbiased methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at the position &#946; to a nitrogen center were borylated in an enantioselective manner in the presence of a catalytic amount of a chiral bidentate boryl ligand and an iridium precursor (see scheme). The method tolerated a broad spectrum of functional groups to furnish a variety of C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalized products in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Reported herein is the pyrazole&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective borylation of unbiased methylene C&#8722;H bonds at the position &#946; to a nitrogen center. The combination of a chiral bidentate boryl ligand, iridium precursor, and pyrazole directing group was responsible for the high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity observed. The method tolerated a vast array of functional groups to afford the corresponding C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization products with good to excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Regioselective and Redox&#8208;Neutral Cp*IrIII&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic C&#8722;H Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium Allyl Pair! Herein, we describe a Cp*IrIII&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective and redox&#8208;neutral alkynylation of unactivated olefins with bromoalkynes via allylic C&#8722;H activation. This undirected C&#8722;H functionalization outperformed other typically used directing groups, including ketone, ester and strongly coordinating oxime.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Cp*IrIII&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective and redox&#8208;neutral protocol for the construction of 1,4&#8208;enynes from unactivated olefins and bromoalkynes via intermolecular allylic C&#8722;H alkynylation. The developed mild reaction conditions tolerate a broad range of common functional groups, even enabling selective alkynylation of allylic C&#8722;H bonds in the presence of other prominent directing groups. Mechanistic experiments including the isolation of a catalytically active IrIII&#8208;allyl species support an intermolecular allylic C&#8722;H activation followed by an electrophilic alkynylation.

         <title>Spectroscopic Verification of Adsorbed Hydroxy Intermediates in the Bifunctional Mechanism of the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HOR on Au@PtNi surfaces in alkaline media has been investigated by in&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (see picture). Direct spectroscopic evidence for OHad species was observed and further confirmed by deuterium isotopic experiments and DFT.







Abstract
Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells. However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism owing to a lack of direct in situ evidence of intermediates. In this study, in situ electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and DFT were used to study HOR processes on PtNi alloy and Pt surfaces, respectively. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxy species (OHad) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OHad species were not observed on the Pt surface during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxy adsorption on the platinum&#8208;alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxy adsorption. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.

         <title>Targeted Delivery of Persulfides to the Gut: Effects on the Microbiome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The persulfide donor NDP&#8208;NAC (see structure) was synthesized and found to decompose in response to E.&#8197;coli nitroreductase with the release of N&#8208;acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC&#8208;SSH). NDP&#8208;NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice by the upregulation of beneficial small&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain fatty acids, by increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium, and by decreasing populations of pathogenic Synergistales bacteria.







Abstract
Persulfides (R&#8722;SSH) have been hypothesized as potent redox modulators and signaling compounds. Reported herein is the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo evaluation of a persulfide donor that releases N&#8208;acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC&#8208;SSH) in response to the prokaryote&#8208;specific enzyme nitroreductase. The donor, termed NDP&#8208;NAC, decomposed in response to E.&#8197;coli nitroreductase, resulting in release of NAC&#8208;SSH. NDP&#8208;NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice that were not observed in animals treated with control compounds incapable of persulfide release or in animals treated with Na2S. NDP&#8208;NAC induced these effects by the upregulation of beneficial small&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain fatty acids and through increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium. It also decreased the populations of Synergistales bacteria, opportunistic pathogens implicated in gastrointestinal infections. This study reveals the possibility of maintaining gut health or treating microbiome&#8208;related diseases by the targeted delivery of reactive sulfur species.

         <title>Formation Mechanisms for Phosphorene and SnIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorene, the mono layer material of the element allotrope black phosphorus (P  black  ) and SnIP are 2D and 1D semiconductors with intriguing physical properties. Both gained tremendous interest due to their application potential in electronic, optical and sensor applications. P  black  and SnIP have in common that they can be synthesized via short way transport or mineralization using tin, tin(IV) iodide and amorphous red phosphorus. This top&#8208;down approach is the most important access route to phosphorene today. The two preparation routes are closely connected and differ mainly in reaction temperature and molar ratios of starting materials. Many speculative intermediates or activator side phase have been announced especially for top&#8208;down P  black  /phosphorene synthesis, like Hittorf&#8217;s phosphorus or Sn  24  P  19.3  I  8  clathrate. The importance of phosphorus&#8208;based 2D and 1D materials for energy conversion, storage, and catalysis inspired us to elucidate the formation mechanisms of these two compounds. Here, we report on the reaction mechanisms of P  black  /phosphorene and SnIP from P  4  and SnI  2  via direct gas phase formation.</dc:description>

         <title>cis&#8208;Quinacridone&#8208;Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters: Seemingly Old but Renewed Functional Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a material design of linear  cis  &#8208;quinacridone (  cis  &#8208;QA) derivatives as delayed fluorescence luminogens. In contrast to the widely studied traditional  trans  &#8208;isomers, the functionality of  cis  &#8208;QA and its derivatives remains unexplored and unclarified. Through combined computational and experimental investigations, we revealed that unprecedented  cis  &#8208;QA derivatives can function as fascinating narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best&#8208;performing deep&#8208;blue OLEDs incorporating these  cis  &#8208;QA luminogens achieved high external electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of up to 19.0% and high color purity with chromaticity coordinates of (0.13, 0.14).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Missing Linker Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled cages have been widely studied owing to their architectural aesthetics and diverse potential applications. Archimedean and Platonic structures are typically observed for these assemblies, but nonclassical architectures such as defective cages with missing edges/vertices are scarcely observed. We present here the controlled synthesis of defective coordination cages by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of the assembled metal ions. Three chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derived bis&#8208;tridentate ligands  L  1  &#8211;  L  3  with pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamides (pcam) chelating moieties are therefore designed and synthesized, among which  L  3  has a smaller steric hindrance on the coordinating sites relative to the other two linkers. Complexes of  L  1  and  L  2  with lanthanides affords the irregular Ln  8  (  L  1  )  10  hexahedra with two missing edges and Ln  4  (  L  2  )  5  tetrahedra with one missing edge, respectively, both of which contain a 1:1 mixture of Ln(pcam)  2  and Ln(pcam)  3  . In contrast, complex of  L  3  produce the regular twisted Ln  6  (  L  3  )  9  trigonal prisms without missing edges that contain only Ln(pcam)  3  vertices. The defective cage, especially the hexahedral cage featuring two missing linkers has more freedom to adjust its structural conformation, affording adaptable cavity to accommodate a range of guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals, such as anthracene, perylene, fullerene C  60  , BODIPY and leucocrystal violet, that are less accessible to the regular cage.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;dimensional fabrication of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into multi&#8208;level channels integrated devices are highly demanded for Li&#8208;S separators owing to their advantages in pore&#8208;engineering that might fulfill requirements like intercepting the diffusing polysulfides and improving the Li  +  /electrolyte transfer in Li&#8208;S battery. However, most of reported works focus on the roles of MOFs as ionic&#8208;sieves towards polysulfides while having limited investigation on the tuning of Li  +  transfer across the separators. Here, a photo&#8208;induced heat&#8208;assisted processing strategy has been proposed to fabricate MOFs into multi&#8208;dimensional devices (e.g., hollow/Janus fiber, double/triple&#8208;layer membranes). Specifically, for the first time, a kind of triple&#8208;layer separator with stepped&#8208;channels has been designed and served as powerful separator with outstanding specific capacity (1365.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) and cycling&#8208;performance (0.03% fading per cycle from 100  th  to 700  th  cycle), superior to single/double&#8208;layer and commercial separators. This work proposed might expedite the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes and extend the scope of MOFs in energy&#8208;storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Single molecule counting coupled to rapid amplification enables detection of &#945;Synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein aggregation is a hallmark of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and a promising biomarker for early detection and assessment of disease progression. The prospect of a molecular test for Parkinson&#8217;s disease is materializing with the recent developments of detection methods based on amplification of synuclein seeds (e.g. RT&#8208;QuIC or PMCA). These methods have shown promising results and identifies synucleinopathies from a variety of biofluids. However, those experiments are often very long (days) and rely on precise experimental parameters. Here we adapted single molecule counting methods for the detection of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein aggregates in cerebro&#8208;spinal fluid (CSF). This technique is performed in solution, using the approved and well&#8208;described amyloid reagent thioflavin T and a dedicated device with minimal user input. Single molecule methods enable to probe the early events in the amplification process used in RT&#8208;QuIC and a precise counting of ThT&#8208;positive aggregates. The measurements are fast (min) and show very good sensitivity, down to attograms of Synuclein aggregates when coupled with a single short, isothermal amplification step. Importantly, the use of single molecule counting also allows a refined characterization of the samples and fingerprinting of the protein aggregates present in CSF of patients. The fingerprinting of size and ThT reactivity of each individual aggregate shows a unique signature for each PD patients compared to controls and may provide new insights on synucleinopathies in the future.</dc:description>

The measurements are fast (min) and show very good sensitivity, down to attograms of Synuclein aggregates when coupled with a single short, isothermal amplification step. Importantly, the use of single molecule counting also allows a refined characterization of the samples and fingerprinting of the protein aggregates present in CSF of patients. The fingerprinting of size and ThT reactivity of each individual aggregate shows a unique signature for each PD patients compared to controls and may provide new insights on synucleinopathies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided Discovery of a Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;active Inhibitor of SETDB1 Tudor Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SET domain bifurcated protein 1 (SETDB1) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the silencing of some tumour suppressor genes and is overexpressed in many cancers. SETDB1 contains a unique tandem tudor domain (TTD) that recognizes histone H3 sequences containing both methylated and acetylated lysines. Beginning with the identification of a hit compound (  Cpd1  ), we discovered the first potent and selective small molecule SETDB1&#8208;TTD inhibitor  (R,R)&#8208;59  through stepwise structure&#8208;guided optimization.  (R,R)&#8208;59  showed a K  D  value of 0.088 &#177; 0.045 &#956;M in the ITC assay. The high potency of  (R,R)&#8208;59  was well explained by the cocrystal structure of the  (R,R)&#8208;59  &#8208;TTD complex.  (R,R)&#8208;59  is an endogenous binder competitive inhibitor. Evidence has also demonstrated its cellular target engagement. Interestingly, the enantiomer  (S,S)&#8208;59  did not show activity in all the assays, highlighting the potential of  (R,R)&#8208;59  as a tool compound in exploring the biological functions of SETDB1&#8208;TTD.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters confined within hierarchical porous carbons with high oxidation activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) have shown great promise for a variety of catalytic reactions. However, the fabrication of stable metal SNCs simultaneously with high dispersion and high metal contents still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel and versatile strategy for the synthesis of various bimetal SNCs stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). This facile synthesis only involves the self&#8208;assembly of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, a molten salt assisted pyrolysis process and the final metal replacement. The metal SNCs (mostly less than 0.8 nm) derived from the metal nodes of the MOF are exclusively confined and homogeneously dispersed throughout the organic ligands derived HPC at high loadings (up to 11.2 wt%). The obtained Cu&#8208;Pd@HPC composite exhibits superior catalytic activity and recycling durability in the selective transformation of furfural to maleic acid, achieving 97.8% yield of maleic acid with a TOF value as high as 20.1 h&#8722;1 under mild conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduction of Pd shifts the partial density of states of Cu toward the Fermi level, leading to stronger chemisorption of furfural to enhance the catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Electric Coupling in a Cobalt(II)&#8208;Based Spin Triangle Revealed by Electric Field&#8208;Modulated ESR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a cobalt(II)&#8208;based spin triangle showing a significant spin&#8208;electric coupling. The studied trinuclear complex [Co  3  (pytag)(py)  6  Cl  3  ]ClO  4  &#8729;3py, based on the tritopic ligand H  2  pytag (1,2,3&#8208;tris[(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylidene)amino]guanidine), crystallizes in the acentric monoclinic space group  P2  1  . In analogy with a previously investigated modification, the intra&#8208;triangle antiferromagnetic interaction, of the order of  ca.  &#8722;15 cm  &#8722;1  (  H  = &#8722;  J&#8239;S  a  S  b  ), leads to spin frustration. The two expected energy degenerate ground doublets are, however, separated by a few wavenumbers, as a consequence of magnetic anisotropy and deviations from threefold symmetry. At variance with the previously investigated modification, the Co  3  planes of symmetry&#8208;related molecules are almost parallel, allowing for the determination of the spin&#8208;electric properties on single crystals by electric field&#8208;modulated electron spin resonance spectroscopy (EFM&#8208;ESR). The spin&#8208;electric effect detected when the electric field is applied in the Co  3  plane was revealed by a shift in the resonance field. It was quantified as &#916;  g  E  /  E  = 0.11&#8729;10  &#8722;9  m&#8239;/&#8239;V, which in terms of frequency corresponds to &#8764; 0.3 Hz&#8239;m&#8239;/&#8239;V. This value is comparable to what was determined for a Cu  3  triangle despite the antiferromagnetic interaction being 20 times larger for the latter.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ligand Selection Strategy Identifies Chemical Probes Targeting the Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the ligand space allows to rapidly customize chemical probes for efficacy and active site specificity for a protease of interest. The application of this ligand selection approach is exemplified by generating probes for the two non&#8208;homologous yet essential proteases of the new corona virus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 providing complementary chemical tools for proteomic labeling and inhibitor discovery.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes are valuable tools for chemical biology. However, finding probes that specifically target the active site of an enzyme remains a challenging task. Herein, we present a ligand selection strategy that allows to rapidly tailor electrophilic probes to a target of choice and showcase its application for the two cysteine proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as proof of concept. The resulting probes were specific for the active site labeling of 3CLpro and PLpro with sufficient selectivity in a live cell model as well as in the background of a native human proteome. Exploiting the probes as tools for competitive profiling of a natural product library identified salvianolic acid derivatives as promising 3CLpro inhibitors. We anticipate that our ligand selection strategy will be useful to rapidly develop customized probes and discover inhibitors for a wide range of target proteins also beyond corona virus proteases.

The formation of exceptionally large capsular species (diameter of c. a. 30&#8197;&#197;) by interactions of polyphenolic macrocycles with 5&#8208;fold symmetry with anions is reported. Pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes interact with anions via hydrogen bonds involving phenolic OH groups or aromatic CH groups.

Abstract
The paper reports formation of exceptionally large capsular species (diameter of c. a. 30&#8197;&#197;) by interactions of polyphenolic macrocycles with 5&#8208;fold symmetry with anions. Pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes interact with anions via hydrogen bonds involving phenolic OH groups or aromatic CH groups. Based on NMR titration experiments, diffusion coefficients, and geometric requirements, it is postulated that the capsules have (P5H)12(X&#8722;)60 or (R5H)12(X&#8722;)60 stoichiometry and a unique geometry of one of the Platonic solids&#8212;a dodecahedron. The capsules exist in THF and in benzene, but not in chloroform, reflecting competitive effects in the solvation of anions. It is also demonstrated that mechanochemical pre&#8208;treatment (dry&#8208;milling) of solid samples is indispensable to initialize self&#8208;assembly in benzene.

         <title>Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors is described through the hybridization of natural sulfopeptides produced by blood feeding organisms. The hybrid sulfopeptides were rapidly assembled using peptide ligation chemistry and shown to exhibit femtomolar inhibition constants against thrombin. A lead inhibitor also showed potent inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro, as well as antithrombotic effects in a murine model.







Abstract
Blood feeding arthropods, such as leeches, ticks, flies and mosquitoes, provide a privileged source of peptidic anticoagulant molecules. These primarily operate through inhibition of the central coagulation protease thrombin by binding to the active site and either exosite I or exosite II. Herein, we describe the rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors that simultaneously block both exosites as well as the active site. These engineered hybrids were synthesized using tandem diselenide&#8208;selenoester ligation (DSL) and native chemical ligation (NCL) reactions in one&#8208;pot. The most potent trivalent inhibitors possessed femtomolar inhibition constants against &#945;&#8208;thrombin and were selective over related coagulation proteases. A lead hybrid inhibitor possessed potent anticoagulant activity, blockade of both thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro and efficacy in a murine thrombosis model at 1&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The rational engineering approach described here lays the foundation for the development of potent and selective inhibitors for a range of other enzymatic targets that possess multiple sites for the disruption of protein&#8211;protein interactions, in addition to an active site.

         <title>Reactivity and Mechanisms of Photoactivated Heterometallic [RuIINiII] and [RuIINiIIRuII] Catalysts for Dihydrogen Generation from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new heterometallic photocatalysts were probed for water reduction. While the bimetallic [RuIINiII] requires an external photosensitizer to be catalytic, the trinuclear heterometallic [RuIINiIIRuII] produces dihydrogen when irradiated with blue light. Mechanisms are proposed to account for these observations.







Abstract
Two heterometallic photocatalysts were designed and probed for water reduction. Both [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L1)](ClO4)2 (1) and [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L2)2RuII(bpy)2](ClO4)2 (2) can generate the low&#8208;valent precursor involved in hydride formation prior to dihydrogen generation. However, while the bimetallic [RuIINiII] (1) requires the presence of an external photosensitizer to trigger catalytic activity, the trimetallic [RuIINiIIRuII] (2) displays significant coupling between the catalytic and light&#8208;harvesting units to promote intramolecular multielectron transfer and perform photocatalysis at the Ni center. A concerted experimental and theoretical effort proposes mechanisms to explain why 1 is unable to achieve self&#8208;supported catalysis, while 2 is fully photocatalytic.

         <title>Bismuth Amides Mediate Facile and Highly Selective Pn&#8211;Pn Radical&#8208;Coupling Reactions (Pn=N, P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of bismuth amides of type [Bi(NAr2)3] has been synthesized and characterized. Remarkably, they readily release aminyl radicals (NAr2). and facilitate highly selective radical coupling to give (NAr2)2. Bismuth amides mediate the selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 (Pn=N, P, As), including very challenging substrates. Conditions, mechanisms, and substrate scopes are complementary or superior to those of more established procedures.







Abstract
The controlled release of well&#8208;defined radical species under mild conditions for subsequent use in selective reactions is an important and challenging task in synthetic chemistry. We show here that simple bismuth amide species [Bi(NAr2)3] readily release aminyl radicals [NAr2]. at ambient temperature in solution. These reactions yield the corresponding hydrazines, Ar2N&#8722;NAr2, as a result of highly selective N&#8722;N coupling. The exploitation of facile homolytic Bi&#8722;Pn bond cleavage for Pn&#8722;Pn bond formation was extended to higher homologues of the pnictogens (Pn=N&#8211;As): homoleptic bismuth amides mediate the highly selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 to give R2Pn&#8722;PnR2. Analyses by NMR and EPR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and DFT calculations reveal low Bi&#8722;N homolytic bond&#8208;dissociation energies, suggest radical coupling in the coordination sphere of bismuth, and reveal electronic and steric parameters as effective tools to control these reactions.

         <title>Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage Using Electrodeposited Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH4+ storage using electrodeposited manganese oxides (MnOx) is studied for the first time. MnOx exhibits structural transformation during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion in layered MnOx is associated with hydrogen&#8208;bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers.







Abstract
NH4+ ions as charge carriers show potential for aqueous rechargeable batteries. Studied here for the first time is the NH4+&#8208;storage chemistry using electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx experiences morphology and phase transformations during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+ storage for MnOx. The transformed MnOx with a layered structure delivers a high specific capacity (176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and exhibits good cycling stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M NH4Ac, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hosting materials. Experimental results suggest a solid&#8208;solution behavior associated with NH4+ migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations show that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by hydrogen&#8208;bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers. These findings provide a new prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+&#8208;based energy storage and contributes to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+&#8208;storage mechanism for metal oxides.

Cyanation results in a significant enhancement of the electron affinity in comparison to the fluorinated analogue, and the material demonstrates promising n&#8208;type performance in solution processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors with excellent stability.







Abstract
Reported here is a new high electron affinity acceptor end group for organic semiconductors, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT). An n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and TCNBT end groups was synthesized by a sixfold nucleophilic substitution with cyanide on a fluorinated precursor, itself prepared by a direct arylation approach. This one&#8208;step chemical modification significantly impacted the molecular properties: the fluorinated precursor, TFBT IDT, a poor ambipolar semiconductor, was converted into TCNBT IDT, a good n&#8208;type semiconductor. The electron&#8208;deficient end group TCNBT dramatically decreased the energy of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) compared to the fluorinated analogue and improved the molecular orientation when utilized in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Solution&#8208;processed OFETs based on TCNBT IDT exhibited a charge&#8208;carrier mobility of up to &#956;e&#8776;0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with excellent ambient stability for 100&#8197;hours, highlighting the benefits of the cyanated end group and the synthetic approach.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Casbane Diterpenes: One Strategy, Multiple Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cornucopia: Sessile soft corals as well as certain higher plants produce a multitude of casbane diterpenes with different oxygenation patterns. A new synthetic approach to this family of natural products (see structural framework) was designed that allows a large subset to be encompassed, yet is short, efficient, and selective. Key to success was a combination of catalytic cyclopropanation, alkyne metathesis, and trans&#8208;hydrometalation chemistry.







Abstract
Of the more than 100 casbane diterpenes known to date, only the eponymous parent hydrocarbon casbene itself has ever been targeted by chemical synthesis. Outlined herein is a conceptually new approach that brings not a single but a variety of casbane derivatives into reach, especially the more highly oxygenated and arguably more relevant members of this family. The key design elements are a catalyst&#8208;controlled intramolecular cyclopropanation with or without subsequent equilibration, chain extension of the resulting stereoisomeric cyclopropane building blocks by chemoselective hydroboration/cross&#8208;coupling, and the efficient closure of the strained macrobicyclic framework by ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis. A hydroxy&#8208;directed catalytic trans&#8208;hydrostannation allows for late&#8208;stage diversity. These virtues are manifested in the concise total syntheses of depressin, yuexiandajisu&#8197;A, and ent&#8208;pekinenin&#8197;C. The last compound turned out to be identical to euphorhylonal&#8197;A, the structure of which had clearly been misassigned.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Selective siRNA Delivery Using Glycosylated Dynamic Covalent Polymers Self&#8208;Assembled In&#8197;Situ by RNA Templating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymers are expressed at low concentration by siRNA templating from peptide&#8208;based dynamic covalent libraries. Using a glycosylated building block, we show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent libraries enable exploring complex chemical systems from which bioactive assemblies can adaptively emerge through template effects. In this work, we studied dynamic covalent libraries made of complementary bifunctional cationic peptides, yielding a diversity of species from macrocycles to polymers. Although polymers are typically expressed only at high concentration, we found that siRNA acts as a template in the formation of dynamic covalent polymers at low concentration in a process guided by electrostatic binding. Using a glycosylated building block, we were able to show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 3D COFs with interpenetrated open frameworks were synthesized from tetrahedral tetraamine and enantiopure BINOL dialdehydes. The resulting 3D COF was capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective under confinement effect in catalyzing important organic transformation with high catalytic activity and good recyclability.







Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;defined porous channels are shown to be capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations. By condensations of a tetrahedral tetraamine and two linear dialdehydes derived from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthol (BINOL), two chiral 3D COFs with a 9&#8208;fold or 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid framework are prepared. Enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non&#8208;immobilized acids. This facilitates the Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones. DFT calculations show the COF catalyst provides preferential secondary interactions between the substrate and framework to induce enantioselectivities that are not achievable in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Seven&#8208;Step Synthesis of All&#8208;Nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concise synthesis of all&#8208;nitrogenated sugar derivatives was achieved in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The sequential Overman rearrangement enabled formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in the monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs were available by the same synthetic route starting from different carbohydrates. Transformation and biological activities of ANS derivatives were also reported.







Abstract
All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi&#8208;amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.

&lt;p&gt;Concise synthesis of all&#8208;nitrogenated sugar derivatives was achieved in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The sequential Overman rearrangement enabled formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in the monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs were available by the same synthetic route starting from different carbohydrates. Transformation and biological activities of ANS derivatives were also reported.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi&#8208;amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals is reported. The system imparts consistently high stereoselectivity for the interception of a wide variety of radicals, including highly reactive primary radicals. The protocol also serves to develop radical cascade processes leading to stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general iminium ion&#8208;based catalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals. The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalytic platform is demonstrated by the stereoselective interception of a wide variety of radicals, including non&#8208;stabilized primary ones which are generally difficult to engage in asymmetric processes. The system also served to develop organocatalytic cascade reactions that combine an iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;based radical trap with an enamine&#8208;mediated step, affording stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.

         <title>Photocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance H2 Production: Ga&#8208;Doped Polymeric Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalyst, Ga&#8208;doped carbon nitride (CN), with an H2 production rate at 9900&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, is prepared by a one&#8208;step calcination. Ga exists in the GaN4 form on CN, and serves as the H2 production center. The excited electron prefers the GaN4 site, which adsorbs the proton in the excited state and tends to desorption of H* in the ground state, thus enhancing the H2 production.







Abstract
A photocatalyst system is generally comprises a catalyst and cocatalyst to achieve light absorption, electron&#8208;hole separation, and surface reaction. It is a challenge to develop a single photocatalyst having all functions so as to lower the efficiency loss. Herein, the active GaN4 site is integrated into a polymeric carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst (GCN), which displays an excellent H2 production rate of 9904&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. It is 162 and 3.3 times higher than that of CN with the absence (61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and presence (2981&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1), respectively, of 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt. Under light irradiation the electron is injected and stored at the GaN4 site, where the LUMO locates. The HOMO distributes on the aromatic ring resulting in spatial charge separation. Transient photovoltage discloses the electron&#8208;storage capability of GCN. The negative GaN4 promotes proton adsorption in the excited state. The positive adsorption energy drives H2 desorption from GaN4 after passing the electron to the proton. This work opens up opportunities for exploring a novel catalyst for H2 production.

         <title>Biomimetic Amino Acid Functionalized Phenazine Flow Batteries with Long Lifetime at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of amino acid functionalized phenazines for AORFB negolytes have been synthesized and studied. The 3,3&#8242;&#8208;(phenazine&#8208;1,6&#8208;diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6&#8208;DPAP) full cell against a ferrocyanide posolyte with 1.0&#8197;M electron concentration has an OCV of 1.15&#8197;V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5&#8201;% per year.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are a promising electrochemical technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. We report a biomimetic, ultra&#8208;stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP). A series of AFPs with various commercial amino acids at different substituted positions were synthesized and studied. 1,6&#8208;AFPs display much higher stability during cycling when compared to 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;AFPs. Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6&#8208;AFPs possess ultra&#8208;high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states. By pairing 3,3&#8242;&#8208;(phenazine&#8208;1,6&#8208;diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6&#8208;DPAP) with ferrocyanide at pH&#8197;8 with 1.0&#8197;M electron concentration, this flow battery exhibits an OCV of 1.15&#8197;V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5&#8201;% per year. These results show the importance of molecular engineering of redox&#8208;active organics for robust redox&#8208;flow batteries.

         <title>Coupling of Reformatsky Reagents with Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines were tailored to fit the requirements of room&#8208;temperature Negishi couplings of aryl chlorides. YPhos/Pd catalyst is highly efficient for the coupling with aryl chlorides in general, and the reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility. This allows the selective coupling of aryl electrophiles in the competitive reaction as demonstrated in the synthesis of ibuprofen.







Abstract
The coupling of aryl chlorides with Reformatsky reagents is a desirable strategy for the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl esters but has so far been substantially limited in the substrate scope due to many challenges posed by various possible side reactions. This limitation has now been overcome by the tailoring of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines to fit the requirements of Negishi couplings. Record&#8208;setting activities were achieved in palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylations of organozinc reagents with aryl electrophiles using a cyclohexyl&#8208;YPhos ligand bearing an ortho&#8208;tolyl&#8208;substituent in the backbone. This highly electron&#8208;rich, bulky ligand enables the use of aryl chlorides in room temperature couplings of Reformatsky reagents. The reaction scope covers diversely functionalized arylacetic and arylpropionic acid derivatives. Aryl bromides and chlorides can be converted selectively over triflate electrophiles, which permits consecutive coupling strategies.

Abstract
The entry of enveloped virus requires the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. An effective fusion inhibitor aiming at impeding such membrane fusion may emerge as a broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral agent against a wide range of viral infections. Mycobacterium survives inside the phagosome by inhibiting phagosome&#8211;lysosome fusion with the help of a coat protein coronin&#8197;1. Structural analysis of coronin&#8197;1 and other WD40&#8208;repeat protein suggest that the trp&#8208;asp (WD) sequence is placed at distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif (more exposed) in coronin&#8197;1. The unique structural feature of coronin&#8197;1 was explored to identify a simple lipo&#8208;peptide sequence (myr&#8208;WD), which effectively inhibits membrane fusion by modulating the interfacial order, water penetration, and surface potential. The mycobacterium inspired lipo&#8208;dipeptide was successfully tested to combat type&#8197;1 influenza virus (H1N1) and murine coronavirus infections as a potential broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral agent.

         <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Aluminum Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly rechargeable aqueous aluminum&#8208;organic battery system based on phenazine has been developed. The phenazine cathode undergoes a reversible electrochemical redox with high structural stability to accommodate the large&#8208;size aluminum&#8208;complex ions (de)insertion, and shows a strikingly stable aluminum storage capacity for promising large&#8208;scale energy applications.







Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AABs) are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, and the current reported cathodes for AABs mainly focused on inorganic materials which usually implement a typical Al3+ ions (de)insertion mechanism. However, the strong electrostatic forces between Al3+ and the host materials usually lead to sluggish kinetics, poor reversibility and inferior cycling stability. Herein, we employ an organic compound with redox&#8208;active moieties, phenazine (PZ), as the cathode material in AABs. Different from conventional inorganic materials confined by limited lattice spacing and rigid structure, the flexible organic molecules allow a large&#8208;size Al&#8208;complex co&#8208;intercalation through reversible redox active centers (&#8208;C=N&#8208;) of PZ. This co&#8208;intercalation behavior can effectively reduce desolvation penalty, and substantially lower the Coulombic repulsion during the ion (de)insertion process. Consequently, this organic cathode exhibits a high capacity and excellent cyclability, which exceeds those of most reported electrode materials for AABs. This work highlights the anion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry of redox&#8208;active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion battery systems.

         <title>Anionic Polymerization in Porous Organic Frameworks: A Strategy to Fabricate Anchored Polymers and Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic frameworks provide the suitable hydrocarbon cavities for anionic polymerization and copolymerization of isoprene and methylmethacrylate, forming core&#8211;shell nanostructured materials. Lithiation reaction on the frameworks generated multiple anion initiators which promoted the growth of anchored chains.







Abstract
An anionic mechanism is used to create polymers and copolymers as confined to, or anchored to, high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous nanoparticles. Linear polymers with soft and glassy chains, such as polyisoprene and polymethylmethacrylate, were produced by confined anionic polymerization in 3D networks of porous aromatic frameworks. Alternatively, multiple anions were generated on the designed frameworks which bear removal protons at selected positions, and initiate chain propagation, resulting in chains covalently connected to the 3D network. Such growth can continue outside the pores to produce polymer&#8208;matrix nanoparticles coated with anchored chains. Sequential reactions were promoted by the living character of this anionic propagation, yielding nanoparticles that were covered by a second polymer anchored by anionic block copolymerization. The intimacy of the matrix and the grown&#8208;in polymers was demonstrated by magnetization transfer across the interfaces in 2D 1H&#8208;13C&#8208;HETCOR NMR spectra.

A cation/anion co&#8208;alloying strategy is applied to prepare Zn0.4Cu0.7In1.0SxSe2&#8722;x (ZCISSe) quinary alloyed quantum dots (QDs). The band gap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states of the QDs can be conveniently tailored through composition engineering. The quinary alloyed QDs deliver a new certified efficiency record of 14.4&#8201;% for quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;sensitized solar cells.







Abstract
The photoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) have a critical impact on the performance of quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Currently, I&#8208;III&#8208;VI group QDs have become the mainstream light&#8208;harvesting materials in high&#8208;performance QDSCs. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve satisfactory efficiency for light&#8208;harvesting, charge extraction, and charge collection simultaneously in QDSCs. We design and prepare Zn0.4Cu0.7In1.0SxSe2&#8722;x (ZCISSe) quinary alloyed QDs by cation/anion co&#8208;alloying strategy. The critical photoelectronic properties of target QDs, including band gap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states, can be conveniently tailored. Experimental results demonstrate that the ZCISSe quinary alloyed QDs can achieve an ideal balance among light&#8208;harvesting, photogenerated electron extraction, and charge&#8208;collection efficiencies in QDSCs compared to its single anion or cation quaternary alloyed QD counterparts. Consequently, the quinary alloyed QDs boost the certified efficiency of QDSCs to 14.4&#8201;%, which is a new efficiency record for liquid&#8208;junction QD solar cells.

         <title>Searching for Monomeric Nickel Tetrafluoride: Unravelling Infrared Matrix Isolation Spectra of Higher Nickel Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular NiF3 and NiF4 are the missing tri&#8208; and tetrafluorides of the otherwise known binary first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal fluorides that are predicted to be stable. These elusive high&#8208;valent molecular nickel fluorides were identified in rare&#8208;gas matrices aided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical electronic structure calculations. They are among the most powerful known fluorination and oxidation agents.







Abstract
Binary transition metal fluorides are textbook examples combining complex electronic features with most fundamental molecular structures. High&#8208;valent nickel fluorides are among the strongest known fluorinating and oxidizing agents, but there is a lack of experimental structural and spectroscopic investigations on molecular NiF3 or NiF4. Apart from their demanding synthesis, also their quantum&#8208;chemical description is difficult due to their open shell nature and low&#8208;lying excited electronic states. Distorted tetrahedral NiF4 (D2d) and trigonal planar NiF3 (D3h) molecules were produced by thermal evaporation and laser ablation of nickel atoms in a fluorine/noble gas mixture and spectroscopically identified by a joint matrix&#8208;isolation and quantum&#8208;chemical study. Their vibrational band positions provide detailed insights into their molecular structures.

Artificial bipyridine&#8208;containing peptide ligands encode in their sequence the stereoselective folding into chiral three&#8208;stranded FeII or CoII peptide helicates and as kinetically inert dinuclear CoIII complexes by in&#8208;situ oxidation. These peptide helicates selectively label DNA replication foci in functional cells.







Abstract
Although largely overlooked in peptide engineering, coordination chemistry offers a new set of interactions that opens unexplored design opportunities for developing complex molecular structures. In this context, we report new artificial peptide ligands that fold into chiral helicates in the presence of labile metal ions such as FeII and CoII. Heterochiral &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;promoting sequences encode the stereoselective folding of the peptide ligands and define the physicochemical properties of their corresponding metal complexes. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy in combination with computational methods allowed us to identify and determine the structure of two isochiral &#923;&#923;&#8208;helicates, folded as topological isomers. Finally, in addition to the in&#8208;vitro characterization of their selective binding to DNA three&#8208;way junctions, cell&#8208;microscopy experiments demonstrated that a rhodamine&#8208;labeled FeII helicate was internalized and selectively stains DNA replication factories in functional cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regeneration and Self&#8208;Healing in DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly and reconfigurability of DNA origami is exploited to realize self&#8208;repairing functional nanodevices. A self&#8208;regenerating brightness label is realized by constant exchange of labeling strands from solution. Structural self&#8208;healing of a DNA origami nanoruler is achieved by excess of staple strands that exchange with enzymatically or photo&#8208;induced damaged strands.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology and advances in the DNA origami technique have enabled facile design and synthesis of complex and functional nanostructures. Molecular devices are, however, prone to rapid functional and structural degradation due to the high proportion of surface atoms at the nanoscale and due to complex working environments. Besides stabilizing mechanisms, approaches for the self&#8208;repair of functional molecular devices are desirable. Here we exploit the self&#8208;assembly and reconfigurability of DNA origami nanostructures to induce the self&#8208;repair of defects of photoinduced and enzymatic damage. We provide examples of repair in DNA nanostructures showing the difference between unspecific self&#8208;regeneration and damage specific self&#8208;healing mechanisms. Using DNA origami nanorulers studied by atomic force and superresolution DNA PAINT microscopy, quantitative preservation of fluorescence properties is demonstrated with direct potential for improving nanoscale calibration samples.

         <title>Endogenous mRNA Triggered DNA&#8208;Au Nanomachine for In Situ Imaging and Targeted Multimodal Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine which can be triggered by endogenous tumor growth&#8208;related TK1 mRNA has been devised as the combinatorial theranostic agent for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided chemo, genic, photodynamic, and photothermal synergistic targeted therapy of breast cancer. This theranostic nanoplatform achieves the significant inhibition of tumor growth and improvement of therapeutic efficacy through in situ imaging.







Abstract
The development of versatile nanotheranostic platforms that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic functions have always been an intractable challenge in precise cancer treatment. Herein, an aptamer&#8208;tethered deoxyribonucleic acids&#8208;gold particle (Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au) nanomachine has been developed for in situ imaging and targeted multimodal synergistic therapy of mammary carcinoma. Upon specifically internalized into MCF&#8208;7 cells, the tumor&#8208;related TK1 mRNA activates the Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine by DNA strand displacement cascades, resulting in the release of the fluorophore and antisense DNA as well as the aggregation of AuNPs for in situ imaging, suppression of survivin expression and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the controlled released drugs are used for chemotherapy, while under the laser irradiation the loaded photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy. The results confirm that the proposed Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine provides a powerful nanotheranostic platform for in situ imaging&#8208;guided combinatorial anticancer therapy.

         <title>Tetraimido Sulfuric Acid H2S(NtBu)4&#8212;Valence Isoelectronic to H2SO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S(NtBu)4 was synthesized, isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray charge density analysis. The topological parameters &#961;(r), &#8711;2&#961;(r), and &#1013; characterize the two different amido S&#8722;N(H)tBu and imido S&#8722;NtBu bonds as strongly polarized single bonds. The entire SN4 unit can easily adapt to different electronic requirements.







Abstract
The valence isoelectronic imido analog H2S(NtBu)4 (1) of sulfuric acid H2SO4 was synthesized, isolated, and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray charge density analysis. The latter reveals strongly polarized S&#948;+&#8722;N&#948;&#8722; bonds with virtually no double bond character. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;polarize S&#8722;N bonds are an advantageous and versatile feature of sulfur nitrogen ligands, which enables them to adapt to different electron requirements of various metal cations.

         <title>Unimolecular Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysts for Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis is described. Herein, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs), which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high molecular weight stereoregular polyesters.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;binding can regulate anion transport in chloride channels through dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions, which gives insights into the designing of new organocatalytic transformations but is surprisingly unexplored in polymerization catalysis. Herein, we describe an effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis where 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) to furnish highly isotactic poly(phenyllactic acid) (Ph&#8208;PLA) with molecular weight (MW) up to 150.0&#8197;kDa, which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high MW stereoregular polyesters. Calculations and experimental studies indicate a dynamic cooperative anion&#8208;binding mechanism, where the dynamic anion&#8208;binding interaction of thiourea moiety to propagating species facilitates efficient chain propagation and the synergetic decarboxylation retains high selectivity for OCA ring&#8208;opening over side reactions (such as cyclization, epimerization, and transesterification).

         <title>In Situ Observation of Non&#8208;Classical 2&#8208;Norbornyl Cation in Confined Zeolites at Ambient Temperature</title>

In situ observation of non&#8208;classical 2&#8208;norbornyl cation inside confined zeolite channels by taking advantage of AIMD simulations as well as 13C ssNMR experiments without super acidic environments at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Carbonium ions are an important class of reaction intermediates, but their dynamic evolution is difficult to be monitored by in situ techniques under experimental conditions because of their extremely short lifetime. Probably the most famous case is 2&#8208;norbornyl cation (2NB+): its existing form (classical or non&#8208;classical) had been debated for decades, until the concrete proof of non&#8208;classical geometry was achieved by X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization at ultra&#8208;low temperature (40&#8197;K) and super acidic environment. However, we lack the understanding about 2NB+ at ambient conditions. Herein, by taking advantage of the confinement effect and delocalized acidic environment of zeolites, we successfully stabilized 2NB+ and unequivocally confirmed its &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221; structure inside the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and 13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. It is the first time to in situ observe the non&#8208;classical 2NB+ without the super acidic environment at ambient temperature, which provides a new strategy to expand the carbocation chemistry.

         <title>Anisotropic Seeded Growth of Ag Nanoplates Confined in Shape&#8208;Deformable Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic seeded growth of silver nanoplates is performed in a shape&#8208;deformable polymer shell. The deformability of the shell provides unique adaptive control to the anisotropic growth and eventually turns itself into a conformal coating to protect the enclosed nanostructure against oxidative etching.







Abstract
Conventional templating synthesis confines the growth of seeds in rigid spaces to achieve faithful morphological replication. Herein, we explore the use of spherical shape&#8208;deformable polymeric nanoshells to regulate the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates. The flexible shells deform adaptively to accommodate the initial overgrowth of the seeds but restrict the growth in the directions where the shells are fully stretched, eventually producing nanoplates with an unconventional circular profile. The diameter of the final Ag nanoplates can be precisely predicted by stretching and flattering the nanoshells into a plate&#8208;like capsule while retaining their original internal surface area. Furthermore, unlike conventional templates, the polymer shells eventually turn themselves into a conformal coating that binds to the surface of the full&#8208;grown Ag nanoplates and significantly enhances their stability against oxidative etching.

         <title>Strategies to Enable Reversible Magnesium Electrochemistry: From Electrolytes to Artificial Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.







Abstract
The first prototype of a rechargeable magnesium (Mg) battery demonstrated two decades ago sparked tremendous interest in the electrochemical community due to their potential low cost, high volumetric energy density. However, the development of rechargeable Mg batteries has been hampered by the incompatibility between the Mg&#8208;metal anode and conventional carbonate electrolytes. Research has focused on electrolytes that are thermodynamically stable against reduction at the expense of low oxidation potential at the cathode side. Alternatively, the use of an artificial solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via surface coating presents promising results to address the Mg/electrolyte incompatibility and significantly broaden the selection of electrolytes. This minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.

         <title>London Dispersion Interactions Rather than Steric Hindrance Determine the Enantioselectivity of the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion (LD) interactions facilitate the enantioselectivity in the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata (CBS) reduction. Employing a combination of computational and experimental studies, we provide a modern view on the origin of enantioselectivity in this powerful organocatalyzed reaction. The results demonstrate that attractive LD interactions between the catalyst and the substrate rather than steric repulsion determine the selectivity.







Abstract
The well&#8208;known Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata (CBS) reduction is a powerful method for the asymmetric synthesis of alcohols from prochiral ketones, often featuring high yields and excellent selectivities. While steric repulsion has been regarded as the key director of the observed high enantioselectivity for many years, we show that London dispersion (LD) interactions are at least as important for enantiodiscrimination. We exemplify this through a combination of detailed computational and experimental studies for a series of modified CBS catalysts equipped with dispersion energy donors (DEDs) in the catalysts and the substrates. Our results demonstrate that attractive LD interactions between the catalyst and the substrate, rather than steric repulsion, determine the selectivity. As a key outcome of our study, we were able to improve the catalyst design for some challenging CBS reductions.

         <title>Precise Molecular&#8208;Level Modification of Nafion with Bismuth Oxide Clusters for High&#8208;performance Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid membrane (Nafion&#8208;Bi12&#8208;3&#8201;%) used as a high&#8208;performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) is fabricated through molecular&#8208;level doping of {H6Bi12O16} clusters into ionic phase of Nafion. The clusters combine with anionic side chains of Nafion and optimize the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nano&#8208;phases, resulting in hybrid membranes with high proton conductivity, ideal mechanical and chemical stability, and low methanol permeability.







Abstract
Fabricating proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with high ionic conductivity and ideal mechanical robustness through regulation of the membrane microstructures achieved by molecular&#8208;level hybridization remains essential but challenging for the further development of high&#8208;performance PEM fuel cells. In this work, by precisely hybridizing nano&#8208;scaled bismuth oxide clusters into Nafion, we have fabricated the high&#8208;performance hybrid membrane, Nafion&#8208;Bi12&#8208;3&#8201;%, which showed a proton conductivity of 386&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in aqueous solution with low methanol permeability, and conserved the ideal mechanical and chemical stabilities as PEMs. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to clarify the structural properties and the assembly mechanisms of the hybrid membrane on the molecular level. The maximum current density and power density of Nafion&#8208;Bi12&#8208;3&#8201;% for direct methanol fuel cells reached to 432.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 110.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides new insights into the design of versatile functional polymer electrolyte membranes through polyoxometalate hybridization.

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid membrane (Nafion&#8208;Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;3&#8201;%) used as a high&#8208;performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) is fabricated through molecular&#8208;level doping of {H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;} clusters into ionic phase of Nafion. The clusters combine with anionic side chains of Nafion and optimize the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nano&#8208;phases, resulting in hybrid membranes with high proton conductivity, ideal mechanical and chemical stability, and low methanol permeability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabricating proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with high ionic conductivity and ideal mechanical robustness through regulation of the membrane microstructures achieved by molecular&#8208;level hybridization remains essential but challenging for the further development of high&#8208;performance PEM fuel cells. In this work, by precisely hybridizing nano&#8208;scaled bismuth oxide clusters into Nafion, we have fabricated the high&#8208;performance hybrid membrane, Nafion&#8208;Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;3&#8201;%, which showed a proton conductivity of 386&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 80&#8201;&#176;C in aqueous solution with low methanol permeability, and conserved the ideal mechanical and chemical stabilities as PEMs. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to clarify the structural properties and the assembly mechanisms of the hybrid membrane on the molecular level. The maximum current density and power density of Nafion&#8208;Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;3&#8201;% for direct methanol fuel cells reached to 432.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 110.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This work provides new insights into the design of versatile functional polymer electrolyte membranes through polyoxometalate hybridization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multi&#8208;Talented Gallaphosphene for Ga&#8722;P&#8722;Ga Heteroallyl Cation Generation, CO2 Storage, and C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative addition of LGa to a phosphaketene&#8211;gallane yields gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL, from which the heteroallyl cation [LGaPGaL]+ is prepared by a halide abstraction reaction. Moreover, L(Cl)GaPGaL reversibly reacts with CO2 and selectively activates the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of acetophenone and acetone.







Abstract
Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL (2; L=HC[C(Me)N(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)]2), which is synthesized by reaction of LGa(Cl)PCO (1) with LGa, reacts with [Na(OCP)(dioxane)2.5] to LGa(OCP)PGaL (3), whereas chloride abstraction with LiBArF4 yields [LGaPGaL][BArF4] (4; BArF4=B(C6F5)4). 4 represents a heteronuclear analog of the allyl cation according to quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, 2 reversibly reacts with CO2 to yield L(Cl)Ga&#8722;P[&#956;&#8208;C(O)O]2GaL (5), while reactions with acetophenone and acetone selectively give compounds 6 and 7 by C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Nanoparticles Supported on Sub&#8208;Nanometer Oxide Films: Scaling Model Systems to Bulk Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium nanoparticles were partially covered by sub&#8208;nanometer thick layers of hectorite. Due to electronic interactions between the nanoparticles and the ultrathin layers the nanoparticles were positively charged. This in turn improved the performance for the oxidation of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Ultrathin layers of oxides deposited on atomically flat metal surfaces have been shown to significantly influence the electronic structure of the underlying metal, which in turn alters the catalytic performance. Upscaling of the specifically designed architectures as required for technical utilization of the effect has yet not been achieved. Here, we apply liquid crystalline phases of fluorohectorite nanosheets to fabricate such architectures in bulk. Synthetic sodium fluorohectorite, a layered silicate, when immersed into water spontaneously and repulsively swells to produce nematic suspensions of individual negatively charged nanosheets separated to more than 60&#8197;nm, while retaining parallel orientation. Into these galleries oppositely charged palladium nanoparticles were intercalated whereupon the galleries collapse. Individual and separated Pd nanoparticles were thus captured and sandwiched between nanosheets. As suggested by the model systems, the resulting catalyst performed better in the oxidation of carbon monoxide than the same Pd nanoparticles supported on external surfaces of hectorite or on a conventional Al2O3 support. XPS confirmed a shift of Pd 3d electrons to higher energies upon coverage of Pd nanoparticles with nanosheets to which we attribute the improved catalytic performance. DFT calculations showed increasing positive charge on Pd weakened CO adsorption and this way damped CO poisoning.

         <title>Accessing the Next Generation of Synthetic Mussel&#8208;Glue Polymers via Mussel&#8208;Inspired Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of cysteinyldopa as biogenic connectivity in proteins is used to inspire a chemical pathway toward mussel&#8208;adhesive mimics. The mussel&#8208;inspired polymerization (MIPoly) exploits the chemically diverse family of bisphenol monomers that is oxidizable with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid to give bisquinones. Those react at room temperature with dithiols in Michael&#8208;type polyaddition, leading to polymers with thiol&#8211;catechol&#8211;connectivities (TCC). A set of TCC&#8208;polymers prove adhesive behavior even on challenging poly(propylene) substrates and there they compete in dry adhesive strength with commercial epoxy resins. The MIPoly promises ease of scale up and exhibits high modularity to tailor adhesives, as proven on a small TCC&#8208;polymer library, where one candidate shows already wet adhesion performance on aluminum substrates in both water and sea water models.</dc:description>

         <title>Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanochromism from Metal&#8208;free Polycrystals: Noncovalent Conformational Locks Facilitating Wide&#8208;Range Redshift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic organic materials that present a large difference in fluorescence wavelength in the near&#8208;infrared region have important potential applications; however, few such metal&#8208;free luminophores have been reported. In this study, we design and prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron acceptors whose planar conformation can be locked by the hydrogen&#8208;bonded interactions. The formation of a planar fused&#8208;ring geometry via noncovalent conformational locking can narrow the optical band gap, enhance the molecular stability and rigidity, as well as increase the radiative rate. As expected, the polymorphs Re&#8208;phase and Ni&#8208;phase emit the high&#8208;brightness fluorescence with wavelength maxima (&#955;em,max) at 615 and 727 nm, respectively. Upon full grinding, the &#955;em,max of Re&#8208;phase is bathochromically shifted to 775 nm. Detailed spectrophotometric and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses demonstrate that the ground powder of Re&#8208;phase becomes metastable as a consequence of noncovalent conformational locking and that the red to near&#8208;infrared (large colour difference) mechanochromism arises from the high degree of conformational coplanarity. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a promising approach to the development of organic piezochromic materials with wide&#8208;range redshift and excellent penetrability.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting the Furan Ring Opening Reaction to Access New Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts with Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are visible light&#8208;responsive photoswitches with a variety of emerging applications in photoresponsive materials. Their two&#8208;step modular synthesis centered on the nucleophilic ring opening of an activated furan makes DASAs readily accessible. However, the more recent introduction of less reactive donors or acceptors renders the process slow and low yielding, which has limited their development. We demonstrate here that 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) promotes the ring opening reaction and stabilizes the open isomer, allowing for greatly reduced reaction times and increased yields for known derivatives. In addition, it provides access to previously unattainable DASA based photoswitches and DASA&#8208;polymer conjugates. The role of HFIP and the photochromic properties of a set of new&#160;DASAs, presented here, is probed using a combination of  1  H&#8208;NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. By introducing sterically hindered, electron poor amines the dark equilibrium was decoupled from closed isomer half&#8208;lives&#160;for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable K&#8211;CO2 Batteries with KSn Anode and Carboxyl&#8208;Containing Carbon Nanotube Cathode Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal K&#8211;CO2 batteries suffer from large polarization and safety hazards, which mainly result from the difficult decomposition of K2CO3 and dendrite growth. Moreover, the battery redox mechanism remains not fully understood. Here we report K&#8211;CO2 batteries with KSn alloy as anode and carboxyl&#8208;containing multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs&#8208;COOH) as cathode catalyst, proving the redox mechanism to be 4KSn + 3CO2 &#8596; 2K2CO3 + C + 4Sn. Compared with K metal, the less active and dendrite&#8208;free KSn anode effectively enhances the safety and stability of CO2 batteries. More importantly, the existence of &#8211;COOH induces strong ionic&#8208;bond interaction between MWCNTs&#8208;COOH and K2CO3, which weakens the C=O bond in K2CO3 and thus facilitates K2CO3 decomposition. As a result, the K&#8211;CO2 batteries show excellent cycling stability (an overpotential increase of 0.89 V after 400 cycles) and good rate performance (up to 2000 mA g&#8211;1). This work paves the way to develop highly stable and safe CO2&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Spring&#8208;Like Motion of an Anion&#8208;Based Triple Helicate by Tetraalkylammonium Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular springs are a class of molecular devices that may provide implications to the macroscopic spring behavior from the molecular level. Helical structures are suitable molecular springs because the specific twisting of the helical strands can cause spring&#8208;like (extension&#8210;contraction) movement along the axis upon external stimuli. Herein we report an anion&#8208;based triple&#8208;helicate spring, which can undergo reversible contraction&#8210;extension motion through introduction and removal of tetraalkylammonium cations, including TMA+ and analogous irregular tetrahedral cations bearing different alkyl chains, while the relative orientation of the two phosphate ions changes to facilitate guest inclusion. Notably, the degree of contraction (shortening of the helical pitch) can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the shape and size of guest cation. However, with the larger cations (TEA+, TPA+ and TBA+), the meso&#8208;helicate configuration is obtained, which interconverts with the helicate by addition/removal of TMA+ ion.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;type Doping Induced Electron Localization for Non&#8208;oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH  4  (NOCM) is an attractive potential way to use abundant methane resources. Herein, a n&#8208;type doped photocatalyst for NOCM is created by doping single&#8208;atom Nb into hierarchical porous TiO  2  &#8208;SiO  2  (TS) microarray, which exhibits a high conversion rate of 3.57 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  with good recyclability. The Nb dopant replaces the 6&#8208;coordinated titanium on the (1 0 1) surface and forms shallow electron&#8208;trapped surface polarons along [0 1 0] direction as verified by the experimental analyses and the first&#8208;principle density functional theory calculation. The comparison of different models proves that the electron localization caused by the n&#8208;type doping is beneficial to both the methane activation and ethane desorption. The positive effect of n&#8208;type dopant on CH  4  conversion is further verified on Mo&#8208;, W&#8208; and Ta&#8208;doped composites. In contrast, the doping of p&#8208;type dopant (Ga, Cu, Fe) shows less active influence. This study provides an in&#8208;depth insight into the effect of dopant type and is expected to guide the smart photocatalyst design for CH  4  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Heterointerfaces Achieve Delicate Reaction Kinetics towards Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrazine Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward hydrazine&#8208;assisted H2 production was designed by constructing the Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam (Ni3N&#8208;Co3N PNAs/NF). The catalyst can achieve energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) unit, showing its potential for practical applications.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting for H2 production is limited by the sluggish anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention. Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of &#8722;43 and &#8722;88&#8197;mV for 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and achieving an industry&#8208;level 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 200&#8197;mV for HzOR. The two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires the cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76&#8197;V for 10 and 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The H2 production powered by a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commercial solar cell are investigated to inspire future practical applications. DFT calculations decipher that heterointerfaces simultaneously optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work provides a rationale for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, and propels the practical energy&#8208;saving H2 generation techniques.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Based Molecular Cluster&#8208;Aggregates: Optical Barcoding and White&#8208;Light Emission with Nanosized {Ln20} Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of the energy transfer and the emission colour is demonstrated for the first time in molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, through the targeted choice of the lanthanide composition, a novel pure white&#8208;light emitting cluster&#8208;aggregate was isolated. This approach can pave new avenues into the future of efficient optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies.







Abstract
Counterfeit goods represent a major problem to companies, governments, and customers, affecting the global economy. In order to protect the authenticity of products and documents, optical anti&#8208;counterfeit technologies have widely been employed via the use of discrete molecular species, extended metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and nanoparticles. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the potential use of molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates (MCA) as optical barcodes via composition and energy transfer control. The tuneable optical properties for the [Ln20(chp)30(CO3)12(NO3)6(H2O)6], where chp&#8722;=deprotonated 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol, allow the fine control of the emission colour output, resulting in high&#8208;security level optical labelling with a precise read&#8208;out. Moreover, a unique tri&#8208;doped composition of GdIII, TbIII, and EuIII led to MCAs with white&#8208;light emission. The presented methodology is a unique approach to probe the effect of composition control on the luminescent properties of nanosized molecular material.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electric double layer chemistry and structure are identified to play a predominate role in governing the competitive reactions during solid electrolyte interphase formation on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. This knowledge affords critical guidance on the targeted interface design to enable a stable working lithium anode.







Abstract
The persistent efforts to reveal the formation and evolution mechanisms of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are of fundamental significance for the rational regulation. In this work, through combined theoretical and experimental model investigations, we elucidate that the electric double layer (EDL) chemistry at the electrode/electrolyte interface beyond the thermodynamic stability of electrolyte components predominately controls the competitive reduction reactions during SEI construction on Li metal anode. Specifically, the negatively&#8208;charged surface of Li metal will prompt substantial cation enrichment and anion deficiency within the EDL. Necessarily, only the species participating in the solvation shell of cations could be electrostatically accumulated in proximity of Li metal surface and thereafter be preferentially reduced during sustained dynamic cycling. Incorporating multi&#8208;valent cation additives to more effectively drag the favorable anionic SEI enablers into EDL is validated as a promising strategy to upgrade the Li protection performance. The conclusions drawn herein afford deeper understandings to bridge the EDL principle, cation solvation, and SEI formation, shedding fresh light on the targeted regulation of reactive alkali metal interfaces.

         <title>The Characteristics of Disulfide&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotational spectra of intermolecular clusters involving S&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C/N/O interactions reveal the structural and energetic features of disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds, providing a deep insight into molecular behaviors of the disulfide bond towards a hydrogen donor at the molecular level.







Abstract
The disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds in the three different model systems of diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2O/H2CO/HCONH2 clusters were characterized by high&#8208;resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed and are characterized by one of the three different S&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C/N/O disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and two O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2O/HCONH2 clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved non&#8208;covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated the first example to use imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone, and showed that the COFs&#8217; performance could surpass traditional materials. The mechanism for the performance of imine&#8208;based COFs is unveiled.







Abstract
Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone&#8208;responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. Herein, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine&#8208;based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1&#8197;s) to ozone as low as 0.1&#8197;ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine&#8208;based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the performance of imine&#8208;based COFs was unveiled in&#8208;depth by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.

         <title>Activation of Aptamers with Gain of Function by Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Clipping of Intramolecular Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule&#8208;mediated selection method was developed to obtain a &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; with activatable binding affinity toward its target. The aptamer's binding can be activated by &#8220;clipping&#8221; two intramolecular motifs via a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule.







Abstract
Click reactions have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221;, whose binding affinity is regulated by the &#8220;clip&#8221;&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de&#8197;novo selection of clipped aptamers against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated clipped aptamers can achieve the efficient transition from a binding&#8208;inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results showed that the clipped aptamer had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, clipped aptamers hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.

         <title>Analogous Mixed Matrix Membranes with Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of analogous mixed matrix membranes with self&#8208;assembled interface pathways were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;scale ethylene/ethane (0.416&#8197;nm/0.443&#8197;nm) separation. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and the self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed.







Abstract
The implementation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for sub&#8208;angstrom scale gas separations remains a grand challenge. Herein, a series of analogous mixed matrix membrane (AMMMs) were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom scale ethylene/ethane (0.416&#8197;nm/0.443&#8197;nm) separation. With a small number of GQDs (3.5&#8197;wt%) embedded in GQD/RIL AMMMs, ethylene permeability soared by 3.1&#8208;fold, and ethylene/ethane selectivity simultaneously boosted by nearly 60&#8201;% and reached up to 99.5, which outperformed most previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and their self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed, where the non&#8208;covalent interactions between RIL and GQDs induced the local arrangement of IL chains to self&#8208;assemble into plenty of compact and superfast interfacial pathways, contributing to the combination of superhigh permeability and selectivity.

The highly reactive divalent sandwich (Cot)2Tm{K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)}2 exhibits slow magnetic relaxation in absence of a DC field, an unprecedented report for f13 configuration. The variation of the counter&#8208;cation influences the magnetic relaxation in line with the overall stability of the organometallic sandwich complex.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide organometallics are well&#8208;known highly reducing compounds usually used for single electron transfer reactivity and small molecule activation. Thus, their very reactive nature prevented for many years the study of their physical properties, such as magnetic studies on a reliable basis. Herein, the access to rare organometallic sandwich compounds of TmII with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand impacts on the use of divalent organolanthanide compounds as an additional strategy for the design of performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMM). The first divalent thulium sandwich complex with f13 configuration behaving as a single&#8208;molecule magnet in absence of DC field is highlighted.

         <title>Highly Potent MRI Contrast Agent Displaying Outstanding Sensitivity to Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent MRI contrast agent based on paramagnetic Gd3+ was developed to selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions. The interaction with Zn2+ modulates the hydration of the complex, leading to a significant increase in its longitudinal relaxivity. The new responsive platform is highly suitable for studying the Zn&#8208;related physiological processes at high magnetic fields.







Abstract
Zinc ions play an important role in numerous crucial biological processes in the human body. The ability to image the function of Zn2+ would be a significant asset to biomedical research for monitoring various physiopathologies dependent on its fate. To this end, we developed a novel Gd3+ chelate that can selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions and alter its paramagnetic properties. More specifically, this lanthanide chelate displayed an extraordinary increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) of over 400&#8201;% upon interaction with Zn2+ at 7&#8197;T and 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is the greatest r1 enhancement observed for any of the metal ion&#8208;responsive Gd&#8208;based complexes at high magnetic field. A &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; mechanism responsible for these massive changes was confirmed through NMR and luminescence lifetime studies on a 13C&#8208;labeled Eu3+ analogue. This molecular platform represents a new momentum in developing highly suitable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for functional molecular imaging studies of Zn2+.

         <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides reducing dinitrogen, nitrogenases reduce CO to hydrocarbons, mediating C&#8722;C bond formation between multiple CO&#8208;derived ligands. To shed light on how multiple C&#8208;based ligands bind to the active site, we report a 1.33&#8197;&#197; resolution crystal structure of two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of molybdenum nitrogenase (see picture). The second CO ligand is coordinated to Fe6 in a previously unreported ligand binding mode.







Abstract
As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active&#8208;site FeMo&#8208;cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer&#8211;Tropsch&#8208;type chemistry). The C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO or CO&#8208;derived ligands bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33&#8197;&#197; resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo&#8208;cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged roles for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.

         <title>Regio&#8208;Regular Polymer Acceptors Enabled by Determined Fluorination on End Groups for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with 15.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization sites of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) plays a vital role in determining device performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Different from our recent work about fluoro&#8208; and bromo&#8208; co&#8208;modified end group of IC&#8208;FBr (a mixture of IC&#8208;FBr1 and IC&#8208;FBr2), in this paper, we synthesized and purified two regiospecific fluoro&#8208; and bromo&#8208; substituted end groups (IC&#8208;FBr&#8208;  o  &amp; IC&#8208;FBr&#8208;  m  ), which were then employed to construct two regio&#8208;regular polymer acceptors named PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  respectively. In comparison with its isomeric counterparts named PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  with different conjugated coupling sites, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  exhibits stronger and bathochromic absorption to achieve better photon harvesting. Meanwhile, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  adopts more ordered inter&#8208;chain packing and suitable phase separation after blending with the donor polymer PM6, which resulted in suppressed charge recombination and efficient charge transport. Strikingly,  we observed a dramatic performance difference between the two isomeric polymer acceptors PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  . While devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  can yield power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2%, devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  only show poor efficiencies of 1.4%. This work demonstrates the success of configuration&#8208;unique fluorinated end groups in designing high&#8208;performance regular polymer acceptors, which provides guidelines towards developing all&#8208;PSCs with better efficiencies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using small molecules to assemble well&#8208;controlled macro&#8208;sized helices is still a great challenge and highly desired for advanced materials. Here, we present the first example of the macro&#8208;scale helices co&#8208;assembled from temperature&#8208;responsive carbohydrate&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles (CHO&#8208;Bolas) and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (BDBA). The CHO&#8208;Bolas contained hydrophilic glucose or mannose moieties and hydrophobic coumarin dimer. They showed temperature&#8208;responsive reversible micelle&#8208;to&#8208;vesicle transition (MVT) in aqueous solutions. After the binding of carbohydrate moieties with boronic acids of BDBA in their alkaline solutions, right&#8208;handed helices were formed via the temperature&#8208;driven chirality transfer of D&#8208;glucose or D&#8208;mannose from molecular to supramolecular level. The helices with the length of hundreds of microns had helical pitches of 5.4&#8208;6.3 &#956;m and lamellae thickness of 0.2&#8208;0.3 &#956;m. These helices were co&#8208;assembled by unreacted BDBA, boronate esters (B&#8208;O&#8208;C bonds) between CHO&#8208;Bolas and BDBA, as well as boroxine anhydrides (B&#8208;O&#8208;B bonds) of self&#8208;condensed BDBA. After heating treatment at 300 &#176;C in nitrogen gas, helices displayed excellent morphological stability. Moreover, they emitted bright blue luminescence caused by strong self&#8208;condensation of BDBA and decomposition of coumarin dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Molecular Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites are promising for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), but still suffer from defects&#8208;mediated nonradiative losses, which represent a major efficiency&#8208;limiting factor in perovskite&#8208;based LEDs (PeLEDs). Reported here is a strategy to synthesize molecular passivators with different anchoring groups for defects passivation. The passivated perovskite thin films exhibit improved optoelectronic properties as well as reduced grain size and surface roughness, thus enable highly efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 15.6% using an imidazolium terminated passivator. Further demonstrated is that the  in&#8208;situ  formation of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phase on the surface of three&#8208;dimensional perovskite nanograins is responsible for surface defects passivation, which leads to significantly enhanced device performance. Our results provide new fundamental insights into the role of organic molecular passivators in boosting the performance of PeLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale Hybrid Amorphous/Graphitic Carbon as Key Towards Next&#8208;Generation Carbon&#8208;Based Oxidative Dehydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous/graphitic hybrid material is synthesized by growing nanoscale graphite crystallites in a non&#8208;nano polymer&#8208;derived carbon by catalytic graphitization. An active dehydrogenation catalyst is obtained by creating accessibility to these graphitic domains via selective oxidation. This carbon dehydrogenation catalyst offers a 10&#8208;fold increase in space&#8208;time&#8208;yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol compared to a carbon nanotube benchmark.







Abstract
A new strategy affords &#8220;non&#8208;nano&#8221; carbon materials as dehydrogenation catalysts that perform similarly to nanocarbons. Polymer&#8208;based carbon precursors that combine a soft&#8208;template approach with ion adsorption and catalytic graphitization are key to this synthesis strategy, thus offering control over macroscopic shape, texture, and crystallinity and resulting in a hybrid amorphous/graphitic carbon after pyrolysis. From this intermediate the active carbon catalyst is prepared by removing the amorphous parts of the hybrid carbon materials via selective oxidation. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol was chosen as test reaction, which shows that fine&#8208;tuning the synthesis of the new carbon catalysts allows to obtain a catalytic material with an attractive high selectivity (82&#8201;%) similar to a carbon nanotube reference, while achieving 10&#8197;times higher space&#8211;time yields at 330&#8201;&#176;C. This new class of carbon materials is accessible via a technically scalable, reproducible synthetic pathway and exhibits spherical particles with diameters around 100&#8197;&#956;m, allowing unproblematic handling similar to classic non&#8208;nano catalysts.

         <title>Synthetic DNA for Cell&#8208;Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods for using DNA to engineer cell surfaces on both a monovalent and polyvalent scale are introduced in this Minireview. The application of these methods for either the promotion or inhibition of cell&#8211;environment communication in different settings is also described.







Abstract
The cell membrane is not only a physical barrier, but also a functional organelle that regulates the communication between a cell and its environment. The ability to functionalize the cell membrane with synthetic molecules or nanostructures would advance cellular functions beyond what evolution has provided. The aim of this Minireview is to introduce recent progress in using synthetic DNA and DNA&#8208;based nanostructures for cell&#8208;surface engineering. We first introduce chemical conjugation and physical binding methods for monovalent and polyvalent surface engineering. We then introduce the application of these methods for either the promotion or inhibition of cell&#8211;environment communication in numerous applications, including the promotion of cell&#8211;cell recognition, regulation of intracellular pathways, protection of therapeutic cells, and sensing of the intracellular and extracellular microenvironments. Lastly, we summarize current challenges existing in this area and potential solutions to solve these challenges.

         <title>Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. They exhibited the highest mass activity among all non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in our best knowledge as well as a superb hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction performance in alkaline solution.







Abstract
Bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis (hydrogen&#8208;oxidation and hydrogen&#8208;evolution reactions) in alkaline solution is desirable but challenging. Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni&#8208;based materials are the only non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but they generally suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The final product exhibits an apparent hydrogen&#8208;oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and a record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 50&#8197;mV. A superior hydrogen&#8208;evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Large&#8208;Scale Membrane Transformations Driven by MinDE Biochemical Reaction Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We are demonstrating a new model membrane system, flat vesicles on top of a supported lipid bilayer. By reconstituting a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system, ATP&#8208;dissipating MinDE proteins, dynamic &#8220;breathing&#8221; deformations of the soft membrane vesicles and progressive membrane spreading are achieved, confirming that under this specific condition, MinDE reaction cycles can result in work performed on the biological membrane.







Abstract
The MinDE proteins from E.&#8197;coli have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer. MinDE oscillations can repeatedly deform these flat vesicles into tubules and promote progressive membrane spreading through membrane adhesion. Dependent on membrane and buffer compositions, Min oscillations further induce robust bud formation. Altogether, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, MinDE self&#8208;organization can result in work performed on biomimetic systems and achieve a straightforward mechanochemical coupling between the MinDE biochemical reaction cycle and membrane transformation.

         <title>An Aluminosilicate Zeolite Containing Rings of Tetrahedral Atoms with All Odd Numbers from Five to Eleven</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PST&#8208;31, a novel aluminosilicate zeolite with all odd&#8208;membered rings from five to eleven, has been synthesized in hydroxide media. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n&#8208;hexane to light olefins.







Abstract
Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;31, which has an unprecedented framework topology. This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al=16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing four&#8208;, five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered rings, which are connected by single four&#8208;membered rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by nine&#8208;, ten&#8208;, and eleven&#8208;membered rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [42.514.64.72.94] cavities composed of smaller [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n&#8208;hexane to light olefins.

The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing four&#8208;, five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered rings, which are connected by single four&#8208;membered rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.5&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by nine&#8208;, ten&#8208;, and eleven&#8208;membered rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.5&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;.6&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.9&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;] cavities composed of smaller [4.5&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hexane to light olefins.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Carboranealkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters: Size Conversion and UV/Vis&#8211;NIR Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboranealkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster Au28 possessing an open&#8208;shell electronic structure with 13 valence electrons was isolated through a facile self&#8208;reduction method in which it undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a smaller&#8208;sized cluster Au23 bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal&#8208;field&#8208;like split superatomic 1D orbitals. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis&#8211;NIR range and NIR emission.







Abstract
Structure evolution has become an effective way to assemble novel monolayer&#8208;protected metal nanomolecules. However, evolution with alkynyl&#8208;stabilized metal clusters still remains rarely explored. Herein, we present a carboranealkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster [Au28(C4B10H11)12(tht)8]3+ (Au28, tht=tetrahydrothiophene) possessing an open&#8208;shell electronic structure with 13 free electrons, which was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reduction method with 9&#8208;HC&#8801;C&#8208;closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H11 as the two&#8208;in&#8208;one reducing and protecting agent. Notably, Au28 undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a stable and smaller&#8208;sized nanocluster [Au23(C4B10H11)9(tht)6]2+ (Au23) bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal&#8208;field&#8208;like split superatomic 1D orbitals. The transformation process was systematically monitored with ESI&#8208;MS and UV/Vis absorption spectra. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis&#8211;NIR range and NIR emission, which facilitates their potential application in the biomedical and photocatalytic fields.

         <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence for promotional effect of acid sites on the diffusion of alkenes through small&#8208;pore zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diffusion of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is of fundamental importance for many zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. Transport of small alkenes in the confined pores of narrow pore zeolites can become hindered, resulting in a significant impact on the ultimate product selectivity and separation. Herein, intracrystalline light olefin/paraffin diffusion through the 8&#8208;ring windows of zeolite SAPO&#8208;34 is characterized by a complementary set of first&#8208;principle molecular dynamics simulations, PFG&#8208;NMR experiments and pulse&#8208;response Temporal Analysis of Products measurements, yielding information at different length and time scales. Our results clearly show a promotional effect of the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites on the diffusion rate of ethene and propene, whereas transport of alkanes is found to be insensitive to the presence of acid sites. The enhanced diffusivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons is ascribed to the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;H interactions with acid protons, as confirmed by IR spectroscopy measurements. The acid site distribution is proven to be an important design parameter for optimizing product distributions and separations.</dc:description>

         <title>The atypical hysteresis of [Fe(C6F5Tp)2]: Interplay between spin&#8208;crossovers and symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [Fe  II  (C  6  F  5  Tp)  2  ] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviors: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of  ca  . 65 K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated to a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated to the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly  ca  . 50% of SCO are switched.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the study on structure&#8208;property relationship for rational material design, hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shells structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one&#8208;step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even to duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote the gas releasing owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for the enhanced capillary force. It can provide effectively channels for water and gas and thus exhibit the superior electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Investigation of Ag&#8208;decorated Cu2O Nanocube Catalysts with enhanced CO2 Electroreduction toward Liquid Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of carbon dioxide into multicarbon liquid fuels by the CO  2  electrochemical reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) can contribute to the decarbonization of the global economy. Here, well&#8208;defined Cu  2  O nanocubes (NCs, 35 nm) uniformly covered with Ag nanoparticles (5 nm) were synthesized. When compared to bare Cu  2  O NCs, the catalyst with 5 at% Ag on Cu  2  O NCs displayed a two&#8208;fold increase in the Faradaic efficiency for C  2+  liquid products (30% at &#8208;1.0 V  RHE  ), including ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, and acetaldehyde, while formate and hydrogen were suppressed.  Operando  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the partial reduction of Cu  2  O during CO  2  RR, accompanied by a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on the CuO  x  NCs.  Operando  surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy data further uncovered significant variations in the CO binding to Cu, which were assigned to Ag&#8208;Cu sites formed during CO  2  RR that appear crucial for the C&#8208;C coupling and the enhanced yield of liquid products.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing physical oxidation state via resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy: Applications to iron model complexes and nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to recover physical oxidation state information, which may often be ambiguous in conventional X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, is demonstrated. By combining K&#946; XES with resonant excitation in the XAS pre&#8208;edge region, resonant K&#946; XES (or 1s3p RXES) data are obtained, which probe the 3dn+1 final state configuration. Comparison of the non&#8208;resonant and resonant XES for a series of high&#8208;spin ferrous and ferric complexes shows that oxidation state assignments that were previously unclear are now easily made. The present study spans iron tetrachlorides, iron sulfur clusters, and the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. While 1s3p RXES studies have previously been reported, to our knowledge, 1s3p RXES has not been previously utilized to resolve questions of metal valency in highly covalent systems. As such, the approach presented here provides chemists with means to more rigorously and quantitatively address challenging electronic structure questions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Stable Generation of Reactive Intermediates by Open Microfluidic Probe for Subcellular Free Radical Attack and Membrane Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subcellular stimulation by free radicals is crucial for deeper insight of cell behaviors. However, it remains a tough challenge due to the high spatial precision requirement and short life of radicals. Herein, we report a versatile open microfluidic probe for stable generation of free radical and subcellular stimulation. By optimizing parameters, the chemical reaction can be confined in a microregion with a diameter of several &#956;m, and the real&#8208;time produced reactive radicals can attack the desired subcellular region of a single cell. In order to reveal the attacked region, fluorescent cyanine 3 labeled tyramide free radicals are synthesized, and the target microregion on a single cell is successfully stained by the covalent linking reaction between radicals and membrane proteins, which proves the feasibility of our method. We believe this method will open new avenues for short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates stimulation at the single&#8208;cell/sub&#8208;cell level and selective membrane labeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanism of Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been widely employed to describe the new phase formed between anode and electrolyte in working batteries. Significant advances have been achieved on the structure and composition of SEI as well as on the possible ion transport mechanism. However, the nucleation and growth mechanism of SEI catches little attention, which requires the establishment of isothermal electrochemical crystallization theory. Herein we explore the virgin territory of electrochemically crystallized SEI. By using potentiostatic method to regulate the decomposition of anions, an anion&#8208;derived SEI forms on graphite surface at atomic scale. After fitting the cur&#8208;rent&#8208;time transients with Laviron theory and Avrami formula, we conclude that the formation of anion&#8208;derived interface is surface reaction controlled and obeys the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation and growth model. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images emphasize the conclusion, which reveals the mystery of isothermal electrochemical crystallization of SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Indole Dearomatization for Asymmetric Furoindoline Synthesis by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Bicyclic Thiopeptide Thiostrepton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in indole dearomatization, which serves as a useful tool in the total synthesis of related alkaloid natural products, has recently been renewed with the intention of developing new methods efficient in both yield and stereoselective control. Here, we report an enzymatic approach for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles in the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of furoindolines with a vicinal quaternary carbon stereogenic center. This approach depends on the activity of a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase, TsrE, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton. TsrE catalyzes 2,3&#8208;epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of&#160;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid or 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tryptophol to furoindoline ,&#160;with up to &gt; 99% conversion and &gt; 99%  ee  under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity&#8208;based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Biological Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Post&#8208;Functionalized Rhenium(I) Sites for Efficient Heterogeneous Visible Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;derived biological hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF&#8208;25) has been realized depending on guanine&#8208;quadruplex with the assistance of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which reacts with Re(CO)  5  Cl to give a post&#8208;functionalized HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic study on HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re confirms the covalent attachment of Re(bpy)(CO)  3  Cl segments to this HOF. Robust and recycled HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re bearing photocatalytic Re(bpy)(CO)  3  Cl centers displays good heterogeneous catalytic activity towards carbon dioxide photoreduction in the presence of [Ru(bpy)  3  ]Cl  2  and triisopropanolamine in CH  3  CN under visible&#8208;light irradiation, with both high CO production rate of 1448 &#956;mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  and high selectivity of 93%. Under the same conditions, the experimental turnover number of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re (50) is about 8 times as that of the homogeneous control Re(bpy)(CO)  3  Cl. The sustainably regenerated HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re  via  crystallization and post&#8208;modification processes shows recovered photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalysed Hydroarylation of Highly&#8208;Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroarylation is an effective strategy to rapidly increase the complexity of organic structures by transforming flat alkene moieties into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the hydroarylation of styrenes, however most of these reports examine the hydroarylation of unpolar, &#946;&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted styrenes, while exploring mainly electron&#8208;rich benzene nucleophiles. Herein we report a mild and general catalytic system for the selective hydroheteroarylation of multiply substituted styrenes and heteroaromatic styrenes. Mechanistic analysis of the reaction led to the discovery of commercially available 2,2&#8217;:5&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terthiophene as a key reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying the likelihood of structural models through a dynamically enhanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally characterizing new materials is tremendously challenging, especially when single crystal structures are hardly available which is often the case for covalent organic frameworks. Yet, knowledge of the atomic structure is key to establish structure&#8208;function relations and enable functional material design. Herein a new protocol is proposed to unambiguously predict the structure of poorly crystalline materials through a likelihood ordering based on the X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Key of the procedure is the broad set of structures generated from a limited number of building blocks and topologies, which is submitted to operando structural characterization. The dynamic averaging in the latter accounts for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experimental measurements, yielding unparalleled agreement with experimental powder XRD patterns. The proposed concept can hence unquestionably identify the structure of experimentally synthesized materials, a crucial step to design next generation functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dually&#8208;Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells with Reduced Voltage Loss and Increased Super Oxide Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has witnessed rapid progress. Nevertheless, the pervasive defects prone to non&#8208;radiative recombination and decomposition exist at the surface and the grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline perovskite films. Herein, we report a comprehensive dual&#8208;passivation (DP) strategy to effectively passivate the defects at both surface and GBs to enhance device performance and stability further. Firstly, a fluorinated perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide derivative is permeated in the perovskite metaphase during antisolvent treatment, and then a fluorinated bulky aromatic ammonium salt is introduced over the annealed perovskite. The reduction of defect density can be unambiguously proved by the superoxide species generation/quenching reaction. As a result, optimized planar PSCs demonstrate a decreased open&#8208;circuit voltages deficit from 0.47 to 0.39 V and the best efficiency of 23.80% from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized maximum power output efficiency of 22.99%. Without encapsulation, one typical device can maintain over 85% of the initial efficiency after heating on a hot plate at 100 &#176;C for 30 h under relative humidity (RH) of 70%. When the device is aged under 30 &#177; 5% RH, over 97% of its initial PCE is retained after 1700 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Unveiling Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coordination during Thermal Activation to Design High&#8208;Efficient Atomically Dispersed CoN4 Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed CoN  4  site catalysts are more desirable than FeN  4  site catalysts to enhance catalyst stability and mitigate Fenton reactions during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the lack of an understanding of CoN  x  active site formation during the critical thermal activation makes the rational catalyst design impossible. Here, we elucidate the structural evolution of CoN  4  sites during thermal activation by developing a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon host as an ideal model for Co  2+  ion adsorption. Subsequent  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track inactive Co&#8208;OH and Co&#8208;O species' conversion into active CoN  4  sites. The critical transition occurs at ~700&#176;C and becomes optimal at 900&#176;C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal&#8208;induced compressive strain of Co&#8208;N bonds in CoN  4  active sites formed at 900 &#176;C. Inspired by the new understanding, we developed a two&#8208;step chemical pre&#8208;doping and adsorption approach to designing a Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with increased CoN  4  site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated outstanding proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance and durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Li&#8208;Rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries can maximize the energy density at the cell level. However, without the Li compensation from the anode side, it faces much more challenging to achieve a long cycling life with a competitive energy density than Li metal&#8208;based batteries. Here, we prolong the lifespan of an anode&#8208;free Li metal battery by introducing Li&#8208;rich Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  into the cathode as a Li&#8208;ions extender. The Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  can release a large amount of Li&#8208;ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements. By the benefit of Li&#8208;rich cathode and high reversibility of Li metal on Cu foil, the anode&#8208;free pouch cells enable to achieve 447&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg  &#8722;1  &#160;energy density and 84% capacity retention after 100 cycles&#160;in the condition of limited electrolyte addition (E/C ratio of 2 g&#8201;Ah  &#8722;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Intracellular Dynamics of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide Using an Activatable NIR II Fluorescence Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the complex interplay among gasotransmitters is of great significance but remains technically challenging. In this study, we present the design and synthesis of a dually responsive BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC reporter for probing the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H  2  S in living cells. This designed reporter can repeatedly cycle S&#8208;nitrosation and transnitrosation reactions when successively treated with NO and H  2  S, thus affording the interchange of NIR fluorescence at 645 nm (NO) and NIR II fluorescence at 936 nm (H  2  S). In light of this unique fluorescence alternation between two colors, we synthesized water&#8208;soluble BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC dots to visualize the intracellular dynamics of NO and H  2  S. These molecular probes thus provide a toolbox to elucidate the interplaying roles of NO and H  2  S in the complex interaction networks of various signal transduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical conversion and locking of the imine linkage: enhancing the functionality of covalent organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation in COFs. Urgent solutions are therefore required in order to exploit the full potential of these materials, thereby enabling their technological application in (opto)electronics, sensing and energy storage devices. In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation. This Minireview describes the most enlightening examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the chemical locking of the imine bond in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis and Regulation of Oxidative Stress Based on {SbW8O30} By Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {SbW  8  O  30  } was successfully synthesized and exhibited inhibitory activity(IC  50  =0.29&#956;M). Based on proteomics analysis, Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  inhibited ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. In particular, the low expression of FAD/FMN&#8208;binding redox enzymes(relative expression ratio of the experimental group to the control=0.43843) could be attributed to the redox mechanism of Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  , which was consistent with the effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) and FMN&#8208;binding proteins on ATP formation. An electrochemical study showed that Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  combined with FMN to form Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  &#8208;2FMN complex through the one&#8208;electron processe of the W atoms. Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  acted as catalase and glutathione peroxidase to protect the cell from ROS stress, and the inhibition rates were 63.3% at 1.77 &#181;M of NADPH and 86.06% at 10.62 &#181;M of 2&#8208;hydroxy terephthalic acid. Overall, our results showed that POMs could be specific oxidative/antioxidant regulatory agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino functionalised hybrid ultramicroporous materials that enable single&#8208;step ethylene purification from a ternary mixture</title>

         <dc:description>Pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous (pore size &lt;7 &#197;) materials (HUMs) offer benchmark performance for trace carbon capture thanks to strong selectivity for CO2 over small gas molecules, including light hydrocarbons. That the prototypal pyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs are amenable to crystal engineering has enabled second generation HUMs to supersede the performance of the parent HUM, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn, mainly through substitution of the metal and/or the inorganic pillar. Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17 = aminopyrazine; M = Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) ethylene from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&#160;versus&#160;SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.</dc:description>

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective &#945;&#8208;Arylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Nitriles via [3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>

[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles has been developed by merging the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction into the S(IV)&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement process. The method enables the remarkable Z&#8208;selective synthesis of a wide variety of valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles that can be challenging to obtain by traditional synthetic methods.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction and [3, 3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement are two paradigms in organic synthesis. We have merged the two types of reactions to achieve [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles. The reaction was achieved by sequentially treating both coupling partners with electrophilic activator (Tf2O) and base, offering an effective approach to prepare synthetically versatile &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles with Z&#8208;selectivity through direct &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of unmodified &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles. The control experiments and DFT calculations support a four&#8208;stage reaction sequence, including the assembly of Tf2O activated aryl sulfoxide with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitrile, MBH&#8208;like Lewis base addition, [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement, and E1cB&#8208;elimination. Among these stages, the Lewis base addition is diastereoselective and E1cB&#8208;elimination is cis&#8208;selective, which could account for the remarkable Z&#8208;selectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Engineered Coatings via the Assembly of Amino&#8208;Quinone Networks</title>

Coatings and thin films of amino&#8208;quinone networks are prepared on various materials by a co&#8208;assembly strategy using quinones and polyamines. Using different building blocks affords precise control over the structures and properties of the coatings, which can serve as multifunctional reaction platforms to synthesize nanoparticles on surfaces.







Abstract
Engineering coatings with precise physicochemical properties allows for control over the interface of a material and its interactions with the surrounding environment. However, assembling coatings with well&#8208;defined properties on different material classes remains a challenge. Herein, we report a co&#8208;assembly strategy to precisely control the structure and properties (e.g., thickness, adhesion, wettability, and zeta potential) of coatings on various materials (27&#8197;substrates examined) using quinone and polyamine building blocks. By increasing the length of the amine building blocks from small molecule diamines to branched amine polymers, we tune the properties of the films, including the thickness (from ca. 5 to ca. 50&#8197;nm), interfacial adhesion (0.05 to 5.54&#8197;nN), water contact angle (130 to 40&#176;), and zeta potential (&#8722;42 to 28&#8197;mV). The films can be post&#8208;functionalized through the in&#8197;situ formation of diverse nanostructures, including nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanocrystals. Our approach provides a platform for the rational design of engineered, substrate&#8208;independent coatings for various applications.

Strain engineering of Mxene/carbon nanotube microspheres as electrocatalyst for Li&#8208;S batteries is used to realize high&#8208;efficiency LiPS catalytic conversion.







Abstract
Tensile&#8208;strained Mxene/carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres were developed as an electrocatalyst for the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) redox reaction. The internal stress on the surface results in lattice distortion with expanding Ti&#8722;Ti bonds, endowing the Mxene nanosheet with abundant active sites and regulating the d&#8208;band center of Ti atoms upshifted closer to the Fermi level, leading to strengthened LiPS adsorbability and accelerated catalytic conversion. The macroporous framework offers uniformed sulfur distribution, potent sulfur immobilization, and large surface area. The composite interwoven by CNT tentacle enhances conductivity and prevents the restacking of Mxene sheets. This combination of tensile strain effect and hierarchical architecture design results in smooth and favorable trapping&#8211;diffusion&#8211;conversion of LiPS on the interface. The Li&#8208;S battery exhibits an initial capacity of 1451&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C, rate capability up to 8&#8197;C, and prolonged cycle life.

         <title>Reversible Silylium Transfer between P&#8208;H and Si&#8208;H Donors</title>

A new PIII Lewis superacid with an ancillary molybdenum carbonyl fragment reacts with Et3SiH to give a P&#8208;H stabilized silylium ion that participates in catalytic hydrosilylation.







Abstract
The Mo=PR2 &#960;* orbital in a Mo phosphenium complex acts as acceptor in a new PIII&#8208;based Lewis superacid. This Lewis acid (LA) participates in electrophilic Si&#8208;H abstraction from E3SiH to give a Mo&#8208;bound secondary phosphine ligand, Mo&#8208;PR2H. The resulting Et3Si+ ion remains associated with the Mo complex, stabilized by &#951;1&#8208;P&#8208;H donation, yet undergoes rapid exchange with an &#951;1&#8208;Si&#8208;H adduct of free silane in solution. The equilibrium between these two adducts presents an opportunity to assess the role of this new LA in catalytic reactions of silanes: is the LA acting as a catalyst or as an initiator? Preliminary results suggest that a cycle including the Mo&#8208;bound phosphine&#8208;silylium adduct dominates in the catalytic hydrosilylation of acetophenone, relative to a putative cycle involving the silane&#8208;silylium adduct or &#8220;free&#8221; silylium.

The resulting Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion remains associated with the Mo complex, stabilized by &#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&#8208;H donation, yet undergoes rapid exchange with an &#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;Si&#8208;H adduct of free silane in solution. The equilibrium between these two adducts presents an opportunity to assess the role of this new LA in catalytic reactions of silanes: is the LA acting as a catalyst or as an initiator? Preliminary results suggest that a cycle including the Mo&#8208;bound phosphine&#8208;silylium adduct dominates in the catalytic hydrosilylation of acetophenone, relative to a putative cycle involving the silane&#8208;silylium adduct or &#8220;free&#8221; silylium.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Radical Carbonyl Propargylation by Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2464-2471, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the radical three&#8208;component carbonyl propargylation between 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes, and suitable radical precursors through dual chromium/photoredox catalysis is reported for the first time. This redox&#8208;neutral reaction occurs under very mild conditions, shows high functional group tolerance and represents a complementary novel approach for preparing valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.







Abstract
Carbonyl propargylation has been established as a valuable tool in the realm of carbon&#8211;carbon bond forming reactions. The 1,3&#8208;enyne moiety has been recognized as an alternative pronucleophile in the above transformation through an ionic mechanism. Herein, we report for the first time, the radical carbonyl propargylation through dual chromium/photoredox catalysis. A library of valuable homopropargylic alcohols bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers could be obtained by a catalytic radical three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes and suitable radical precursors (41 examples). This redox&#8208;neutral multi&#8208;component reaction occurs under very mild conditions and shows high functional group tolerance. Remarkably, bench&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive CrCl3 could be employed as a chromium source. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, which offers a complementary and novel approach towards the preparation of valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.

         <title>Breaking Platinum Nanoparticles to Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8208;C4 Co&#8208;catalysts for Enhanced Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>

The single site of Pt&#8208;C4 in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Pt1&#8208;CN) is reported by a high&#8208;temperature calcination process. It features fast carrier migration with low resistance across the catalyst&#8211;solution interface. Benefiting from above merits and the tight contact between CuS semiconductor and Pt1&#8208;CN, the Pt1&#8208;CN@CuS gives a photocatalytic H2 generation rate of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an AQY of 50.3&#8201;% under the illumination of LED&#8208;530.







Abstract
Effective transfer and utilization of the photogenerated electrons are a key factor for achieving highly efficient H2 generation by photocatalytic water splitting. Apart from the activity of the co&#8208;catalyst, the interface between the co&#8208;catalyst and semiconductor is of particular importance. Guided by DFT calculations, single&#8208;atom (SA) Pt doped carbon nitride (CN) is successfully synthesized for use as the co&#8208;catalyst to the semiconducting CuS. The catalyst system (Pt1&#8208;CN@CuS) exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic performance for water splitting with a H2 production rate of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 50.3&#8201;% under the illumination of LED&#8208;530. Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency is calculated to be 0.5&#8201;% under AM&#8197;1.5 illumination. This is the very first investigation of SA as the co&#8208;catalyst, which decreases the overpotential of CN during the water splitting and lowers interfacial resistance of the catalyst/co&#8208;catalyst and co&#8208;catalyst/electrolyte.

         <title>Activation of the G&#8208;Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptor Rhodopsin by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2288-2295, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules flood the protein core of visual rhodopsin to form a solvent&#8208;swollen active state upon light absorption. Binding of a peptide analogue of transducin is coupled to hydration changes in catalytic activation of the G&#8208;protein. The soft membrane matter comprises lipids and water, which interact with rhodopsin in the signaling mechanism to control visual function.







Abstract
Visual rhodopsin is an important archetype for G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors, which are membrane proteins implicated in cellular signal transduction. Herein, we show experimentally that approximately 80 water molecules flood rhodopsin upon light absorption to form a solvent&#8208;swollen active state. An influx of mobile water is necessary for activating the photoreceptor, and this finding is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combined force&#8208;based measurements involving osmotic and hydrostatic pressure indicate the expansion occurs by changes in cavity volumes, together with greater hydration in the active metarhodopsin&#8208;II state. Moreover, we discovered that binding and release of the C&#8208;terminal helix of transducin is coupled to hydration changes as may occur in visual signal amplification. Hydration&#8211;dehydration explains signaling by a dynamic allosteric mechanism, in which the soft membrane matter (lipids and water) has a pivotal role in the catalytic G&#8208;protein cycle.

By introducing phenyl or o&#8208;tolyl groups into different positions of the same acceptor backbone, the lowest triplet energy levels of red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters can be tuned from locally excited triplet (3LEA) to charge transfer triplet (3CT) states, resulting in enhancement of the rates of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and boosting efficiencies in both vacuum&#8208; and solution&#8208;processed OLEDs.







Abstract
Developing red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for high&#8208;performance OLEDs is still facing great challenge. Herein, three red TADF emitters, pDBBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, pDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, and oDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, are designed and synthesized with same donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) backbone with different peripheral groups attaching on the A moieties. Their lowest triplet states change from locally excited to charge transfer character leading to significantly enhance reverse intersystem crossing process. In particular, oDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ exhibits efficient TADF feature and exciton utilization. It not only achieves an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.1&#8201;% in red vacuum&#8208;processed OLED, but also realize a high EQE of 18.5&#8201;% in a solution&#8208;processed OLED, which is among the best results in solution&#8208;processed red TADF OLEDs. This work provides an effective strategy for designing red TADF molecules by managing energy level alignments to facilitate the up&#8208;conversion process and thus enhance exciton harvesting.

         <title>Going Platinum to the Tune of a Remarkable Guanine Quadruplex Binder: Solution&#8208; and Solid&#8208;State Investigations.</title>

A novel platinum complex, stacking onto guanine quadruplex faces with very high affinity, is described. With a strong tolerance for various quadruplex topologies and good selectivity for quadruplex vs. duplex structures, it provides a unique platform for further evolution, facilitated by the solved solid&#8208;state structure with telomeric DNA.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplex recognition has gained increasing attention, inspired by the growing awareness of the key roles played by these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid architectures in cellular regulatory processes. We report here the solution and solid&#8208;state studies of a novel planar platinum(II) complex that is easily assembled from a simple ligand, and exhibits notable binding affinity for guanine quadruplex structures, while maintaining good selectivity for guanine quadruplex over duplex structures. A crystal structure of this ligand complexed with a telomeric quadruplex confirms double end&#8208;capping, with dimerization at the 5&#8242; interface.

         <title>Elucidation of Diverse Solid&#8208;State Packing in a Family of Electron&#8208;Deficient Expanded Helicenes via Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2493-2499, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of five diverse expanded helicenes was accessed through divergent functionalization and characterized using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), revealing previously inaccessible structural data. Features such as long range &#960;&#8208;stacking, homochiral crystals, and emergent nanometer scale cavities were observed, spanning four different space groups.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state packing plays a defining role in the properties of a molecular organic material, but it is difficult to elucidate in the absence of single crystals that are suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction. Herein, we demonstrate the coupling of divergent synthesis with microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) for rapid assessment of solid&#8208;state packing motifs, using a class of chiral nanocarbons&#8212;expanded helicenes&#8212;as a proof of concept. Two highly selective oxidative dearomatizations of a readily accessible helicene provided a divergent route to four electron&#8208;deficient analogues containing quinone or quinoxaline units. Crystallization efforts consistently yielded microcrystals that were unsuitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, but ideal for MicroED. This technique facilitated the elucidation of solid&#8208;state structures of all five compounds with &lt;1.1&#8197;&#197; resolution. The otherwise&#8208;inaccessible data revealed a range of notable packing behaviors, including four different space groups, homochirality in a crystal for a helicene with an extremely low enantiomerization barrier, and nanometer scale cavities.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Single&#8208;Component Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2526-2533, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By delicate design of coordination polymers incorporating different halogens, multi&#8208;mode color&#8208;tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL) from green to yellow or green to red was possible. The LPL emission colors can be tuned by time, excitation, and temperature, revealing the counter&#8208;balanced mechanisms from single&#8208;molecule and aggregate triplet excited states resulting from an external heavy&#8208;atom effect.







Abstract
Materials with tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties have wide applications in security signs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encrypting, and other fields. However, the majority of reported tunable LPL materials are pure organic molecules or polymers. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic coordination polymers displaying color&#8208;tunable LPL were synthesized by the self&#8208;assembly of HTzPTpy ligand with different cadmium halides (X=Cl, Br, and I). In the solid state, their LPL emission colors can be tuned by the time&#8208;evolution, as well as excitation and temperature variation, realizing multi&#8208;mode dynamic color tuning from green to yellow or green to red, and are the first such examples in single&#8208;component coordination polymer materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the modification of LPL is due to the balanced action from single molecule and aggregate triplet excited states caused by an external heavy&#8208;atom effect. The results show that the rational introduction of different halide anions into coordination polymers can realize multi&#8208;color LPL.

Rationally designed metal&#8208;free chromophores capable of H&#8208;bonded directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and &#963;&#8208;conjugation allow building molecular crystals exhibiting outstanding long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence. Single crystal analysis reveals a columnar&#8208;like supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding. From this, guidelines for obtaining efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescent molecular crystals are established.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence from organic molecular crystals attracts great attention. Persistent luminescence depends on the electronic properties of the molecular components, mainly &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) chromophores, and their molecular packing. Here, a strategy is developed by designing two isomeric molecular phosphors incorporating and combining a bridge for &#963;&#8208;conjugation between the D and A units and a structure&#8208;directing unit for H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Calculations highlight the critical role played by the two degrees of freedom of the &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridge on the chromophore optical properties. The molecular crystals exhibit RTP quantum yields up to 20&#8201;% and lifetimes up to 520&#8197;ms. The crystal structures of the efficient phosphorescent materials establish the existence of an unprecedented well&#8208;organization of the emitters into 2D rectangular columnar&#8208;like supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding.

         <title>CoNi Alloy Nanoparticles Embedded in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Carbon for the Highly Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton via a Charge&#8208;Transfer Effect</title>

Highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr is achieved on CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded MOF&#8208;derived carbon adsorbents via charge&#8208;transfer effect. It affords record&#8208;high IAST selectivity and Henty's selectivity of Xe/Kr mixture.







Abstract
Separation of Xe and Kr is one of the greatest challenges in the gas industries owing to their close molecular structure and similar properties. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation using chemically stable carbon adsorbents is a promising technology. We propose a strategy for Xe/Kr separation using MOF&#8208;derived metallic carbon adsorbents. M&#8208;Gallate (M=Ni, Co) were used as precursors to fabricate CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded carbon adsorbents by one&#8208;step auto&#8208;reduction pyrolysis. The optimal NiCo@C&#8208;700 exhibits record&#8208;high IAST selectivity (24.1) and Henry's selectivity (20.1) of Xe/Kr among reported carbon adsorbents. DFT calculations, local density of states calculation, charge density difference, and Bader charge analysis reveal the great affinity with Xe benefits from the presence of Ni or CoNi nanoparticles as a result of more charge transfer from Xe than Kr to metal, thus providing higher binding energy. Breakthrough experiments further verify NiCo@C&#8208;700 a promising candidate for Xe/Kr separation.

         <title>Optimized Active Layer Morphologies via Ternary Copolymerization of Polymer Donors for 17.6&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Enhanced Fill Factor</title>

A terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 was developed by incorporating the third 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz) unit into the PM6 backbone. The introduction of DTBTz can tailor the molecular ordering, orientation, and aggregation properties, and then optimize the morphology and electrical properties of devices, ultimately improving fill factor (0.77) and thus device efficiency (17.6&#8201;%).







Abstract
Regulating molecular structure to optimize the active layer morphology is of considerable significance for improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we demonstrated a simple ternary copolymerization approach to develop a terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 by incorporating the 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz, 20 mol%) unit into the backbone of PM6 (PM6&#8208;Tz00). This method can effectively tailor the molecular orientation and aggregation of the polymer, and then optimize the active layer morphology and the corresponding physical processes of devices, ultimately boosting FF and then PCE. Hence, the PM6&#8208;Tz20: Y6&#8208;based OSCs achieved a PCE of up to 17.1% with a significantly enhanced FF of 0.77. Using Ag (220 nm) instead of Al (100 nm) as cathode, the champion PCE was further improved to 17.6%. This work provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy to optimize the active layer morphology of OSCs for improving photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Low&#8208;Cost Industrial Organic Pigment Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2485-2492, February 1, 2021. </description>

A low&#8208;cost industrial organic pigment, quinacridone (QA), was applied as surface passivation agent for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by solution processing of a soluble QA derivative followed by thermal annealing to convert it into insoluble QA. Passivation with strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, together with the hydrophobicity of QA coating, enabled highly efficient PSCs with remarkable stability.







Abstract
Surface passivation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a low&#8208;cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA) is presented. The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl)&#8208;quinacridone (TBOC&#8208;QA), followed by thermal annealing to convert TBOC&#8208;QA into insoluble QA. With halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1&#8201;% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9&#8201;% recorded for the unmodified devices. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to greatly enhanced contact angle from 35.6&#176; for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2&#176; for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. The stability of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were significantly enhanced, retaining about 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000&#8197;hours storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Reductive Arylation of Amides via a Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;Coupling and Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2472-2477, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic intermolecular addition of two disparate nucleophiles to the amide&#8208;carbonyl carbon in a single operational step is reported. The method relies on nickel catalysis and enables the conversion of amides to chiral alcohols via a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling/transfer&#8208;hydrogenation cascade process.







Abstract
We report a means to achieve the addition of two disparate nucleophiles to the amide carbonyl carbon in a single operational step. Our method takes advantage of non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal catalysis and allows for the facile conversion of amides to chiral alcohols via a one&#8208;pot Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling/transfer&#8208;hydrogenation process. This study is anticipated to promote the development of new transformations that allow for the conversion of carboxylic acid derivatives to functional groups bearing stereogenic centers via cascade processes.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Controlled Binding of Carbon Dioxide by an Iron Center: Insights from Ultrafast Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2519-2525, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshots from femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared laser spectroscopy reveal spin&#8208;dependent formation of different binding modes of carbon dioxide to a transition&#8208;metal center. The ultrafast excitation of an iron(III) oxalate precursor complex with ultraviolet pulses releases a neutral carbon dioxide molecule within 500&#8197;fs and generates a nascent iron&#8208;CO2&#8208;primary complex that isomerizes on a picosecond time scale.







Abstract
The influence of the spin on the mode of binding between carbon dioxide (CO2) and a transition&#8208;metal (TM) center is an entirely open question. Herein, we use an iron(III) oxalato complex with nearly vanishing doublet&#8211;sextet gap, and its ultrafast photolysis, to generate TM&#8208;CO2 bonding patterns and determine their structure in&#8197;situ by femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. The formation of the nascent TM&#8208;CO2 species according to [L4FeIII(C2O4)]+ + h&#957; &#8594; [L4Fe(CO2)]+ + CO2, with L4=cyclam, is evidenced by the coincident appearance of the characteristic asymmetric stretching absorption of the CO2&#8208;ligand between 1600&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 1800&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and that of the free CO2&#8208;co&#8208;fragment near 2337&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On the high&#8208;spin surface (S=5/2), the product complex features a bent carbon dioxide radical anion ligand that is O&#8208;&#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;bound to the metal. In contrast, on the intermediate&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin surfaces, the product exhibits a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;bound, bent carbon dioxide ligand that has either a partial open&#8208;shell (for S=3/2) or fully closed&#8208;shell character (for S=1/2).

NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme required for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Here we report the crystal structures of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum NifB without and with a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters, which provide important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with the formation of a cofactor core.







Abstract
NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme required for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Herein, we report the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum NifB without (apo MtNifB) and with (holo MtNifB) a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters. Both apo and holo MtNifB contain a partial TIM barrel core, but unlike apo MtNifB, holo MtNifB is fully assembled and competent in cofactor biosynthesis. The radical SAM (RS)&#8208;cluster is coordinated by three Cys, and the adjacent K1&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters, representing the precursor to an 8Fe cofactor core, are each coordinated by one His and two Cys. Prediction of substrate channels, combined with in silico docking of SAM in holo MtNifB, suggests the binding of SAM between the RS&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters and putative paths for entry of SAM and exit of products of SAM cleavage, thereby providing important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with cofactor core formation.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Torpedo&#8208;Like Persistent Luminescence Nanoparticles for Autofluorescence&#8208;Free Biosensing and High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>

Uniformly torpedo&#8208;shaped green&#8208;emitting Zn2GeO4: Mn2+, Pr3+ nanoparticles with good persistent luminescence performance were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The pH&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence of ZGMP was found and explored for autofluorescence&#8208;free biosensing and high&#8208;level information encryption.







Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) with intrinsic stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are desirable because of no autofluorescence background and natural responsive luminescence. However, the stimuli&#8208;responsive features of pure PLNPs have been unexplored. Here we show a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis of green&#8208;emitting Zn2GeO4:Mn2+,Pr3+ nanoparticles (ZGMP) with regular shape, uniform size and good afterglow luminescent performance. We also report the pH stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent behavior of ZGMP and its possible mechanism. Taking the intriguing feature of pH responsive persistent luminescence, we explore ZGMP as autofluorescence&#8208;free probes to achieve stimuli&#8208;activated signal switch for biosensing by integrating enzyme catalysis reaction mediated pH modulation. The pH&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence also makes ZGMP promising for high&#8208;level information encryption.

         <title>The Synthesis, Bonding, and Transformation of a Ligand&#8208;Protected Gold Nanohydride Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2424-2430, February 1, 2021. </description>

The hitherto largest gold nanohydride cluster, [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+, was synthesized and its structural, bonding, and chemical properties were elucidated. A wide range of hydrogen loss pathways were observed, providing critical information about hydrogen&#8208;related chemical transformations catalyzed by gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Gold does not react with H2 to form bulk hydrides. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a gold nanohydride protected by diphosphine ligands, [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+ [dppo=1,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)octane]. The Au22 core consists of two Au11 units bonded by eight Au atoms not coordinated by the diphosphine ligands. The four H atoms are found to bridge the eight uncoordinated Au atoms at the interface. Each Au11 unit can be viewed as a tetravalent superatom forming four delocalized Au&#8208;H&#8208;Au bonds, similar to the quadruple bond first discovered in the [Re2Cl8]2&#8722; inorganic cluster. The [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+ nanohydride is found to lose H atoms over an extended time via H evolution (H2), proton (H+) and hydride (H&#8722;) releases. This complete repertoire of H&#8208;related transformations suggests that the [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+ nanohydride is a versatile model catalyst for understanding the mechanisms of chemical reactions involving hydrogen on the surface of gold nanoparticles.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of (Hetero)Aromatic Nitriles from C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds**

C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds have been converted to cyano derivatives under metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free condition in the presence of visible light and an organic dye. Potential applications of this method in the late&#8208;stage transformation of complex drug molecules, steroid derivatives, and gram&#8208;scale reactions have been described.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to value&#8208;added products is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. We report the use of the commercially available organic dye 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPP) for the conversion of methylarenes to the corresponding aryl nitriles via a photocatalytic process. Applying this methodology, a variety of cyanobenzenes have been synthesized in good to excellent yield under metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free conditions. We demonstrate the scope of the method with over 50 examples including late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules (celecoxib) and complex structures such as l&#8208;menthol, amino acids, and cholesterol derivatives. Furthermore, the presented synthetic protocol is applicable for gram&#8208;scale reactions. In addition to methylarenes, selected examples for the cyanation of aldehydes, alcohols and oximes are demonstrated as well. Detailed mechanistic investigations have been carried out using time&#8208;resolved luminescence quenching studies, control experiments, and NMR spectroscopy as well as kinetic studies, all supporting the proposed catalytic cycle.

         <title>Selective Transformation of Nickel&#8208;Bound Formate to CO or C&#8722;C Coupling Products Triggered by Deprotonation and Steered by Alkali&#8208;Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2312-2321, February 1, 2021. </description>

A deceptively simple proton abstraction from nickel&#8208;bound formate not only prepares the resulting CO22&#8722; unit for the release of CO in contact with electrophiles but opens up unique complex reaction schemes including reduction of nickel(II) to nickel(I) and coupling of CO2 units to give oxalate and mesoxalate. Mesoxalate formation from individual CO2 units is so far unprecedented.







Abstract
The complexes [LtBuNi(OCO&#8208;&#954;2O,C)]M3[N(SiMe3)2]2 (M=Li, Na, K), synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBuNiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3)2], feature a NiII&#8722;CO22&#8722; core surrounded by Lewis&#8208;acidic cations (M+) and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. The results point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na, and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni&#8722;OSiMe3 complex. Furthermore, in case of K+, the {[K3[N(SiMe3)2]2}+ shell around the Ni&#8722;CO22&#8722; entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3)2] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBuNiOOCH] is decreased from 3 to 0.5, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBuNiI(&#956;&#8208;OOCH)NiILtBu]K and [LtBuNi(C2O4)NiLtBu]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2C&#8208;CO2&#8208;CO2]4&#8722;) ligands.

&lt;p&gt;A deceptively simple proton abstraction from nickel&#8208;bound formate not only prepares the resulting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; unit for the release of CO in contact with electrophiles but opens up unique complex reaction schemes including reduction of nickel(II) to nickel(I) and coupling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units to give oxalate and mesoxalate. Mesoxalate formation from individual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units is so far unprecedented.

         <title>Potential&#8208;Dependent Morphology of Copper Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction Revealed by In&#8197;Situ Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2561-2568, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper catalyst for electrochemical CO2 conversion has been unraveled in situ down to the atomic scale using electrochemical atomic force microscopy under highly gas&#8208;evolving reaction conditions. Oxidized copper surfaces enter different morphological regimes in cathodic potential ranges down to &#8722;1.1&#8197;VRHE coupled with surface reconstructions and varying density of undercoordinated reaction sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical AFM is a powerful tool for the real&#8208;space characterization of catalysts under realistic electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) conditions. The evolution of structural features ranging from the micrometer to the atomic scale could be resolved during CO2RR. Using Cu(100) as model surface, distinct nanoscale surface morphologies and their potential&#8208;dependent transformations from granular to smoothly curved mound&#8208;pit surfaces or structures with rectangular terraces are revealed during CO2RR in 0.1&#8197;m KHCO3. The density of undercoordinated copper sites during CO2RR is shown to increase with decreasing potential. In&#8197;situ atomic&#8208;scale imaging reveals specific adsorption occurring at distinct cathodic potentials impacting the observed catalyst structure. These results show the complex interrelation of the morphology, structure, defect density, applied potential, and electrolyte in copper CO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Structural Basis for &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimicry and Inhibition of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions with Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2296-2303, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide to oligourea replacements have been employed to generate high&#8208;affinity foldamer ligands targeted to specific proteins. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of several peptide&#8211;oligourea hybrids bound to their respective protein targets confirms the high degree of &#945;&#8208;helix mimicry that can be achieved with oligoureas and reveals general principles enabling the design of more stable peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
Efficient optimization of a peptide lead into a drug candidate frequently needs further transformation to augment properties such as bioavailability. Among the different options, foldamers, which are sequence&#8208;based oligomers with precise folded conformation, have emerged as a promising technology. We introduce oligourea foldamers to reduce the peptide character of inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPI). However, the precise design of such mimics is currently limited by the lack of structural information on how these foldamers adapt to protein surfaces. We report a collection of X&#8208;ray structures of peptide&#8211;oligourea hybrids in complex with ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and vitamin&#8197;D receptor and show how such hybrid oligomers can be designed to bind with high affinity to protein targets. This work should enable the generation of more effective foldamer&#8208;based disruptors of PPIs in the context of peptide lead optimization.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Bistability in a Ni&#8211;Fe Chain: Electron Transfer Controlled by Temperature, Pressure, Light, and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2330-2338, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bistable [Ni(cyclam)]&#8208;[Fe(CN)6]&#8208;based chain exhibits unprecedented four&#8208;way switching of magnetic and optical properties at room temperature. The reversible electron&#8208;transfer phase transition between the NiII&#8208;FeIII and NiIII&#8208;FeII valence states can be triggered by temperature (T), pressure (P), or light (h&#957;), and reversibly turned off by dehydration.







Abstract
Bistable and stimuli&#8208;responsive molecule&#8208;based materials are promising candidates for the development of molecular switches and sensors for future technologies. The CN&#8208;bridged {NH4[Ni(cyclam)][Fe(CN)6]&#8901;5&#8201;H2O}n chain exists in two valence states: NiII&#8208;FeIII (1HT) and NiIII&#8208;FeII (1LT) and shows unique multiresponsivity under ambient conditions to various stimuli, including temperature, pressure, light, and humidity, which generate measurable response in the form of significant changes in magnetic susceptibility and color. The electron&#8208;transfer phase transition 1LT&#8596;1HT shows room&#8208;temperature thermal hysteresis, can be induced by irradiation, and shows high sensitivity to small applied pressure, which shifts it to higher temperatures. Additionally, it can be reversibly turned off by dehydration to the {NH4[NiII(cyclam)][FeIII(CN)6]}n (1&#8201;d) phase, which features the NiII&#8208;FeIII valence state over the whole temperature range, but responds to pressure by yielding NiIII&#8208;FeII above 1.06&#8197;GPa.

         <title>Breaking the Linear Scaling Relationship by Compositional and Structural Crafting of Ternary Cu&#8211;Au/Ag Nanoframes for Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2508-2518, February 1, 2021. </description>

Cu&#8211;Ag/Au nanoframes were prepared to break the intrinsic scaling relationship of intermediate binding associated with carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RR) and resulted in very high Faradic efficiencies for ethylene production in both an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell. Both the *CO&#8211;*CO coupling and *CO&#8594;*CHO hydrogenation steps were found to be rate&#8208;determining and to steer the reaction towards ethylene production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide into high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) chemical feedstocks offers a promising avenue to liberate the chemical industry from fossil&#8208;resource dependence and eventually close the anthropogenic carbon cycle but is severely impeded by the lack of high&#8208;performance catalysts. To break the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of CO2 reduction reactions, ternary Cu&#8211;Au/Ag nanoframes were fabricated to decouple the functions of CO generation and C&#8722;C coupling, whereby the former is promoted by the alloyed Ag/Au substrate and the latter is facilitated by the highly strained and positively charged Cu domains. Thus, C2H4 production in an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell occurred with high Faradic efficiencies of 69&#177;5 and 77&#177;2&#8201;%, respectively, as well as good electrocatalytic stability and material durability. In situ IR and DFT calculations unveiled two competing pathways for C2H4 generation, of which direct CO dimerization is energetically favored.

         <title>An Imine&#8208;Linked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Reactive Oxygen Species Generator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2534-2540, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constituting imine linkages between trinuclear CuI&#8208;based complexes and diamine creates a metal&#8211;organic framework with honeycomb layers in eclipsed packing. Two kinds of structural vacancies are identified quantitatively by selective coordination dissociation. The structure could catalyze H2O2 decomposition and consequently excite O2 to reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
A new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with both coordination linkages and covalent linkages is prepared by coordinating CuI with pyrazolate for an aldehyde&#8208;functionalized trinuclear complex, and subsequent imine condensation with p&#8208;phenylenediamine, a reaction typical for covalent organic framework (COF) synthesis. This MOF&#215;COF collaboration yields FDM&#8208;71 with honeycomb layers stacked in eclipsed fashion. After dissociating the CuI&#8208;pyrazolate coordination in FDM&#8208;71, the obtained organic components carry the information of structural defects, and thus vacancy identity (aldehyde&#8208;based unit vacancy and amine&#8208;based unit vacancy) and concentration are definitely resolved. Further to the redox catalytic activity inherited from the complex, FDM&#8208;71 features effective photosensitizing activity. The two functions integrated in one well&#8208;defined structure is demonstrated by its high efficiency in decomposing H2O2 and consequent excitation of O2 to reactive oxygen species.

         <title>15N NMR Hyperpolarization of Radiosensitizing Antibiotic Nimorazole by Reversible Parahydrogen Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2406-2413, February 1, 2021. </description>

Synthesis of 15N3&#8208;enriched antibiotic and hypoxic radiosensitizer nimorazole is reported. Spin&#8208;relayed signal amplification by reversible exchange in microtesla magnetic field yielded up to 3.2&#8201;% 15N nuclear spin polarization with relaxation time constant of 5.9&#177;0.2&#8197;min at 1.4 T. The isomer of nimorazole formed in the synthesis was also hyperpolarized indicating that this approach can be extended to a wide range of nitroimidazole&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
Nimorazole belongs to the imidazole&#8208;based family of antibiotics to fight against anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, nimorazole is now in Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe for potential use as a hypoxia radiosensitizer for treatment of head and neck cancers. We envision the use of [15N3]nimorazole as a theragnostic hypoxia contrast agent that can be potentially deployed in the next&#8208;generation MRI&#8208;LINAC systems. Herein, we report the first steps to create long&#8208;lasting (for tens of minutes) hyperpolarized state on three 15N sites of [15N3]nimorazole with T1 of up to ca. 6&#8197;minutes. The nuclear spin polarization was boosted by ca. 67000&#8208;fold at 1.4 T (corresponding to P15N of 3.2&#8201;%) by 15N&#8722;15N spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization technique, relying on simultaneous exchange of [15N3]nimorazole and parahydrogen on polarization transfer Ir&#8208;IMes catalyst. The presented results pave the way to efficient spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization of a wide range of imidazole&#8208;based antibiotics and chemotherapeutics.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective (3+3) Cycloaddition of Nitrones with 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols Enabled by Cooperative Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2355-2363, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and enantioselective (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols has been established under the cooperative catalysis of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). This approach not only realized the first organocatalytic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones and the first C3&#8208;nucleophilic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols but also revealed a new mode of cooperative catalysis.







Abstract
The regio&#8208; and enantioselective (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols was accomplished by the cooperative catalysis of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). Using this approach, a series of indole&#8208;fused six&#8208;membered heterocycles were synthesized in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%), with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% ee) and exclusive regiospecificity. This approach enabled not only the first organocatalytic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones but also the first C3&#8208;nucleophilic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols. More importantly, theoretical calculations elucidated the role of the cocatalyst HFIP in helping CPA control the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the reaction, demonstrating a new mode of cooperative catalysis.

Compared with the donor&#8211;acceptor reference, the inserted oxygen atom between donor and acceptor can not only decrease hole&#8208;electron orbital overlap to suppress the charge transfer fluorescence, but also strengthen spin&#8208;orbital coupling effect to facilitate the intersystem crossing and subsequent phosphorescence channels. As a result, a significant RTP is observed in solid states under photo excitation. Most noticeably, the corresponding polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) reveal a dominant electrophosphorescence with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 9.7&#8201;%. The performance goes well beyond the 5&#8201;% theoretical limit for typical fluors, opening a new door to the development of pure organic RTP polymers towards efficient PLEDs.

         <title>How Oxygen Binding Enhances Long&#8208;Range Electron Transfer: Lessons From Reduction of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases by Cellobiose Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2385-2392, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interprotein electron&#8208;transfer (ET) mechanism between lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) and cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) was deciphered by multiscale simulations. Our simulations show that I)&#8197;the specific ET pathway involves water molecules; II)&#8197;the long&#8208;range ET is enhanced by exothermic oxygen binding; III)&#8197;enhanced ET is spin&#8208;regulated and favors the quartet state over the doublet state.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range electron transfer (ET) in metalloenzymes is a general and fundamental process governing O2 activation and reduction. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most commonly used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. We also show that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O2, directly leads to LPMO&#8722;CuII&#8722;O2&#8722;, bypassing the formation of the generally assumed LPMO&#8722;CuI species. The uncovered ET mechanism rationalizes experimental observations and might have far&#8208;reaching implications for LPMO catalysis as well as the O2&#8208; or CO&#8208;binding&#8208;enhanced long&#8208;range ET processes in other metalloenzymes.

         <title>In Situ Exploration of the Structural Transition during Morphology&#8208; and Efficiency&#8208;Conserving Halide Exchange on a Single Perovskite Nanocrystal</title>

In situ single&#8208;particle photoluminescence imaging revealed that sudden cooperative transition from green&#8208;emitting CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite nanocrystals to red&#8208;emitting CH3NH3PbBr3 while maintaining their morphology and emission efficiency during halide exchange. The transformation proceeds via intermediate dark states with &gt;100&#8197;s durations and originates from two distinct defect&#8208;mediated processes with different activation energies.







Abstract
Controlled fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures with unique physicochemical properties is vital for future technologies. In this study, transformation from red&#8208;emitting metal halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) to green&#8208;emitting CH3NH3PbBr3 NCs was achieved without significant morphological changes and loss of photoluminescence (PL) efficiency via a controlled halide exchange reaction. In situ single&#8208;particle PL imaging along with detailed structural and elemental characterizations revealed that sudden cooperative transitions between two light&#8208;emitting states via intermediate dark states with &gt;100&#8197;s durations during halide exchange originate from two distinct defect&#8208;mediated reconstruction processes with different activation energies (0.072 and 0.40&#8197;eV), leading to an isokinetic temperature of ca. 314&#8197;K, across a solid&#8208;state miscibility gap between the I&#8208; and Br&#8208;rich phases inside a single NC.

         <title>Directing the Rate&#8208;Enhancement for Hydronium Ion Catalyzed Dehydration via Organization of Alkanols in Nanoscopic Confinements</title>

The van der Waals stabilization of transition states in smaller&#8208;pore MFI zeolites makes secondary alcohols, 3&#8208;heptanol, and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol more reactive toward hydronium ion catalyzed elimination than in the sterically larger pore BEA zeolite. Whereas the stabilization of the C&#946;&#8208;H transition state provided by intraporous alcohol for 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol provides an additional stabilization in the sterically larger pore BEA zeolite, making hydronium ions in BEA more reactive than in MFI.







Abstract
Alkanol dehydration rates catalyzed by hydronium ions are enhanced by the dimensions of steric confinements of zeolite pores as well as by intraporous intermolecular interactions with other alkanols. The higher rates with zeolite MFI having pores smaller than those of zeolite BEA for dehydration of secondary alkanols, 3&#8208;heptanol and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol, is caused by the lower activation enthalpy in the tighter confinements of MFI that offsets a less positive activation entropy. The higher activity in BEA than in MFI for dehydration of a tertiary alkanol, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol, is primarily attributed to the reduction of the activation enthalpy by stabilizing intraporous interactions of the C&#946;&#8208;H transition state with surrounding alcohol molecules. Overall, we show that the positive impact of zeolite confinements results from the stabilization of transition state provided by the confinement and intermolecular interaction of alkanols with the transition state, which is impacted by both the size of confinements and the structure of alkanols in the E1 pathway of dehydration.

         <title>Light&#8208;Powered Autonomous Flagella&#8208;Like Motion of Molecular Crystal Microwires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2414-2423, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
When exposed to a combination of ultraviolet and visible light, crystalline microwires composed of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)allylidene)malononitrile ((Z)&#8208;DVAM) undergo oscillating deformations that mimic the motion of biological flagella and move the crystals through water. This life&#8208;like mechanical motion is fueled by reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization reactions taking place inside the crystal.







Abstract
The ability to exhibit life&#8208;like oscillatory motion fueled by light represents a new capability for stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Although this capability has been demonstrated in soft materials like polymers, it has never been observed in molecular crystals, which are not generally regarded as dynamic objects. In this work, it is shown that molecular crystalline microwires composed of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)allylidene)malononitrile ((Z)&#8208;DVAM) can be continuously actuated when exposed to a combination of ultraviolet and visible light. The photo&#8208;induced motion mimics the oscillatory behavior of biological flagella and enables propagation of microwires across a surface and through liquids, with translational speeds up to 7&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1. This is the first example of molecular crystals that show complex oscillatory behavior under continuous irradiation. A model that relates the rotation of the transition dipole moment between reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization to the microscopic torque can qualitatively reproduce how the rotational frequency depends on light intensity and polarization.

The photo&#8208;induced motion mimics the oscillatory behavior of biological flagella and enables propagation of microwires across a surface and through liquids, with translational speeds up to 7&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the first example of molecular crystals that show complex oscillatory behavior under continuous irradiation. A model that relates the rotation of the transition dipole moment between reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization to the microscopic torque can qualitatively reproduce how the rotational frequency depends on light intensity and polarization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A General Strategy to Design Highly Fluorogenic Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2393-2397, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palette of highly fluorogenic Huaxi&#8208;Fluor probes are turned on by a tetrazine bioorthogonal reaction. The emission wavelengths are fine&#8208;tuned from the far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared. These highly stable and biocompatible probes are suitable for visualizing organelles in live cells without a washing step and for imaging of tumors in live small animals to depths of 500&#8197;&#956;m by two&#8208;photon excitation.







Abstract
Highly fluorogenic tetrazine bioorthogonal probes emitting at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths are in strong demand for biomedical imaging applications. Herein, we have developed a strategy for forming a palette of novel Huaxi&#8208;Fluor probes in situ, whose fluorescence increases hundreds of times upon forming the bioorthogonal reaction product, pyridazine. The resulting probes show large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields. Manipulating the conjugate length and pull&#8211;push strength in the fluorophore skeleton allows the emission wavelength to be fine&#8208;tuned from 556 to 728&#8197;nm. The highly photo&#8208;stable and biocompatible probes are suitable for visualizing organelles in live cells without a washing step and for imaging of tumors in live small animals to depths of 500&#8197;&#956;m by two&#8208;photon excitation.

         <title>Stiffness Tomography of Ultra&#8208;Soft Nanogels by Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2280-2287, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely soft temperature&#8208;sensitive nanogels adsorbed to the solid/water interface were studied by atomic force microscopy. The ultra&#8208;soft nanogels disappeared in the classical 2D height image. By detailed analysis of Force Volume data the extraordinary disk&#8208;like and entirely homogeneous but extremely soft structure of the nanogels was resolved.







Abstract
The softness of nanohydrogels results in unique properties and recently attracted tremendous interest due to the multi&#8208;functionalization of interfaces. Herein, we study extremely soft temperature&#8208;sensitive ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;linked (ULC) nanogels adsorbed to the solid/water interface by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ultra&#8208;soft nanogels seem to disappear in classical imaging modes since a sharp tip fully penetrates these porous networks with very low forces in the range of steric interactions (ca.&#8197;100&#8197;pN). However, the detailed evaluation of Force Volume mode measurements allows us to resolve their overall shape and at the same time their internal structure in all three dimensions. The nanogels exhibit an extraordinary disk&#8208;like and entirely homogeneous but extremely soft structure&#8212;even softer than polymer brushes. Moreover, the temperature&#8208;sensitive nanogels can be switched on demand between the ultra&#8208;soft and a very stiff state.

         <title>Sub&#8208;3 nm Ultrafine Cu2O for Visible Light Driven Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2554-2560, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine Cu2O, less than 3&#8197;nm in size, was synthesized by facile in situ reduction of layered double hydroxide (LDH). This ultrafine Cu2O exhibits superior performance for visible light driven N2 reduction to NH3, with a nearly 64&#8208;fold increase in NH3 production rate compared to bulk Cu2O, and it is superior to most of the reported benchmark photocatalysts. The remarkable activity can be attributed to the availability of surface sites and the generation of long&#8208;lived photoexcited electrons.







Abstract
Cu2O, a low&#8208;cost, visible light responsive semiconductor photocatalyst represents an ideal candidate for visible light driven photocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, but it remains unexplored. Reported here is the successful synthesis of uniformly sized and ultrafine Cu2O platelets, with a lateral size of &lt;3&#8197;nm, by the in situ topotactic reduction of a CuII&#8208;containing layered double hydroxide with ascorbic acid. The supported ultrafine Cu2O offered excellent performance and stability for the visible light driven photocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 (the Cu2O&#8208;mass&#8208;normalized rate as high as 4.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g
&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#955;&gt;400&#8197;nm), with the origin of the high activity being long&#8208;lived photoexcited electrons in trap states, an abundance of exposed active sites, and the underlying support structure. This work guides the future design of ultrafine catalysts for NH3 synthesis and other applications.

         <title>The Trojan Horse Goes Wild: The Effect of Drug Loading on the Behavior of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2202-2206, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug delivery is often compared to a Trojan Horse, as the drugs are hidden inside nanoparticles (equivalent to the Trojan Horse) and they enter cells (e.g. cancer cells) in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. However, it seems that drug loading can influence the properties of the nanoparticles, which are detected by the cell. As a result, the cell can reject the nanoparticle; thus, loading large amounts of drugs can be damaging to drug delivery efforts.







Abstract
Drug delivery with nanoparticles is sometimes compared to an attack with a Trojan Horse. The drugs are hidden in nanoparticles and enter the unsuspecting cells in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. Here, I would like to share my thoughts that a comparison to the Trojan Horse does not always apply, and provide examples where an increased drug loading content was detrimental to the drug&#8208;delivery process. The purpose is to highlight the importance of understanding the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, and the importance of having materials scientists in the line&#8208;up of researchers working together to create successful nanomedicine.

Organic crystal microwires that transform light into oscillatory motion are reported by Rabih&#8197;O. Al&#8208;Kaysi, Christopher&#8197;J. Bardeen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;2414. A diolefinanthracene derivative undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization to generate molecular&#8208;scale motion. When microwires composed of this molecule are exposed to UV and visible wavelengths, forward and reverse reactions drive continuous twisting and writhing. These motions can propel the wires at speeds controlled by the light intensity.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are important for the construction of molecular switches or sensors. In their Research Article on page&#8197;2330, Mateusz Reczy&#324;ski, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi, Beata Nowicka, and co&#8208;workers present room&#8208;temperature bistability in a CN&#8208;bridged Ni&#8211;Fe coordination chain, which exhibits multiresponsive behavior with electron&#8208;transfer transitions induced by temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. The material responds to these stimuli with measurable changes in magnetic properties and color.

Smart design of nanotherapeutics: Mitochondria play pivotal roles in regulating cell survival and death. They have become important targets in organelle&#8208;targeted therapy. This Review highlights a collection of the latest advances in the design strategies of multifunctional mitochondria&#8208;targeted nanotherapeutics.







Abstract
Mitochondria are the powerhouse of cells. They are vital organelles that maintain cellular function and metabolism. Dysfunction of mitochondria results in various diseases with a great diversity of clinical appearances. In the past, strategies have been developed for fabricating subcellular&#8208;targeting drug&#8208;delivery nanocarriers, enabling cellular internalization and subsequent organelle localization. Of late, innovative strategies have emerged for the smart design of multifunctional nanocarriers. Hierarchical targeting enables nanocarriers to evade and overcome various barriers encountered upon in vivo administration to reach the organelle with good bioavailability. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers allow controlled release of therapeutics to occur at the desired target site. Synergistic therapy can be achieved using a combination of approaches such as chemotherapy, gene and phototherapy. In this Review, we survey the field for recent developments and strategies used in the smart design of nanocarriers for mitochondria&#8208;targeted therapeutics. Existing challenges and unexplored therapeutic opportunities are also highlighted and discussed to inspire the next generation of mitochondrial&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutics.

Clues from the recent literature have been used to unravel a series of mechanistic puzzles regarding the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents. Four examples are highlighted that will change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced.







Abstract
While writing a comprehensive review on the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents, we encountered a series of mechanistic puzzles. Using clues from the literature, many of which were not available at the time that the mysteries emerged, it was possible to demystify a number of these conundrums. We discuss four examples, which we believe will significantly change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced. Our experience underscores the importance of comprehensive and critical reviews in chemistry and the truism that the authors are prime beneficiaries of the review process.

         <title>Nucleic Acid Aptamers for Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2221-2231, February 1, 2021. </description>

Advantages of aptamers and SELEX in diverse research fields are summarized in this Minireview, along with some limitations and possible solutions to them. Furthermore described are future perspectives for aptamer modification with a near&#8208;infinite number of molecular&#8208;modulating elements that will result in more powerful tools in bioscience.







Abstract
The advent of SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technology has shown the ability to evolve artificial ligands with affinity and specificity able to meet growing clinical demand for probes that can, for example, distinguish between the target leukemia cells and other cancer cells within the matrix of heterogeneity, which characterizes cancer cells. Though antibodies are the conventional and ideal choice as a molecular recognition tool for many applications, aptamers complement the use of antibodies due to many unique advantages, such as small size, low cost, and facile chemical modification. This Minireview will focus on the novel applications of aptamers and SELEX, as well as opportunities to develop molecular tools able to meet future clinical needs in biomedicine.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of Layered Lithium&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2208-2220, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered lithium&#8208;rich materials are promising cathode materials for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Understanding the principles of the performance degradation mechanisms is a prerequisite for progress in this area. In this Minireview, recent research on the material structure and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials is discussed.







Abstract
Layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interest owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320&#8211;350&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, interest in layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials is expected to revive in answer to our increasing dependence on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we review recent research progress and in&#8208;depth descriptions of the structure characterization and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarize the proposed reaction mechanisms of both the cationic redox reaction of transition&#8208;metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges facing the future development of lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Unlocking Nature's Biosynthetic Power&#8212;Metabolic Engineering for the Fermentative Production of Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2258-2278, February 1, 2021. </description>

Recent advances and future perspectives in microbial metabolic engineering are described in this Review, with a focus on selected commercially relevant examples. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products can now be easily discovered and optimized to enable competitive production processes. Moreover, nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways can now be rearranged to yield novel biosynthetic routes.







Abstract
Fermentation as a production method for chemicals is especially attractive, as it is based on cheap renewable raw materials and often exhibits advantages in terms of costs and sustainability. The tremendous development of technology in bioscience has resulted in an exponentially increasing knowledge about biological systems and has become the main driver for innovations in the field of metabolic engineering. Progress in recombinant DNA technology, genomics, and computational methods open new, cheaper, and faster ways to metabolically engineer microorganisms. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products, such as vitamins, organic acids, amino acids, or secondary metabolites, can be discovered and optimized efficiently, thereby enabling competitive commercial production processes. Novel biosynthetic routes can now be designed by the rearrangement of nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways in microbial strains. This expands the range of chemicals accessible by biotechnology and has yielded the first commercial products, while new fermentation technologies targeting novel active ingredients, commodity chemicals, and CO2&#8208;fixation methods are on the horizon.

Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) precursor salt 2BF4 reacts with [M(PPh3)4] (M=Pd, Pt) to give cis/trans&#8208;[3]BF4 and cis&#8208;[4]BF4, in which the CAAC ligand bears an unusual N&#8208;alkyl substituent. trans&#8208;[5] has a unique anionic CAAC ligand with an unsubstituted ring&#8208;nitrogen atom which can be protonated to give trans&#8208;[6]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC (pCAAC) ligand.







Abstract
CAAC precursors 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindole 1 and 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindolium tetrafluoroborate 2BF4 have been prepared and oxidatively added to [M(PPh3)4] (M=Pd, Pt). Salt 2BF4 reacts with [Pd(PPh3)4] in toluene at 25&#8201;&#176;C over 4&#8197;days to yield complex cis&#8208;[3]BF4 featuring an N&#8208;ethyl substituted CAAC, two cis&#8208;arranged phosphines and a chloro ligand. Compound trans&#8208;[3]BF4 was obtained from the same reaction at 80&#8201;&#176;C over 1&#8197;day. Salt 2BF4 reacts with [Pt(PPh3)4] to give cis&#8208;[4]BF4. The neutral indole derivative 1 adds oxidatively to [Pt(PPh3)4] to give trans&#8208;[5] featuring a CAAC ligand with an unsubstituted ring&#8208;nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom has been protonated with py&#8901;HBF4 to give trans&#8208;[6]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC ligand. The PdII complex trans&#8208;[7]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC ligand was obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction from 1 and [Pd(PPh3)4] in the presence of py&#8901;HBF4.

The neutral indole derivative &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; adds oxidatively to [Pt(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] to give trans&#8208;[&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;] featuring a CAAC ligand with an unsubstituted ring&#8208;nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom has been protonated with py&#8901;HBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to give trans&#8208;[&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; bearing a protic CAAC ligand. The Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex trans&#8208;[&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; bearing a protic CAAC ligand was obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and [Pd(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] in the presence of py&#8901;HBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes with Cobalt Homoenolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2694-2698, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for highly atom&#8208;economical, efficient, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes promoted by an easily accessible Co complex was developed. This protocol is the first example of introduction of a wide range of Co homoenolates generated from ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropanols to the cyclopropanes.







Abstract
Catalylic diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with Co&#8208;homoenolate generated in&#8197;situ from ring&#8208;opening of easily accessible cyclopropanols promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such a process represents the unprecedented and direct introduction of a wide range of functionalized alkyl groups without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents onto the cyclopropane motif, affording multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in up to 99&#8201;% yield with &gt;95:5 dr and 98:2 er. Functionalization of the products delivered enantioenriched cyclopropanes that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Large&#8208;Amplitude Conformational Changes in Self&#8208;Assembled Multi&#8208;Stranded Aromatic Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2574-2577, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected conformational changes involving a global concerted rearrangement of the structure have been evidenced in large multistranded aromatic sheets. Increasing foldamer size thus gives access to new and defined conformational trajectories.







Abstract
The orchestration of ever larger conformational changes is made possible by the development of increasingly complex foldamers. Aromatic sheets, a rare motif in synthetic foldamer structures, have been designed so as to form discrete stacks of intercalated aromatic strands through the self&#8208;assembly of two identical subunits. Ion&#8208;mobility ESI&#8208;MS confirms the formation of compact dimers. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals the existence of two distinct conformational dimeric states that require large changes to interconvert. Molecular dynamics simulation validates the stability of the two conformations and the possibility of their interconversion.

         <title>Extended Multicomponent Reactions with Indole Aldehydes: Access to Unprecedented Polyheterocyclic Scaffolds, Ligands of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2603-2608, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engaging indole aldehydes in an isocyanide multicomponent reaction, the polarity inversion of the indole moiety along the transformation triggers an extension of the domino process, leading to a variety of unprecedented fused, linked, and bridged scaffolds. The processes can be run in parallel and the adducts display remarkable bioactivity as potent ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.







Abstract
The participation of reactants undergoing a polarity inversion along a multicomponent reaction allows the continuation of the transformation with productive domino processes. Thus, indole aldehydes in Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; reactions lead to an initial adduct which spontaneously triggers a series of events leading to the discovery of novel reaction pathways together with direct access to a variety of linked, fused, and bridged polyheterocyclic scaffolds. Indole 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;carbaldehydes with suitable isocyanides and aminoazines afford fused adducts through oxidative Pictet&#8211;Spengler processes, whereas indole 2&#8208;carbaldehyde yields linked indolocarbazoles under mild conditions, and a bridged macrocycle at high temperature. These novel structures are potent activators of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway.

         <title>A Diarylacetonitrile as a Molecular Probe for the Detection of Polymeric Mechanoradicals in the Bulk State through a Radical Chain&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2680-2683, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent molecular probe that functions as a scavenger of polymeric mechanoradicals was developed (see picture), and its fluorescence intensity was found to increase with increasing generation of radicals in the bulk. This probe enables the optical visualization and quantitative evaluation of polymeric radicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission of polymers that do not contain mechanophores.







Abstract
Since the beginning of polymer science, understanding the influence of mechanical stress on polymer chains has been a fundamental and important research topic. The detection of mechanoradicals generated by homolytic cleavage of the polymer chains in solution has been studied in many cases. However, the detection of mechanoradicals in the bulk is still limited owing to their high reactivity. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy to detect mechanoradicals visually and quantitatively using a chain&#8208;transfer agent that generates relatively stable fluorescent radicals as a molecular probe. Mechanoradicals generated by ball milling of polystyrene samples were successfully detected by using a diarylacetonitrile compound as a fluorescent molecular probe through this radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism. This probe enables the visualization and quantitative evaluation of mechanoradicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission.

Mild C&#8722;C bond formation processes via ring&#8208;opening of oxetanes by soft carbon nucleophiles are described. These allow access to useful 1,n&#8208;oxygenated molecules and heterocycles. 







Abstract
Mild oxetane opening by soft carbon nucleophiles has been developed for efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. In the presence of LiNTf2 or TBSNTf2 as catalyst, silyl ketene acetals were found to be effective nucleophiles to generate a wide range of highly oxygenated molecules, which are key substructure in natural products like polyketides. Furthermore, intramolecular oxetane opening by a styrene&#8208;based carbon nucleophile via a Prins&#8208;type process was also achieved with Sc(OTf)3 as catalyst, leading to efficient formation of the useful 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[b]oxepine skeleton.

         <title>Exploring the Organometallic Route to Molecular Spin Qubits: The&#8201;[CpTi(cot)] Case</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2588-2593, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin coherence of the sandwich complex [CpTi(cot)] survives for tens of &#956;s at low temperature despite the presence of hydrogen atoms. This stems from its electronic structure and spin&#8208;vibrational properties, investigated by ab initio calculations and terahertz spectroscopy. This evaporable molecule with d
 singly occupied orbital is a promising candidate for a coherent spin qubit and for single spin addressing.







Abstract
The coherence time of the 17&#8208;electron, mixed sandwich complex [CpTi(cot)], (&#951;8&#8208;cyclooctatetraene)(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)titanium, reaches 34&#8197;&#956;s at 4.5&#8197;K in a frozen deuterated toluene solution. This is a remarkable coherence time for a highly protonated molecule. The intramolecular distances between the Ti and H atoms provide a good compromise between instantaneous and spin diffusion sources of decoherence. Ab initio calculations at the molecular and crystal packing levels reveal that the characteristic low&#8208;energy ring rotations of the sandwich framework do not yield a too detrimental spin&#8208;lattice relaxation because of their small spin&#8211;phonon coupling. The volatility of [CpTi(cot)] and the accessibility of the semi&#8208;occupied, non&#8208;bonding d
 orbital make this neutral compound an ideal candidate for single&#8208;qubit addressing on surface and quantum sensing in combination with scanning probe microscopy.

         <title>Reactivity, Selectivity, and Synthesis of 4&#8208;C&#8208;Silylated Glycosyl Donors and 4&#8208;Deoxy Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2689-2693, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 4&#8208;C&#8208;silylated glycosyl donors have been synthesized starting from cellulose. This new class of donors showed remarkably similar selectivity to and modestly more reactivity than their 4&#8208;C&#8208;deoxy analogue, allowing for very mild glycosylation reaction conditions and short reaction times.







Abstract
A method for introducing dimethylphenylsilyl at the 4&#8208;position in carbohydrates has been developed. Two C&#8208;silylated glycosyl donors were prepared via levoglucosenone, starting from cellulose. The glycosylation properties were studied using three glucoside acceptors, a 3&#8208;OH, 4&#8208;OH, and 6&#8208;OH. Compared with the 4&#8208;deoxy variant, it was found that the anomeric selectivity was influenced more by the C&#8208;2 substituents orientation than the silyl in the 4&#8208;position. In general, the reactivity of these donors was higher than the corresponding 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;analogue, albeit a competition experiment showed that the introduction of a C&#8722;Si increases the relative reactivity by a modest factor of around two.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective 1,2&#8208;Arylfluorination of Internal Enamides</title>

The palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular oxidative 1,2&#8208;arylfluorination of internal enamides is reported. The removable oxazolidinone group enabled the highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective formation of &#946;&#8208;fluoroamine derivatives containing vicinal stereocenters with broad substrate scope under mild conditions.







Abstract
We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of internal enamides, arylboronic acids, and Selectfluor to access the chiral &#946;&#8208;fluoroaminated moiety with up to 99&#8201;% ee. The prefunctionalized oxazolidinone substituted alkene enables the expedient construction of two vicinal stereocenters with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. The synthetic application is exhibited by selective transformation of the product into various vicinal benzylic fluoride derivatives.

         <title>Boranyl&#8208;Functionalized [Ge9] Clusters: Providing the Idea of Intramolecular Ge/B Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>

Upon reaction of silylated [Ge9] clusters with 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolidines boranyl&#8208;functionalization is achieved. The presented experiments aim for the generation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs as predicted from quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.







Abstract
The unique three&#8208;dimensional structure of spherical, homoatomic nine&#8208;atom germanium clusters opens various possibilities for the spatial arrangement of functional groups. Ligands comprising lone pairs have recently been introduced in the cluster sphere, and we now report the addition of a boranyl group to the cluster featuring a Ge&#8722;B exo&#8208;cluster bond. The reaction of the twofold&#8208;silylated cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; (TMS=trimethylsilyl) with 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolidines DABR&#8208;Cl leads to the first boranyl&#8208;functionalized [Ge9] clusters [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2DABR]&#8722; (R=methyl (1&#8201;a), iso&#8208;propyl (2&#8201;a), ortho&#8208;tolyl (3&#8201;a)). The anions 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a were structurally characterized as [NHCDippCu]+ complexes (NHCDipp=1,3&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidine) through single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations manifest the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) character of the boranyl&#8208;functionalized cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2BCy2]&#8722; (4&#8201;a).

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer&#8208;Based Smart Prodrug Delivery System for Specific Targeting, Prolonged Retention, and Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Triggered Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2663-2667, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based smart prodrug delivery nanoplatform was demonstrated with the ability to specifically target tumor sites with prolonged retention time and gradual tumor microenvironmental pH&#8208;triggered release. The MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent, which not only greatly enhances tumor specificity but also expands the scope of applicable prodrugs.







Abstract
Prodrug and drug delivery systems are two effective strategies for improving the selectivity of chemotherapeutics. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have emerged as promising carriers in targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment, but they have not yet been integrated with the prodrug strategy. Reported here is an MIP&#8208;based smart prodrug delivery system for specific targeting, prolonged retention time, and tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered release. 5&#8242;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluorocytidine (DFCR) and sialic acid (SA) were used as a prodrug and a marker for tumor targeting, respectively. Their co&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were prepared as a smart carrier. Prodrug&#8208;loaded MIP specifically and sustainably accumulated at the tumor site and then gradually released. Unlike conventional prodrug designs, which often require in&#8208;liver bioconversion, this MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent. Thus, this study opens new access to the development of smart prodrug delivery nanoplatforms.

     alt="Molecularly Imprinted Polymer&#8208;Based Smart Prodrug Delivery System for Specific Targeting, Prolonged Retention, and Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Triggered Release"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based smart prodrug delivery nanoplatform was demonstrated with the ability to specifically target tumor sites with prolonged retention time and gradual tumor microenvironmental pH&#8208;triggered release. The MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent, which not only greatly enhances tumor specificity but also expands the scope of applicable prodrugs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodrug and drug delivery systems are two effective strategies for improving the selectivity of chemotherapeutics. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have emerged as promising carriers in targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment, but they have not yet been integrated with the prodrug strategy. Reported here is an MIP&#8208;based smart prodrug delivery system for specific targeting, prolonged retention time, and tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered release. 5&#8242;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluorocytidine (DFCR) and sialic acid (SA) were used as a prodrug and a marker for tumor targeting, respectively. Their co&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were prepared as a smart carrier. Prodrug&#8208;loaded MIP specifically and sustainably accumulated at the tumor site and then gradually released. Unlike conventional prodrug designs, which often require in&#8208;liver bioconversion, this MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent. Thus, this study opens new access to the development of smart prodrug delivery nanoplatforms.&lt;/p&gt;

Azetidines can be enantioselectively prepared from the title compounds and various 1&#8208;arylethenes. An intramolecular variant of the reaction is also possible, and the lactam ring of the products 1 can be readily cleaved without loss of enantiopurity.







Abstract
3&#8208;Substituted quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and various aryl&#8208;substituted or tethered olefins underwent an enantioselective, inter&#8208; or intramolecular aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction upon irradiation at &#955;=420&#8197;nm in the presence of a chiral sensitizer (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%). For the intermolecular reaction with 1&#8208;arylethenes as olefin components, the scope of the reaction was studied (14 examples, 50&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 86&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). The absolute and relative configuration of the products were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reaction is suggested to occur by triplet energy transfer in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1:1 complex between the imine substrate and the catalyst. The intramolecular cycloaddition, consecutive reactions of the product azetidines, and an alternative reaction mode of quinoxalinones were investigated in preliminary experiments.

         <title>A Tubular DNA Nanodevice as a siRNA/Chemo&#8208;Drug Co&#8208;delivery Vehicle for Combined Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2594-2598, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autonomous tubular DNA nanodevice is constructed to deliver a chemotherapeutic drug and siRNAs. This nanodevice can realize on&#8208;demand targeting, respond to stimuli in the intracellular environment and release multiple molecular payloads for combined antitumor activity.







Abstract
Using the DNA origami technique, we constructed a DNA nanodevice functionalized with small interfering RNA (siRNA) within its inner cavity and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX), intercalated in the DNA duplexes. The incorporation of disulfide bonds allows the triggered mechanical opening and release of siRNA in response to intracellular glutathione (GSH) in tumors to knockdown genes key to cancer progression. Combining RNA interference and chemotherapy, the nanodevice induced potent cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition, without observable systematic toxicity. Given its autonomous behavior, exceptional designability, potent antitumor activity and marked biocompatibility, this DNA nanodevice represents a promising strategy for precise drug design for cancer therapy.

         <title>Insights into the Topology and the Formation of a Genuine pp&#963; Bond: Experimental and Computed Electron Densities in Monoanionic Trichlorine [Cl3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2569-2573, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the 3c&#8211;4e bond of a symmetric trichlorine anion [Cl]&#8722; was characterized by experimental charge density investigations and compared to two asymmetric cases. Quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations for both periodic crystals and isolated molecules/ions flank those studies. There appears to be a smooth transition from the asymmetric to the symmetric compound.







Abstract
So far, several publications have discussed the bonding concepts in polyhalides on a theoretical basis. In particular, the trichlorine monoanion is of great interest because its structure should be symmetrical and show two equidistant Cl&#8722;Cl bonds. However, apart from matrix&#8208;isolation studies, only asymmetric trichlorine anions have been reported so far. Herein, the trichlorine monoanions in 2&#8208;chloroethyltrimethylammonium trichloride [NMe3EtCl][Cl3], 1, tetramethylammonium trichloride [NMe4][Cl3], 2, and tetrapropylammonium trichloride [NnPr4][Cl3], 3, are analysed. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures and experimental charge density analyses supported by periodic quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into the influence of the crystalline environment on the structure of these [Cl3]&#8722; anions as well as into the progress of the bond formation between a dichlorine molecule and a Cl&#8722; anion.

         <title>Evidence of a Phenolic Pool as a Key Intermediate for Zeolite&#8208;Catalyzed Lignin Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2643-2647, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first real&#8208;time experimental observation and speciation of a phenolic pool is reported. The phenolic pool, which features equidistant grouping&#8208;distribution patterns, originates from the repolymerization of monomeric units and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke.







Abstract
The phenolic pool is considered to be an important intermediate during the catalytic conversion of biomass. However, no direct evidence has been reported on its full picture on a molecular level due to the huge challenges in probing the reactive and lowly volatile phenolic oligomers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. Herein, we report the online detection and structural identification of a phenolic pool by utilizing in&#8208;situ atmospheric&#8208;pressure photoionization mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the phenolic pool is formed through repolymerization of monomers with an equidistant group pattern and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke. The exploration of the real reactive species is also of great importance for the rational design and synthesis of advanced catalysts with high activity.

         <title>A Coplanar &#960;&#8208;Extended Quinoxaline Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Material Enabling over 21&#8201;% Efficiency for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2674-2679, February 1, 2021. </description>

Quinoxaline derivatives, featuring with rotatable and chemically fixed thienyl substitutes, are introduced as the core for constructing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). The coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline&#8208;based HTM TQ4 achieves the best photovoltaic performance (exceed 21&#8201;%) among planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured dopant&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

&lt;p&gt;Quinoxaline derivatives, featuring with rotatable and chemically fixed thienyl substitutes, are introduced as the core for constructing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). The coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline&#8208;based HTM &lt;b&gt;TQ4&lt;/b&gt; achieves the best photovoltaic performance (exceed 21&#8201;%) among planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured dopant&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs are scarce. Herein, we improve the performance of dopant&#8208;free HTMs featuring with a quinoxaline core via rational &#960;&#8208;extension. Upon incorporating rotatable or chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the pyrazine ring, the resulting molecular HTMs &lt;b&gt;TQ3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TQ4&lt;/b&gt; show completely different molecular arrangement as well as charge transporting capabilities. Comparing with &lt;b&gt;TQ3&lt;/b&gt;, the coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline based &lt;b&gt;TQ4&lt;/b&gt; endows enriched intermolecular interactions and stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thus achieving a higher hole mobility of 2.08&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) encapsulation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives could provide a bench&#8208;top&#8208;storable format for BCP derivatives. Furthermore, simple protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP were developed to afford [1.1.1]propellane. Together, these findings provided novel and simple methodology for on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in a wide range of solvents (protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar) under mild conditions.







Abstract
The bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) scaffold is useful in medicinal chemistry, and many protocols are available for synthesizing BCP derivatives from [1.1.1]propellane. Here, we report (1)&#8197;the &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) encapsulation of BCP derivatives, affording a stable, readily storable material from which BCPs can be easily and quantitatively recovered and (2)&#8197;new and simple protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP to afford [1.1.1]propellane in protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar solvents. The combination of these methodologies enables simple, on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in various solvents under mild conditions from &#945;&#8208;CD capsules containing 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP.

         <title>A Stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene with a 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Ferrocenediyl Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2624-2628, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cyclic diaminosilylene featuring a ferrocene&#8208;based backbone is reported. The dicoordinate SiII atom is part of a six&#8208;membered FeC2N2Si ring and shows a comparatively large bond angle of ca. 107&#176;. This N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene can activate strong bonds (C=O, N=O, B&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, P&#8722;H, O&#8722;H) under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene [{Fe(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4&#8208;NDipp)2}Si] (1DippSi, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) shows an excellent combination of pronounced thermal stability and high reactivity towards small molecules. It reacts readily with CO2 and N2O, respectively affording (1DippSiO2)2C and (1DippSiO)2 as follow&#8208;up products of the silanone 1DippSiO. Its reactions with H2O, NH3, and FcPH2 (Fc=ferrocenyl) furnish the respective oxidative addition products 1DippSi(H)X (X=OH, NH2, PHFc). Its reaction with H3BNH3 unexpectedly results in B&#8722;H, instead of N&#8722;H, bond activation, affording 1DippSi(H)(BH2NH3). DFT results suggest that dramatically different mechanisms are operative for these H&#8722;X insertions.

         <title>Dinuclear Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates Composed of Tetradentate Ligands with Aluminum(III) Chromophores: Optical Resolution and Multi&#8208;color Circularly Polarized Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2614-2618, February 1, 2021. </description>

In a set of chiroptical chromophores, dinuclear triple&#8208;stranded helicates, based on tetradentate ligands and AlIII ions, the right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization. They show multi&#8208;color emission with mirror&#8208;image circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solution and the solid&#8208;state. A mixture of different helicates produces white&#8208;light emission with CPL character.







Abstract
New chiroptical chromophores, dinuclear triple&#8208;stranded helicates, composed of tetradentate ligands with aluminum(III) ions, are described. These are synthesized in two steps using inexpensive pyrrole derivatives, hydrazine, and aluminum chloride. These molecular architectures (ALPHY) show multi&#8208;color (cyan, yellow, and orange) photoluminescence in solution and in the solid&#8208;state, which depends on the substituents of the ligands. The photoluminescence quantum yields of helicates were up to 54&#8201;%. The right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization in some solvents and are mirror images according to circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an absolute luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of up to the 10&#8722;3 order. Mixing the different helicates produces white&#8208;light emission with CPL characters. This study offers a glimpse into the potential applications of chromophores with diverse photophysical properties.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Extraction of Bioreceptors into Polymeric Membranes for Label&#8208;Free Potentiometric Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2609-2613, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric sensing system was designed to achieve the direct potentiometric sensing of analytes based on hydrophilic bioreceptors. The magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven extraction of bioreceptors into polymeric membranes enables label&#8208;free and indicator&#8208;free potentiometric biosensing of a broad range of different target molecules.







Abstract
We report here the concept of a magnetically controlled extraction of hydrophilic bioreceptors into polymeric membranes for bioassays. The potentiometric assay relies on the intrinsic charges of an antimicrobial peptide and its unique recognition abilities, which can eliminate the probe labeling and indicator addition. The target binding event could effectively prevent the extraction of the peptide into the polymeric membrane doped with an ion exchanger, thus resulting in a potential change. The potentiometric response properties of the peptide assembled on magnetic beads can be dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field. Staphylococcus aureus, as a model of food&#8208;borne pathogens, was measured at levels down to 10&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Based on this sensing strategy, a potentiometric array was developed for the pattern recognition of bacteria.

     alt="Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Extraction of Bioreceptors into Polymeric Membranes for Label&#8208;Free Potentiometric Biosensing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric sensing system was designed to achieve the direct potentiometric sensing of analytes based on hydrophilic bioreceptors. The magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven extraction of bioreceptors into polymeric membranes enables label&#8208;free and indicator&#8208;free potentiometric biosensing of a broad range of different target molecules.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report here the concept of a magnetically controlled extraction of hydrophilic bioreceptors into polymeric membranes for bioassays. The potentiometric assay relies on the intrinsic charges of an antimicrobial peptide and its unique recognition abilities, which can eliminate the probe labeling and indicator addition. The target binding event could effectively prevent the extraction of the peptide into the polymeric membrane doped with an ion exchanger, thus resulting in a potential change. The potentiometric response properties of the peptide assembled on magnetic beads can be dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field. Staphylococcus aureus, as a model of food&#8208;borne pathogens, was measured at levels down to 10&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on this sensing strategy, a potentiometric array was developed for the pattern recognition of bacteria. The proposed general platform can be used for potentiometric biosensing using other hydrophilic bioreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid Unperturbed&#8208;Tissue Analysis for Intraoperative Cancer Diagnosis Using an Enzyme&#8208;Activated NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe</title>

A matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid unperturbed&#8208;tissue analysis for ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo neuroblastoma diagnosis. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobe a suitable rapid diagnostic reagent for cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.







Abstract
Accurate intraoperative tissue identification is critical to tumor surgery. However, conventional methods are labor&#8208; and time&#8208;intensive, which greatly delay the intraoperative decision&#8208;making. Herein, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid unperturbed&#8208;tissue analysis for ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo neuroblastoma diagnosis. A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P displays negligible fluorescence in normal tissues but is activated quickly by inhibiting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Ag2S QDs and A1094 mediated by MMP14 overexpressed in neuroblastoma; meanwhile, the exposure of the membrane penetrating peptide R9 (TAT&#8208;peptide) results in efficient internalization of nanoprobes in the cancer cells, providing superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) tissue ratio. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobes a suitable rapid diagnostic reagent for cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.

         <title>Synthesis of a Sidewall Fragment of a (12,0) Carbon Nanotube</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2658-2662, February 1, 2021. </description>

A highly strained carbon nanobelt (CNB) containing an octabenzo[12]cyclacene unit was synthesized and isolated in a single crystal form. It shows local aromaticity and highly shielded chemical environment in the cavity. Benzo&#8208;annulation and phenyl substitution are crucial to the successful synthesis of this CNB.







Abstract
Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt (CNB) is a very challenging task in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of an octabenzo[12]cyclacene based CNB (6), which can be regarded as a sidewall fragment of a (12,0) carbon nanotube. The key intermediate compound, a tetraepoxy nanobelt (5), was first synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and subsequent reductive aromatization gave the fully conjugated CNB 6. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis unambiguously confirmed the belt&#8208;shaped structure of 6. 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum and theoretical calculations (ACID, NICS, and 2D/3D ICSS) revealed localized aromaticity and stronger shielding chemical environment in the inner region of the belt. The optical properties (absorption and emission) of 6 were studied and correlated to its electronic structure. Strain analysis indicates that the phenyl substituents at the zigzag edges are crucial to the successful synthesis of 6. This report presents a new strategy towards highly strained CNBs.

         <title>An Open Microfluidic Chip for Continuous Sampling of Solute from a Turbulent Particle Suspension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2654-2657, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open microfluidic chip for aqueous phase sampling from high&#8208;solids content turbulent slurries is demonstrated for mineral processing and pharmaceutical tablet dissolution slurries. The chip's 25&#8197;&#956;m slit dampens turbulence in the outside fluid and allows partial exchange of inner and outer fluids, without entraining microparticles (&gt;1&#8197;&#956;m). The microfluidic flow profile, not size&#8208;exclusion, enables the selective sampling of aqueous phase.







Abstract
High solids content complicates in&#8197;situ analysis of chemical processing, biological suspensions, and environmental streams. In most cases, analytical methods require at least one pre&#8208;treatment step of a small volume of sample before a particle&#8208;free fluid can be analyzed. We have developed a continuous in&#8197;situ sampler that can &#8220;sip&#8221; particle&#8208;free solution from a turbulent high solids content stream (a slurry). An open microfluidic chip with an extended slit opening shields the internal laminar flow from the turbulence outside. Unlike other open chips, our chip does not require close proximity to a solid surface and operates in turbulent environments for hours without maintenance. Two applications are demonstrated: monitoring FeIII in a stirred slurry of mixed ore particles at high solids loading (4&#8201;%wt) and paracetamol tablet dissolution profiles for two different formulations.

The chemoselective cleavage of an arene ring in biphenylene is reported using an aluminum(I) complex. The reaction proceeds with complete integrity of the central four&#8208;membered ring despite this ring containing the weakest C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond in the hydrocarbon scaffold.







Abstract
The chemoselective cleavage of a six&#8208;membered aromatic ring in biphenylene is reported using an aluminum(I) complex. This type of selectivity is unprecedented. In every example of transition metal mediated C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond activation reported to date, the reaction occurs at the central four&#8208;membered ring of biphenylene. Insight into the origin of chemoselectivity was obtained through a detailed mechanistic analysis (isolation of an intermediate, DFT studies, activation strain analysis). In conclusion, the divergent reactivity can be attributed to differences in both the symmetry and radial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals of the aluminum(I) fragment compared to that of common transition metal fragments.

         <title>Overcoming the Anisotropic Growth Limitations of Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2629-2636, February 1, 2021. </description>

It is challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films with large lateral size and much thinner thickness. A surface energy modifying strategy was proposed that achieves anisotropic growth, freestanding single&#8208;crystal CsPbBr3 halide perovskite films with a thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to one centimeter.







Abstract
It is extremely challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films (SCHPFs) with not only desired transport properties but also large lateral size with much thinner thickness. Here, we report the growth of freestanding single crystal CsPbBr3 SCHPFs with thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to centimeter for the first time. A new model for growth kinetics (&#936;=Aexp[&#8722;(EA&#8722;Es)/(kBT)]) is proposed to address the surface energy and temperature effect on the growth rate of ultrathin CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal film.

&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films with large lateral size and much thinner thickness. A surface energy modifying strategy was proposed that achieves anisotropic growth, freestanding single&#8208;crystal CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; halide perovskite films with a thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to one centimeter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films (SCHPFs) with not only desired transport properties but also large lateral size with much thinner thickness. Here, we report the growth of freestanding single crystal CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SCHPFs with thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to centimeter for the first time. A new model for growth kinetics (&#936;=Aexp[&#8722;(E&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)/(k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T)]) is proposed to address the surface energy and temperature effect on the growth rate of ultrathin CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single&#8208;crystal film. The experimental results and DFT calculations both demonstrated that the surfactant plays a critical role in modifying the surface energy and achieving anisotropic growth. This work opens new opportunities for high&#8208;quality SCHPFs with large lateral size and controllable thickness that may find wide applications for optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Photoluminescence Tuning in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead Bromide Trimer Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2583-2587, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;trapped exciton emission of zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide, (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium), is delicately varied via a high pressure technique. Through the pressure&#8208;induced structural distortion, a clear change of emission color, intense white&#8208;light emission and the corresponding variation in structure&#8211;property relationships are achieved.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides are promising light emitters. However, it is still challenging to accurately design their structures with targeted photoluminescence properties. Herein, high pressure is used to change the self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission of 0D (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium). Under initial compression, the simultaneous contraction and distortion of photoactive [Pb3Br11]5&#8722; vary the equilibrium of STE emissions between different excited states, tuning the emission color from yellow green to cyan. Notably, sufficient structural distortion under continuous compression leads to the formation of more and deeper STE states, exhibiting an unprecedented broadband white&#8208;light emission. This study reveals the structure&#8208;dependent optical properties of 0D hybrid metal halides, providing novel insights into the mechanism of STE emission.

         <title>A Palette of Minimally&#8208;Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sucrose is the main saccharide transported in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (~50 Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound  6  as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein we demonstrate the application of compound  6  as the first optical probe to visualise real&#8208;time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>GlycoBODIPYs: Sugars Serving as Natural Stock for Water&#8208;soluble Fluorescent Probes of Complex Chiral Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A range of unprocessed, reducing sugar substrates (mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisaccharides) is shown to enter a straightforward 4&#8208;step synthetic route to water&#8208;soluble, uncharged BODIPY derivatives with unimpaired chiral integrity and high fluorescence efficiency. A wide compatibility to several postfunctionalizations is demonstrated suggesting an universal utility of the multifunctional glycoconjugate, which we call GlycoBODIPY. Knoevenagel condensations are able to promote a red&#8208;shift, furnishing strongly fluorescent red and far&#8208;red glycoconjugates of high hydrophilicity. The synthetic outcome was studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by comprehensive photophysical investigations in several solvent systems. Furthermore, cell experiments underline an efficient cell uptake and demonstrate differential cell targeting as a function of the integrated chiral information.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of the two&#8208;dimensional glycan display on glycan&#8208;lectin recognition remains poorly understood despite the importance of these interactions in a plethora of cellular processes, in (patho)physiology, as well as its potential for advanced therapeutics. Faced with this challenge we utilized glycodendrimersomes, a type of synthetic vesicles whose membrane mimics the surface of a cell and offers a means to probe the carbohydrate biological activity. These single&#8208;component vesicles were formed by the self&#8208;assembly of sequence&#8208;defined mannose&#8208;Janus dendrimers, which serve as surrogates for glycolipids. Using atomic force microscopy and molecular modeling we demonstrated that even mannose, a monosaccharide, was capable of organizing the sugar moieties into periodic nanoarrays without the need of the formation of liquid&#8208;ordered phases as assumed necessary for rafts. Kinetics studies of Concanavalin A binding revealed that those nanoarrays resulted in a new effective ligand yielding a ten&#8208;fold increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic constant of association.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Reporter for Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Based on An Aggregation Induced Emission Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs) a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like to a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network are denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. Being able to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, as opposed to vitrify, is a challenge, since both processes lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Here, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method with a high fluorescence contrast to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP&#8208;surfactants (NPSs) at the water/oil interface using aggregation induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. At densities where the AIEgens can move and rotate the AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the intermolecular separation distance is sufficiently small to arrest rotation and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs. This fluorescence behavior provides a unique means to probe jamming behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering electron&#8208;hole migration pathways using oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides to enhance their photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overall water splitting efficiency is mainly restricted by the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Therefore, it is essential to develop active oxygen evolution catalysts. In this regard, we designed and synthesized a tungsten oxide catalyst with oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which exhibited a higher oxygen evolution rate of 683 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;g  &#8208;1  than that of pure WO  3  (159 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;g  &#8208;1  ). Subsequent study through transient absorption spectroscopy found that the oxygen vacancies can produce electron trapping states to inhibit the direct recombination of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a Pt cocatalyst can promote electron trapped states to participate in the reaction to improve the photocatalytic performance further. This work uses femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to explain the photocatalytic oxygen evolution mechanism of inorganic materials and provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;efficiency water&#8208;splitting catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Blatter Radical&#8208;Grafted Mesoporous Silica as Prospective Nanoplatform for Spin Manipulation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum computing and quantum information processing (QC/QIP) crucially depend on the availability of suitable quantum bits (qubits) and methods of their manipulation. Most qubit candidates known to date face obstacles for implementation at ambient conditions. In this work we propose radical&#8208;grafted mesoporous silica as a versatile and prospective nanoplatform for spin&#8208;based QC/QIP. Extremely stable Blatter&#8208;type organic radicals are used, whose electron spin decoherence time is profoundly long even at room temperature (up to  T  m  ~2.3 &#181;s), thus allowing efficient spin manipulation by microwave pulses. Mesoporous structure of such composites is nuclear&#8208;spin free and provides additional opportunities of embedding guest molecules into the structure channels. Robustness and tunability of these materials promotes them as highly promising nanoplatforms for future QC/QIP developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Size Expansion and Turn&#8208;on Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Clusters by Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) clusters remains elusive and their potential applications are still underdeveloped. Herein, we firstly prepared a chain&#8208;like thiolated Ag(I) complex {[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)2(H2O)2]&#183;[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)6]}n  (abbreviated as  Ag18) in which two similar  Ag18  clusters are assembled by NO3&#8208;  anions. The solution containing  Ag18  reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red&#8208;emitting high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag62(S)13(StBu)32(NO3)4  (abbreviated as  Ag62). We tracked the transformation using time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), UV&#8208;Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;on sensor detecting H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30 s) at a low detection limit (0.13 ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>TM LDH Meets Birnessite: A 2D&#8208;2D Hybrid Catalyst with Long&#8208;term Stability for Water Oxidation at Industrial Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient noble&#8208;metal free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water splitting. Inspired by Nature&#8217;s oxygen evolution cluster in photosystem II and the highly efficient artificial OER catalyst of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), we designed an electrostatic 2D&#8208;2D assembly route and successfully synthesized a 2D LDH(+)&#8208;Birnessite(&#8208;) hybrid. The as&#8208;constructed LDH(+)&#8208;Binessite(&#8208;) hybrid catalyst showed advanced catalytic activity and excellent stability towards OER under a close to industrial hydrogen production condition (85 &#186;C and 6 M KOH) for more than 20 h at the current densities larger than 100 mA/cm  2  . Experimentally, we found that besides the enlarged interlayer distance, the flexible interlayer NiFe LDH(+) also modulates the electronic structure of layered MnO  2  , and creates an electric field between NiFe LDH(+) and Birnessite(&#8208;), wherein OER occurs with a greatly decreased overpotential. DFT calculations confirmed the interlayer LDH modulations of the OER process, attributable to the distinct electronic distributions and environments. Upshifting the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in LDH promotes electron transfer from the layered MnO  2  to LDH, significantly boosting up the OER performance. This work opens a new way to fabricating highly efficient OER catalyst for industrial water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site&#8208;Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  ) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron&#8208;transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Molecular Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&gt; 70 mV) anodic shift of the half&#8208;wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O  2  &#160;increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. We demonstrated that H  2  O  2  &#160;generated from O  2  &#160;reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&amp;gt; 70 mV) anodic shift of the half&#8208;wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O  2  &#160;increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. We demonstrated that H  2  O  2  &#160;generated from O  2  &#160;reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of nanoscale [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ from condensation of &#949;&#8208;GeAl128+ Keggin polycations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Keggin&#8208;type polyaluminum cations belong to a unique class of compound with their large positive charge, hydroxo bridges, and divergent isomerization/oligomerization. Previously reports indicate that oligomerization of this species can only occur through one isomer (&#948;), but herein we report the isolation of largest Keggin&#8208;type cluster that occurs through self&#8208;condensation of four &#949;&#8208;isomers &#949;&#8208;GeAl128+ to form [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ cluster (Ge4Al48). The cluster was crystallized and structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and the elemental composition was confirmed by ICP&#8208;MS and SEM&#8208;EDS.&#160; Additional dynamic light scattering experiments confirms the presence of the Ge4Al48 in thermally aged solutions. DFT calculations reveal that a single atom Ge substitution in tetrahedral site of &#949;&#8208;isomer is the key for the formation of Ge4Al48 because it activates deprotonation at key surface sites that control the self&#8208;condensation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Optical Activity in 2D Hybrid Copper Halides: Novel Material for Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have emerged as highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Incorporating chiral organic molecules into metal halides allows for the expansion of their unique optical and electronic properties to chiral optics. Herein, using chiral R&#8208; or S&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA) as the organic component, we present the synthesis of chiral hybrid copper halides, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)  2  CuCl  4  , and investigate their optical activity&#160;for the first time. Thin films of this material show a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor as high as ~0.06. Additionally, we discuss the origin of giant&#160;optical&#160;activity observed in (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)  2  CuCl  4  &#160;through theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and&#160;demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in these samples.&#160;Our work provides insights into the design of chiral materials by structural engineering, building a new platform for chiral&#160;and nonlinear photonic device&#160;applications of the chiral hybrid copper halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Bubble&#8208;propelled Janus Gallium/Zinc Micromotors for Active Treatment of Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a bubble&#8208;propelled Janus gallium/zinc (Ga/Zn) micromotor with good biocompatibility and biodegradability for active target treatment for bacteria, as a robust antibacterial platform. The Janus Ga/Zn micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating liquid metal Ga on Zn microparticles, and display self&#8208;propelling movement in the imitative gastroenteric acid (pH 0.5) at a speed of up to 383 &#956;m s  &#8208;1  under the propulsion of hydrogen bubbles generated by the zinc&#8208;acid reaction. This motion of Ga/Zn micromotors is enhanced by the Ga&#8208;Zn galvanic effect. The produced Ga(III) cations due to the degradation of Ga/Zn micromotors are served as a built&#8208;in antibiotic agent. The movement improves the diffusion of Ga(III) and results in a significant increase of the antibacterial efficiency against  H. pylori  , compared with passive Ga microparticle. Such Ga/Zn micromotors combine the self&#8208;propulsion, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and Ga&#8208;based antibacterial properties, providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the active treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>
