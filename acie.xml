      <title>Deoxygenative Fluorination of Phosphine Oxides: A General Route to Fluorinated Organophosphorus(V) Compounds and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorinated organophosphorus(V) compounds are a very versatile class of compounds, but the synthetic methods available to make them bear the disadvantages of 1) occasional handling of toxic or pyrophoric P(III) starting materials and 2) a dependence on hazardous fluorinating reagents such as XeF  2  . Herein, we present a simple solution and introduce a deoxygenative fluorination (DOF) approach that utilizes easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle phosphine oxides as starting materials and effectively replaces harsh fluorinating reagents by a combination of oxalyl chloride and potassium fluoride. The reaction has proven to be general, as R  3  PF  2  , R  2  PF  3  , and RPF  4  compounds (as well as various cations and anions derived from these) are accessible in good yields and on up to a multi&#8208;gram scale. DFT calculations were used to bolster our observations. Notably, the discovery of this new method led to a convenient synthesis of 1) new difluorophosphonium ions, 2) hexafluorophosphate salts, and 3) fluorinated antimony&#8208; and arsenic&#8208; compounds.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have attracted tremendous attention in the field of photocatalysis, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties for photocatalytic reactions, including high absorption coefficients and long photogenerated carrier lifetimes. Herein, by choosing 2&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxobutanenitrile as a model substrate, we demonstrate that the stereoselective (&gt;99%) C&#8211;C oxidative coupling reaction can be realized with a high product yield (99%) using zwitterionic&#8208;capped CsPbBr3  perovskite QDs under visible light illumination. The reaction can be generalized to different starting materials with various substituents on the phenyl ring and varied functional moieties, producing stereoselective  dl  &#8208;isomers.

      <title>Ambient Temperature Graphitization Based on Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Graphite has become a critical material because of its high supply risk and essential applications in energy industries.

      <title>Reductive Charge Transfer through an RNA Aptamer</title>
      <dc:description>The transfer of charges through double helical DNA is a very well investigated bioelectric phenomenon. RNA, on the contrary, has been less studied in this regard. The few available data report on charge transfer through RNA duplex structures mainly composed of homonucleotide sequences. In the light of RNA world scenarios, it is an interesting question, if charge transfer can be coupled with RNA function. Functional RNAs however, contain versatile structural motifs.

Here, hypoxia&#8208;activated self&#8208;immolative paclitaxel prodrug (PTX  2  &#8208;Azo) was synthesized and combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to prepare light&#8208;boosted PTX nanoparticle (Ce6/PTX  2  &#8208;Azo NP) by encapsulation PTX  2  &#8208;Azo into photosensitizer chlorine (Ce6) decorated peptide copolymer. In this nanoparticle, PTX  2  &#8208;Azo prevents unexpected premature drug leakage and realizes specific release in hypoxic tumor microenvironment and photosensitizer Ce6 not only efficiently generates singlet oxygen under light irradiation but also acts as a positive amplifier to promote the release of PTX. Moreover, chemotherapy compensates the deficiency of PDT as well. Such combination of PDT and chemotherapy displays excellent antitumor efficacy.

This study represents hypoxia&#8208;activatable chemotherapeutic prodrug system and its great potential for synergistic cancer therapy  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Molecular imprinting technique and dynamic covalent chemistry were implemented to achieve quantitative one&#8208;pot syntheses of homochiral helical cages inside aromatic foldamers. One&#8208;handed helical cages P&#8208;1, M&#8208;1, P&#8208;2 and M&#8208;2 were assembled from their precursors in the presence of appropriate templates (d&#8208;, l&#8208;tartaric acid, d&#8208; and l&#8208;sorbitol, respectively) via three sequential steps in one pot: imine&#8208;linked chain elongation, template&#8208;induced folding and [4+2] cycloaddition between helical turns. These helical cages were proven to enantioselectively bind chiral guests used as the templates, and the differences between the association constants of enantiomeric guests were up to more than two orders of magnitude. The structures and binding modes of the cages were fully characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and 1H NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>A Strategy for Constructing Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned MOFs with High Uptake Capacity for C2 Hydrocarbons and CO2</title>
      <dc:description>
Record&#8208;setting amounts of small hydrocarbon gas molecules such as acetylene and ethylene can be captured in a bimetallic cobalt&#8211;vanadium material synthesized by an unusual form of pore&#8208;space partition.







Abstract
Introduction of pore partition agents into hexagonal channels of MIL&#8208;88 type (acs topology) endows materials with high tunability in gas sorption. Here, we report a strategy to partition acs framework into pacs (partitioned acs) crystalline porous materials (CPM). This strategy is based on insertion of in&#8197;situ synthesized 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylsulfide (dps) ligands. One third of open metal sites in the acs net are retained in pacs MOFs; two thirds are used for pore&#8208;space partition. The Co2V&#8208;pacs MOFs exhibit near or at record high uptake capacities for C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and CO2 among MOFs. The storage capacity of C2H2 is 234&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (298&#8197;K) and 330&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (273&#8197;K) at 1&#8197;atm for CPM&#8208;733&#8208;dps (the Co2V&#8208;BDC form, BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate). These high uptake capacities are accomplished with low heat of adsorption, a feature desirable for low&#8208;energy&#8208;cost adsorbent regeneration. CPM&#8208;733&#8208;dps is stable and shows no loss of C2H2 adsorption capacity following multiple adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles.

      <title>Colyliform Crystalline 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Quasi&#8208;3D Topologies for Rapid I2 Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural characteristics on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a smart approach to effectively improve the pore permeability and mass transfer rate of the materials and realize the rapid adsorption for guest molecules, while avoiding the high cost and monomer scarcity in preparing 3D COFs. Herein, we report for the first time a series of colyliform crystalline 2D COFs with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;3D) topologies, consisting of unique &#8220;stereoscopic&#8221; triangular pores, large interlayer spacings and flexible constitutional units which makes the pores elastic and self&#8208;adaptable for the object transmission. The as&#8208;prepared QTD&#8208;COFs have fairly faster adsorption rate (2.51 g/h) for iodine than traditional 2D COFs, with an unprecedented maximum adsorption capacity of 6.29 g/g. The excellent adsorption performance, as well as the prominent irradiation stability enable the QTD&#8208;COFs to be reliably applied to the rapid removal of radioactive iodine under special circumstances of emergency response to nuclear accidents.</dc:description>

      <title>Pb18O8Cl15I5: A Polar Lead Mixed Oxyhalide with Unprecedented Architecture and Excellent Infrared Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>To develop high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for infrared (IR) applications, we have applied a rational element&#8208;composition design strategy and investigated the unexplored PbO&#8211;PbCl 2  &#8211;PbI 2  system. By doing so, a new polar lead mixed oxyhalide, Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  , representing the first synthetic metal oxyhalide combining both Cl &#8211;  and I &#8211;  was discovered. Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  reveals an unprecedented structural feature with two different dimensional types of oxocentered Pb&#8211;O units, namely, [O 4  Pb 8  ] 8+  clusters and [OPb 2  ] 2+  chains. Centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals of Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  have been successfully grown in ambient condition. Remarkably, Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  satisfies all fundermental yet rigorous cretiria for high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials, exhibiting the widest IR transparency (up to 16.0 &#956;m) among oxide&#8208;based crystals, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.05 &#215; AgGaS 2  ), superior birefringence (0.086 at 636 nm), and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (8.5 &#215; AgGaS 2  ).</dc:description>

By doing so, a new polar lead mixed oxyhalide, Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  , representing the first synthetic metal oxyhalide combining both Cl &#8211;  and I &#8211;  was discovered. Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  reveals an unprecedented structural feature with two different dimensional types of oxocentered Pb&#8211;O units, namely, [O 4  Pb 8  ] 8+  clusters and [OPb 2  ] 2+  chains. Centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals of Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  have been successfully grown in ambient condition. Remarkably, Pb 18  O 8  Cl 15  I 5  satisfies all fundermental yet rigorous cretiria for high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials, exhibiting the widest IR transparency (up to 16.0 &#956;m) among oxide&#8208;based crystals, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.05 &#215; AgGaS 2  ), superior birefringence (0.086 at 636 nm), and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (8.5 &#215; AgGaS 2  ).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis Unlocks the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanation of Aryl Halides under Benign Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are among the most used methods for synthesizing aryl nitriles. Despite tremendous advances, cyanating an aryl halide in a facile and benign fashion has generally been unsuccessful. The challenge for this significant transformation is the strong affinity of cyanide for metal centers, which makes organometallic catalysis elusive by hampering oxidative addition and reductive elimination. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are readily enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, in which Ni(II) species are transiently oxidized to Ni(III) species, thereby facilitating the subsequent cyanide transfer and reductive elimination. Using this dual catalysis strategy, we cyanated aryl and alkenyl halides at room temperature in a highly benign manner (30 examples, 53&#8208;93% yields) by avoiding the use of air&#8208;sensitive ligands, Ni(0) processors, and hypertoxic cyanation reagents, while also not generating excess metal waste. Computational studies were also used to help understand the present transformation.</dc:description>

      <title>Alternative Oxidants for the Catalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O  2  &#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to CO  x  products. Other gaseous reagents such as N  2  O, CO  2  , and S  2  have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O  2  . Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X&#8208;OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N  2  O, CO  2  , S  2  , and other non&#8208;O  2  oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O  2  &#8208;OCM.

      <title>Trapping Transient RNA Complexes by Chemically Reversible Acylation</title>
      <dc:description>RNA&#8208;RNA interactions are essential for biology, yet they can be difficult to study due to their transient nature. While crosslinking strategies can in principle be used to trap such interactions, virtually all existing strategies for crosslinking are poorly reversible, chemically modifying the RNA and hindering molecular analysis. Here, we describe a soluble crosslinker design (BINARI) that reacts with RNA via acylation. We find that it efficiently crosslinks noncovalent RNA complexes with miminal sequence bias and establish that the crosslink can be reversed by phosphine reduction of azide trigger groups, liberating the individual RNA components for further analysis. Use of the new approach is demonstrated by reversible protection against nuclease degradation and by trapping transient RNA complexes of E. coli DsrA&#8208;rpoS derived bulge&#8208;loop interactions, which underlines the potential of BINARI crosslinkers to probe RNA regulatory networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Achieving Ultrahigh Molecular Weights with Diverse Architectures for Unconjugated Monomers through Oxygen&#8208;tolerant Photoenzymatic RAFT Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Achieving well&#8208;defined polymers with ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) is an enduring pursuit in the field of reversible deactivation radical polymerization. Synthetic protocols have been successfully developed to achieve UHMWs with low dispersities exclusively from conjugated monomers while no polymerization of unconjugated monomers has provided the same level of control. Herein, an oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzymatic RAFT polymerization is exploited to tackle this challenge for unconjugated monomers at 10  o  C , enabling facile synthesis of well&#8208;defined, linear and star polymers with near&#8208;quantitative conversions, unprecedented UHMWs and low dispersities. The exquisite level of control over composition, MW and architecture, coupled with the operational ease, mild conditions and environmental friendliness, broadens the monomer scope to include unconjugated monomers to achieve previously inaccessible low&#8208;dispersity UHMWs.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Hydroperoxygenation of Olefin Realized by Coinage Multimetallic 1&#8208;nanometer Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The science of particles on a sub&#8208;nanometer (~ 1 nm) scale has attracted worldwide attention. However, this field of science has remained unexplored because of the technical difficulty in the precise synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoparticles (SNPs). Thus, we recently developed the &#8216;atom&#8208;hybridization method (AHM)&#8217; that precisely synthesizes the SNPs by using a suitably&#8208;designed macromolecule as a template. In this study, toward revealing this unexplored field, we newly investigated the chemical reactivity of alloy SNPs obtained by the AHM. Focusing on the coinage metal elements, the oxidation reaction of an olefin catalyzed by these SNPs was systematically evaluated. The SNPs showed a high catalytic performance even under the milder condition in contrast to conventional catalysts. Additionally, the hybridization of multiple elements enhanced the turnover frequency and the selectivity of the hydroperoxide derivative. We discuss the unique quantum&#8208;sized catalysts providing generally unstable hydroperoxides from the viewpoint of miniaturization and hybridization of the materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhizolutin, a novel 7/10/6&#8208;tricyclic dilactone, dissociates misfolded protein aggregates and reduces apoptosis/inflammation associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
      <dc:description>Rhizolutin (  1  ) was discovered as a natural product of ginseng&#8208;rhizospheric  Streptomyces  sp. WON17. Its structure featured an unprecedented 7/10/6&#8208;tricyclic dilactone carbon skeleton composed of dimethylcyclodecatriene flanked by a 7&#8208;membered and a 6&#8208;membered lactone ring based on spectroscopic analysis. During an unbiased screening of natural product libraries, this novel compound was found to dissociate amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques and tau tangles, which are key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Rhizolutin treatment of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice with AD significantly dissociated hippocampal plaques.  In vitro  , rhizolutin substantially decreased A&#946;&#8208;induced apoptosis and inflammation in neuronal and glial cells. Our findings introduce a unique chemical entity that targets A&#946; and tau concurrently by mimicking misfolded protein clearance mechanisms of immunotherapy, which is prominently investigated in clinical trials.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrafast Semi&#8208;Solid Processing of Highly Durable ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
      <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membrane has emerged as the most promising candidate for propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) separation due to its precise molecular sieving characteristics. The poor reproducibility and durability, high cost, thus far pose challenges on the scalable synthesis and industrial application of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Herein, we report a semi&#8208;solid process featured with ultrafast and high&#8208;yield synthesis, and outstanding scalability for reproducible fabrication of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. The resultant membranes exhibit excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance in a wide range of temperature and pressure, and remarkable stability over a span of 6 months. The new ZIF&#8208;8 membrane features dimethylacetamide entrapped ZIF&#8208;8 crystals retainning same diffusion charactristics but offering enhanced adsorptive selectivity for C3H6/C3H8. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane was successfully fabricated on commercial flat&#8208;sheet ceramic substrate. A prototypical plate&#8208;and&#8208;frame membrane module with effective membrane area of about 300 cm2  was implemented for efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Overall, the reliable reproducibility and durability as well as scalability of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have greatly unlocked its commercialization potential.</dc:description>

Furthermore, a stable performance of oligomers as a cathode material in a Li&#8208;ion battery proved that the one&#8208;dimensionally stacked, rotatable structure of SiPc oligomers is useful to control the orientation of functional molecules toward molecular electronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Overcoming Fundamental Limitations in Adsorbent Design: Alkene Adsorption by Non&#8208;porous Copper(I) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Purifying alkenes from alkanes requires cryogenic distillation. At global scale, this consumes energy equivalent to countries of ca. 5 million people. Replacing distillation with adsorption processes would significantly increase energy efficiency. Trade&#8208;offs between kinetics, selectivity, capacity, and heat of adsorption have prevented production of an optimal adsorbent. We report adsorbents that overcome these trade&#8208;offs.  [Cu&#8208;Br]  3  and  [Cu&#8208;H]  3  are air&#8208;stable trinuclear complexes that undergo reversible solid&#8208;state inter&#8208;molecular rearrangements to produce dinuclear  [Cu&#8208;Br&#8226;(alkene)]  2  and  [Cu&#8208;H&#8226;(alkene)]  2  . The reversible solid&#8208;state rearrangement, confirmed  in&#8208;situ  using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, allows adsorbent design trade&#8208;offs to be overcome, coupling low heat of adsorption (&#8208;10 to &#8208;17 kJ&#183;mol  &#8208;1  alkene  ), high alkene:alkane selectivity (47; 29), and uptake capacity (&gt;2.5 mol  alkene  &#183;mol  &#8208;1  Cu3  ).

      <title>Sub&#8208;10 nm Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Quantum Dots Assembled by Microfluidics for Enhanced Tumor&#8208;Targeting and Reduced Retention in the Liver</title>
      <dc:description>A robust platform is developed to assemble sub&#8208;10 nm organic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) particles using four different AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with emissions from green to the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II).

Compared with AIE dots that are larger than 25 nm, AIE QDs allow more efficient cellular uptake and imaging without surface modification of any membrane&#8208;penetrating peptides or other targeting molecules. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, which have nearly no background fluorescence from organisms, are used to demonstrate that AIE QDs can achieve high contrast at the tumor as small as 80 mm  3  , and evade the liver more efficiently than AIE dots. AIE QDs hold a good promise for sensitive and precise diagnosis of the latent solid tumor in clinical medicine with much lower off&#8208;targeting to the liver than AIE dots.</dc:description>

      <title>Bright infrared to ultraviolet and visible upconversion in small alkaline earth&#8208;based nanoparticles with biocompatible CaF2 shells</title>
      <dc:description>Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising candidates for photon&#8208;driven reactions, including light&#8208;triggered drug delivery, photodynamic therapy, and photocatalysis. Here, we investigate the NIR to UV and visible emission of sub&#8208;15 nm alkaline&#8208;earth rare&#8208;earth fluoride UCNPs (M  1&#8208;x  Ln  x  F  2+x,  MLnF) with a CaF  2  shell. We synthesize 8 alkaline&#8208;earth host materials doped with Yb  3+  and Tm  3+  , with alkaline&#8208;earth (M) spanning Ca, Sr, and Ba, MgSr, CaSr, CaBa, SrBa, and CaSrBa. We explore UCNP composition, size, and lanthanide doping dependent emission, focusing on upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) and UV emission. UCQY values of 2.46% at 250 W/cm  2  are achieved with 14.5 nm SrLuF@CaF  2  particles, with 7.3% of total emission in the UV. In 10.9 nm SrYbF:1%Tm  3+  @CaF  2  particles, UV emission increased to 9.9% with UCQY at 1.14%. We demonstrate dye degradation under NIR illumination using SrYbF:1%Tm  3+  @CaF  2  , highlighting the efficiency of these UCNPs and their ability to trigger photoprocesses.</dc:description>

      <title>Lithium Nitrate Regulated Sulfone Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The electrolytes in lithium metal batteries have to be compatible with both lithium metal anodes and high voltage cathodes, which can be regulated by manipulating the solvation structure.

      <title>Emergent Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Candidates</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the search for practical next&#8208;generation deep&#8208;UV NLO crystals are reviewed. The aim is to provide a clear perspective on the development of current deep&#8208;UV NLO candidates, and to accelerate the discovery of future candidates with high performance to meet the urgent demand.

Abstract
Advances in the generation of coherent lasers at wavelengths below 200&#8197;nm as well as the associated equipment and technologies have greatly spurred the development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that are capable of phase&#8208;matching in the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) spectral regions. However, few crystals can meet the technical demands, and studies to date have focused mainly on finding the next competitive candidates. Consequently, several crystals have emerged that hold great potential for the production of deep&#8208;UV harmonic coherent light, which benefit from newly developed systems with novel NLO&#8208;active units and chromophores. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the developments of emergent candidates in the field of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials, discussing the recent efforts and active advances in the search for superior systems and in understanding their structure&#8211;property relationships. The intention is to provide a clear perspective on the current emergent deep&#8208;UV NLO candidates, and to accelerate the discovery of next candidates with high performances to meet the urgent demands.

Notably, based on theoretical simulation analysis results, we convinced that the embedded Ag  +  could improve the relatively large bandgap of BP QD  via  intense charge coupling, subsequently leading to the enhanced optical absorption capability, accompanied with the occurrence of the strong NIR&#8208;II PA signal. Guiding with the NIR&#8208;II PA bioimaging, the hidden Ag+ can be precisely released with the disassembly of Ve during photodynamic therapy (PDT) process and captured by macrophages located in lesion region for arousing synergistic cancer photodynamic/Ag  +  immunotherapy benefited from the integration of immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect and macrophages activation. Furthermore, BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  can contrapuntally kill pathogenic bacteria and accelerate wound healing with the assist of NIR&#8208;II PA imaging.

Nanotechnology based on functional nucleic acids (FNAs) is an interdisciplinary field that builds on the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials. In this Review, a number of common FNA nanomaterials are described along with their structures and applications.

Abstract
Functional nucleic acid (FNA) nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field between nucleic acid biochemistry and nanotechnology that focuses on the study of interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials and explores the particular advantages and applications of FNA nanomaterials. With the goal of building the next&#8208;generation biomaterials that combine the advantages of FNAs and nanomaterials, the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials as well as FNA self&#8208;assembly technologies have established themselves as hot research areas, where the target recognition, response, and self&#8208;assembly ability, combined with the plasmon properties, stability, stimuli&#8208;response, and delivery potential of various nanomaterials can give rise to a variety of novel fascinating applications. As research on the structural and functional group features of FNAs and nanomaterials rapidly develops, many laboratories have reported numerous methods to construct FNA nanomaterials. In this Review, we first introduce some widely used FNAs and nanomaterials along with their classification, structure, and application features. Then we discuss the most successful methods employing FNAs and nanomaterials as elements for creating advanced FNA nanomaterials. Finally, we review the extensive applications of FNA nanomaterials in bioimaging, biosensing, biomedicine, and other important fields, with their own advantages and drawbacks, and provide our perspective about the issues and developing trends in FNA nanotechnology.

However, new organic redox&#8208;active molecules with good chemical stability and high solubility are still desired for high&#8208;performance aqueous RFBs due to their low crossover capability and high abundance.

By rationally tailoring the molecular structure of azobenzene, the solubility is favorably improved from near&#8208;zero to 2 M due to the highly charged asymmetric structure formed in alkaline environment. DFT simulations suggest that the concentrated solution stability can be enhanced by adding hydrotropic agent to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

      <title>Electrochemically Induced MOF&#8208;Derived Amorphous V2O5 for Superior Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical performance of vanadium oxide&#8208;based cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) depends on their crystal degree and composite state with carbon materials. Herein, an  in&#8208;situ  electrochemical induction strategy was developed to fabricate MOF&#8208;derived composite of amorphous V  2  O  5  and carbon materials (a&#8208;V  2  O  5  @C) for the first time, where the V  2  O  5  is amorphous state and uniformly distributed in carbon framework. The amorphous structure endows V  2  O  5  with more isotropic Zn  2+  diffusion routes and active sites, resulting in fast Zn  2+  transport and high specific capacity. The porous carbon framework provides continuous electron transport pathway and ion diffusion channels. As a result, the a&#8208;V  2  O  5  @C composites display extraordinary electrochemical performance. This work will pave the way for designing the cathodes of ZIBs with superior rate performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Jahn&#8208;Teller Disproportionation Induced Exfoliation of Unit&#8208;Cell Scale &#949;&#8208;MnO2</title>
      <dc:description>Exfoliation of nanosheet from non&#8208;layered bulk material is challenging because of the strong chemical bonds in lattice, rather than the weak van de Waals (vdW) interaction in the layered bulk counterparts. In this paper, we propose a top&#8208;down method to exfoliate &#949;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets from a family of charge&#8208;ordered La1&#8208;xAExMnO3 (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) perovskites, taking advantage of Jahn&#8208;Teller disproportion effect of Mn3+ and bond strength difference. The &#949;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheet (a thickness of 0.91 nm, two&#8208;fold of the unit cell along c&#8208;axis) crystalized into a nickel arsenide (NiAs) structure with ordered arrangement of 50% cation vacancy in reference to NiAs, which shows thermal metastability and the best water oxidation activity compared with other types of manganese oxide. The exfoliation mechanism has been reasoned as a synergistic proton&#8208;induced Mn3+ disproportionation and structural reconstruction. The stochastic surface walking (SSW) pathway calculation of energy and phase transformation suggested a proton&#8208;exchanged perovskite to birnessite route followed by the local reconstruction of MnO6 from perovskite skeleton. The synthetic method could also be potentially extended to the exfoliation of other two&#8208;dimensional nanosheet materials with non&#8208;layered crystal structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Suppression of formylation provides an alternative approach to vacant codon creation in bacterial in vitro translation</title>
      <dc:description>A particularly powerful approach to controlled protein modification is through the use genetic code reprogramming. One remaining challenge, however, is the convenient generation of vacant codons.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A particularly powerful approach to controlled protein modification is through the use genetic code reprogramming. One remaining challenge, however, is the convenient generation of vacant codons. In this work we target the initiation machinery of  Escherichia coli  , showing that simple restriction of formyl donor or inhibition of the formyl transferase during  in vitro  translation is sufficient to prevent formylation of the acylated initiating tRNA and thereby create a vacant initiation codon that can be reprogrammed by exogenously charged tRNA.

      <title>Single&#8208;electron Transfer in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) are well known for their ability to activate small molecules. Recent reports of radical formation within such systems indicate single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) could play an important role in their chemistry. Herein, we investigate radical formation upon reacting FLP systems with dihydrogen, triphenyltin hydride or tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCQ) both experimentally and computationally to determine the nature of the single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) events; i.e. being direct SET to B(C  6  F  5  )  3  or not. We show that the reactions of H  2  and Ph  3  SnH with archetypal P/B FLP systems do not proceed via a radical mechanism. In contrast, reaction with TCQ proceeds via SET, which is only feasible by Lewis acid coordination to the substrate. Furthermore, we highlight that SET from the Lewis base to the Lewis acid&#8211;substrate adduct may be prevalent in other literature examples of radical FLP chemistry, which provides important design principles for radical main&#8208;group chemistry.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Following translation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA genome into two viral polypeptides, the main protease M  pro  cleaves at eleven sites to release non&#8208;structural proteins required for viral replication.

Analysis of the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of  K  d  = 0.14 &#177; 0.03 &#181;M, revealing M  Pro  has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. Developing an MS&#8208;based kinetic assay we then characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes, which are effectively &#8220;flash&#8208;frozen&#8221; as they transition from solution to the gas phase. We screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the catalytically active dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by ~35%. This information was readily obtained and, together with analysis of the x&#8208;ray crystal structures of these enzyme&#8208;small molecule complexes, provides a starting point for the development of more potent molecules that allosterically regulate M  Pro  activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Charge Transfer State to Facilitate Spin&#8208;orbit Charge Transfer Intersystem Crossing in Spirobis[anthracene]diones Solution</title>
      <dc:description>The potency of spiro&#8208;conjugation has been proposed to dictate the efficiency of charge transfer, which could directly affect spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, as predicted by the El&#8208;Sayed rule. However, this process has yet to be exemplified. Herein, we judiciously prepared three novel spirobis[anthracene]diones, in which two benzophenone moieties are locked in close proximity and differentially functionalized to fine&#8208;tune the charge transfer state. Its feasibility for SOCT&#8208;ISC was theoretically predicted, then experimentally evaluated. Through fine&#8208;tuning the spiro&#8208;conjugation coupling and varying the solvent dielectric constants, ISC rate constants were engineered to vary in a dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude, from 7.8&#215;108  s&#8208;1  to 1.0&#215;1011  s&#8208;1  , which is the highest ISC rate reported for SOCT&#8208;ISC system to our knowledge. Our findings substantiate the key factors for effective SOCT&#8208;ISC and offer a new avenue for the rational design of heavy atom free triplet sensitizers.</dc:description>

      <title>Coverage&#8208;dependent Behaviors of Vanadium Oxides for Chemical Looping Oxidative Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical looping provides an energy and cost effective route for alkane utilization. However, there is considerable CO  2  co&#8208;production caused by kinetically mismatched O  2&#8208;  bulk diffusion in current chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation systems, rendering a decreased olefin productivity. This paper describes the successful construction of sub&#8208;monolayer or monolayer vanadia nanostructures to suppress CO  2  production in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by evading the interference of O  2&#8208;  bulk diffusion (monolayer versus multi&#8208;layer). The highly dispersed vanadia nanostructures on titanium dioxide support showed over 90% propylene selectivity at 500 &#176;C, exhibiting highest turnover frequency of 1.9&#215;10  &#8208;2  s  &#8208;1  , which is over 20 times greater than that of conventional crystalline V  2  O  5  oxygen carriers. Combining in situ spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory calculation, we revealed the loading&#8211;reaction barrier relationship through the vanadia/titanium interfacial interaction. This work demonstrates that sub&#8208;monolayer or monolayer nanostructures have the potential to serve as a general oxygen carrier materials platform for redox reactions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Operando  nuclear resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (NRIXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopy (XAFS) measurements have been used to gain insight into the structure and surface composition of FeCu and FeAg nanoparticles (NPs) during the CO  2  electrochemical reduction (CO  2  RR) and to extract correlations with their catalytic activity and selectivity. The formation of a core&#8208;shell structure during CO  2  RR for FeAg NPs was inferred from the analysis of the  operando  NRIXS data (phonon density of states, PDOS) and XAFS measurements. Electrochemical analysis of the FeAg NPs revealed a faradaic selectivity of ~&#160;36 % for CO in 0.1&#160;M KHCO  3  at &#8208;1.1 V vs RHE, similar to that of pure Ag NPs. In contrast, a predominant selectivity towards H  2  evolution is obtained in the case of the FeCu NPs, analogous to the results obtained for pure Fe NPs, although small Cu NPs have also been shown to favor H  2  production. These results, together with the findings from NRIXS and XAFS, revealed that Ag is preferentially present on the surface of the FeAg NPs during CO  2  RR, while Cu is also likely to be mainly distributed on the surface of the FeCu NPs but with a larger degree of intermixing with Fe.</dc:description>

      <title>Toward replacing ethylene oxide in a sustainable world: Glycolaldehyde as bio&#8208;based C2 platform molecule</title>
      <dc:description>Nowadays, fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide serve as primary feedstock for the C  2  &#8208;based chemical industry.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide serve as primary feedstock for the C  2  &#8208;based chemical industry. However, in search for a more sustainable chemical industry, fossil&#8208;based resources may preferentially be replaced by renewable alternatives, provided realistic economic feasibility. This review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward&#160;bio&#8208;based structural analogs of ethylene oxide and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C  2  &#8208;based chemical processes.

      <title>Flexible C&#8211;C Bond: Reversible Expansion, Contraction, Formation, and Scission of Extremely Elongated Single Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Since carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) covalent bonds are rigid and robust, the bond length is, in general, nearly constant and depends only on the bond order and hybrid orbitals. We report here direct visualization of the reversible expansion and contraction of a Csp3&#8211;Csp3 single bond by light and heat. This flexibility of a C&#8211;C bond was demonstrated by X&#8208;ray analyses and Raman spectroscopy of hexaphenylethane (HPE)&#8208;type hydrocarbons with two spiro&#8208;dibenzocycloheptatriene units, where intramolecular [2+2] photocyclization and thermal cleavage of the resulting cyclobutane ring both occur in a single&#8208;crystalline phase. The force constant of the contracted C&#8211;C bond is 1.6 times greater than that of the expanded bond. Since formation of the cyclobutane ring and contraction of the C&#8211;C bond lower the HOMO level by ca. 1 eV, the oxidative properties of these HPEs having a flexible C&#8211;C bond can be deactivated/activated by light/heat.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Cleavage of C&#8722;C Single Bonds: Making the Cut in Total Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Rapid remodeling of skeletal frameworks can be achieved by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds and enable new retrosynthetic disconnections. In this Review, ten total syntheses from 2014&#8211;2019 are highlighted that illustrate how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds can streamline synthetic efforts.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds can enable entirely new retrosynthetic disconnections in the total synthesis of natural products. Given that C&#8722;C bond cleavage inherently alters the carbon framework of a compound, and that, under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, the generated organometallic or radical intermediate is primed for further complexity&#8208;building reactivity, C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage events have the potential to drastically and rapidly remodel skeletal frameworks. The recent acceleration of the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds in total synthesis can be ascribed to a communal recognition of this fact. In this Review, we highlight ten selected total syntheses from 2014 to 2019 that illustrate how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds at either the core or the periphery of synthetic intermediates can streamline synthetic efforts.

      <title>Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Battery with Improved Electrochemical Performance by Cobalt&#8208;Containing Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The rechargeable aluminum sulfur (Al&#8208;S) battery is regarded as a potential alternative beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery system owing to its safety, promising energy density, and the high earth abundance of the constituent electrode materials, however, sluggish kinetic response and short life&#8208;span are the major issues that limit the battery&#8217;s development towards applications. In this article, we report Co(II, III) as an electrochemical catalyst in the sulfur cathode that renders a reduced discharge&#8208;charge voltage hysteresis and improved capacity retention and rate capability for Al&#8208;S batteries. The structural and electrochemical analysis suggest that the catalytic effect of Co(II, III) is closely associated with the formation of cobalt sulfides and the changes in the valence states of the Co(II,III) during the electrochemical reactions of the sulfur species, which lead to improved reaction kinetics and sulfur utilization in the cathode. The Al&#8208;S battery, assembled with the cathode consisting of Co(II,III) decorated carbon matrix, demonstrates a considerably reduced voltage hysteresis of 0.8 V, a reversible specific capacity of &#8764;500 mAh/g  &#160;  at 1 A/g  &#160;  after 200 discharge&#8208;charge cycles and of &#8764;300 mAh/g  &#160;  at 3 A/g  &#160;  .</dc:description>
