      <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclic &#960;&#8208;Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis and properties of anthracene&#8208;based cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters  1  and  2  , which possess two and four anthracene units, respectively, are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)&#8208;mediated reaction that afforded  1  as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face manner resulted in red&#8208;shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Cyclic &#960;&#8208;cluster  1  exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on  1  affords its photoisomer  1  &#8217; having C&#8211;C bonds that are longer than 1.65 &#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion to  1  under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of photoisomer  1  &#8217; (colorless) to  1  (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A vinylogous aldol&#8208;type reaction of allylazaarenes and aldehydes is disclosed, which affords a series of chiral &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated azaarenes in moderate to excellent yields with high to excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. With (  R  ,  R  P  )&#8208;TANIAPHOS and (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;QUINOXP* as the ligand, the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in the products is generated in (  E  )&#8208;form. With (  R  )&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS as the ligand, (  Z  )&#8208;form carbon&#8208;carbon double bond is formed in the major product. In this vinylogous reaction, aromatic, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated, and aliphatic aldehydes are competent substrates. Moreover, a variety of azaarenes, such as pyrimidine, pyridine, pyrazine, quinoline, quinoxaline, quinazoline, and benzo[  d  ]imidazole are well tolerated.

      <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the magnitude of charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density&#8208;functional calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the boron formazanate ring.

      <title>4D&#8208;Printing of Photoswitchable Actuators</title>
      <dc:description>Shape&#8208;switching behavior, where a transient stimulus induces an indefinitely stable deformation that can be recovered on exposure to another transient stimulus, is critical to building smart structures from responsive polymers as continue power is not needed to maintain deformations. Here, we 4D&#8208;print shape&#8208;switching liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) functionalized with supramolecular crosslinks, dynamic covalent crosslinks and azobenzene. The salient property of shape&#8208;switching LCEs is that light induces long&#8208;lived, deformation that can be recovered on&#8208;demand by heating. UV&#8208;light isomerizes azobenzene from  trans  to  cis  , and temporarily breaks the supramolecular crosslinks, resulting in a programmed deformation. After UV, the shape&#8208;switching LCEs fix more than 90% of the deformation over 3 days by the reformed supramolecular crosslinks. Using the shape&#8208;switching properties, we print Braille&#8208;like actuators that can be photoswitched to display different letters. This new class of photoswitchable actuators may impact applications such as deployable devices where continuous application of power is impractical.</dc:description>

      <title>Kinetic Limitations in Single&#8208;Crystal High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;nickel cathodes attract immense interest for use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, to boost Li&#8208;storage capacity while reducing cost. For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the electrochemical kinetics of electrodes. We report here a quantitative assessment of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.8O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC) &#8208; being sluggish at low SOC while increasing rapidly as SOC increases both in the bulk electrode and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode. With the elucidated mechanistic origin and alleviation solution of kinetic limitations in single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;Ni cathodes, this work constitutes a step forward in enabling their practical deployment.</dc:description>

      <title>Prevent or Cure &#8211; The Unprecedented Need for Self&#8208;Reporting Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, e.g. prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self&#8208;healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self&#8208;reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self&#8208;reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self&#8208;reporting systems, the recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self&#8208;reporting fashion.</dc:description>

      <title>Glucose Binding Drives Reconfiguration of a Dynamic Library of Urea&#8208;Containing Metal&#8208;Organic Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>A bis&#8208;urea&#8208;functionalized ditopic subcomponent assembled with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and FeII  , resulting in a dynamic library of metal&#8208;organic assemblies: an irregular FeII4L6  structure, and three FeII2L3  stereoisomers: left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helicates and a  meso  &#8208;structure.

      <title>An ER&#8208;Targeting Iridium(III) Complex which Induces Immunogenic Cell Death in Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a vital component of therapeutically induced anti&#8208;tumor immunity. An iridium(III) complex (  Ir1  ), containing an  N  ,  N  &#8208;bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)&#8208;azane derivate, as an endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;localized ICD inducer for non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is herein reported. The characteristic discharge of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), i.e. cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT), extracellular exclusion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and ATP, were generated by  Ir1  in A549 lung cancer cells, accompanied by an increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The vaccination of immunocompetent mice with  Ir1  &#8208;treated dying cells elicited an antitumor CD8  +  T cell response and Foxp3  +  T cell depletion, which eventually resulted in long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;tumor immunity by the activation of ICD in lung cancer cells. With the dual actions of ICD and chemotherapy against NSCLC,  Ir1  has great potential as an antitumor agent. To the best of our knowledge,  Ir1  is the first iridium&#8208;based complex that is capable of developing an immunomodulatory response by immunogenic cell death.</dc:description>

      <title>Opening magnetic hysteresis by axial ferromagnetic coupling: from mono&#8208;decker to double&#8208;decker metallacrown</title>
      <dc:description>Combining Ising&#8208;type magnetic anisotropy with collinear magnetic interactions in single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is a significant synthetic challenge. Herein we report a Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] (1&#8208;Dy) SMM, where a DyIII ion is held in a central pseudo&#8208;D5h pocket of a rigid and planar Cu5 metallacrown (MC). Linking two Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] units with a single hydroxide bridge yields the double&#8208;decker {Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5]}2 (2&#8208;Dy) SMM where the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are collinear, resulting in magnetic relaxation times for 2&#8208;Dy that are ca. 200,000 times slower at 2 K than for 1&#8208;Dy in zero external field. Whereas 1&#8208;Dy and the YIII&#8208;diluted Dy@2&#8208;Y analogue do not show remanence in magnetic hysteresis experiments, the hysteresis data for 2&#8208;Dy remain open up to 6 K without a sudden drop at zero field. In conjunction with theoretical calculations, these results demonstrate that the axial ferromagnetic Dy&#8208;Dy coupling suppresses fast quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM). The relaxation profiles of both complexes curiously exhibit three distinct exponential regimes, and hold the largest effective energy barriers for any reported d&#8208;f SMMs up to 625 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

The high stability of Nisin along with the high towing force of the micromotors allow for efficient micromotor operation in untreated raw media (tap water, juice and serum) and even in blood and in flowing blood in magnetic mode. The high selectivity of the approach is illustrated by the dramatically lower interaction with gram&#8208;negative bacteria (Escherichia Coli). The double&#8208;propulsion (catalytic or fuel&#8208;free magnetic) mode of the micromotors and the high biocompatibility holds considerable promise to design micromotors with tailored lanbiotics that can response to the changes that make the bacteria resistant in a myriad of clinical, environmental remediation or food safety applications.</dc:description>

      <title>The pH&#8208;Induced Selectivity Between Cysteine or Histidine Coordinated Heme in an Artificial &#945;&#8208;Helical Metalloprotein</title>
      <dc:description>De Novo  metalloprotein design assesses the relationship between metal active site architecture and catalytic reactivity. Herein, we use an &#945;&#8208;helical scaffold to control the iron coordination geometry when a heme cofactor is allowed to bind to either histidine or cysteine ligands, within a single artificial protein. Consequently, we uncovered a reversible pH&#8208;induced switch of the heme axial ligation within this simplified scaffold. Characterization of the specific heme coordination modes was done by using UV&#8208;Vis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopies. The penta&#8208; or hexa&#8208;coordinate thiolate heme (9 &#8804; pH &#8804; 11) and the penta&#8208;coordinate imidazole heme (6 &#8804; pH &#8804; 8.5) reproduces well the heme ligation in chloroperoxidases or cyt P450 monooxygenases and peroxidases, respectively. The stability of heme coordination upon ferric/ferrous redox cycling is a crucial property of the construct. At basic pHs, the thiolate mini&#8208;heme protein can catalyze O  2  reduction when adsorbed onto a pyrolytic graphite electrode .</dc:description>

      <title>Tailored Catalytic Nanoframes from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Anisotropic Surface Modification and Etching</title>
      <dc:description>The rational design and synthesis of frame&#8208;like hollow structures with unique three&#8208;dimensional open architectures for their diverse applications is still challenging. We herein propose a facile anisotropic surface modification and etching strategy for the synthesis of hollow structured ZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. Our strategy relies on the structural and compositional distinctions between each crystallographic facet of truncated rhombic dodecahedrons ZIF&#8208;67 (tZIF&#8208;67 RDs) and the moderate coordinating and etching effects of cyanuric acid (CA). Thereby, the CA can anisotropically modify and protect the {110} facets from etching, causing the six {100} facets be selectively etched via an inside&#8208;out manner, and finally forming the hollow nanoframes. Interestingly, the surface modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 RDs can further be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts via an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. After calcination in reducing atmosphere, the metal&#8208;tZIF&#8208;67 hydrids are converted into metal&#8208;Co alloy/C composite catalysts with hollow nanoframed structures. Among them, the PtCo/C catalyst with only 5.9 wt.% Pt exhibits high catalytic activities and stabilities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions, outperforming the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Our results offer insight into the development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with compositional and structural multiplicity, which in turn could encourages more practical catalytic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>The Trojan Horse Goes Wild: The Effect of Drug Loading on the Behavior of Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Drug delivery is often compared to a Trojan Horse, as the drugs are hidden inside nanoparticles (equivalent to the Trojan Horse) and they enter cells (e.g. cancer cells) in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. However, it seems that drug loading can influence the properties of the nanoparticles, which are detected by the cell. As a result, the cell can reject the nanoparticle; thus, loading large amounts of drugs can be damaging to drug delivery efforts.







Abstract
Drug delivery with nanoparticles is sometimes compared to an attack with a Trojan Horse. The drugs are hidden in nanoparticles and enter the unsuspecting cells in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. Here, I would like to share my thoughts that a comparison to the Trojan Horse does not always apply, and provide examples where an increased drug loading content was detrimental to the drug&#8208;delivery process. The purpose is to highlight the importance of understanding the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, and the importance of having materials scientists in the line&#8208;up of researchers working together to create successful nanomedicine.

The purpose is to highlight the importance of understanding the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, and the importance of having materials scientists in the line&#8208;up of researchers working together to create successful nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photoacoustic Cavitation&#8208;Ignited Reactive Oxygen Species to Amplify Peroxynitrite Burst by Photosensitization&#8208;free Polymeric Nanocapsules</title>
      <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) technology can transform light energy into acoustic wave   , which  can be used for either imaging or therapy that depends on the power density of pulsed laser. Here, we report photosensitizer&#8208;free polymeric nanocapsules loaded with nitric oxide (NO) donors, namely NO&#8208;NCPs, formulated from  NIR light&#8208;absorbable amphiphilic polymers  and a NO&#8208;releasing donor, DETA NONOate. Controlled NO release and nanocapsule dissociation are achieved in acidic lysosomes of cancer cells. More importantly, upon pulsed laser irradiation, the PA cavitation can excite water to generate significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical (O  2  &#8226;&#8208;  ), which further spontaneously reacts with the  in&#8208;situ  released NO to burst highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO  &#8208;  ) in cancer cells. The resultant ONOO  &#8208;  generation greatly promotes mitochondrial damage and DNA fragmentation to initiate programmed cancer cell death. Apart from PA imaging, PA cavitation can intrinsically amplify reactive species via photosensitization&#8208;free materials for promising disease theranostics.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Active Cooperative Lewis Acid &#8211; Ammonium Salt Catalyst for the Enantioselective Hydroboration of Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>Enantiopure secondary alcohols are fundamental high&#8208;value synthetic building blocks. One of the most attractive ways to get access to this compound class is the catalytic hydroboration. We describe a new concept for this reaction type which allowed for exceptional catalytic turnover numbers (up to 15400), which were increased by around 1.5&#8208;3 orders of magnitude compared to the most active catalysts previously reported. In our concept an aprotic ammonium halide moiety cooperates with an oxophilic Lewis acid within the same catalyst molecule. Control experiments reveal that both catalytic centers are essential for the observed activity. Kinetic, spectroscopic and computational studies show that the hydride transfer is rate limiting and proceeds via a concerted mechanism, in which hydride at B is continuously &#160;displaced by iodide, reminiscent to an S  N  2 reaction.

The development of tau&#8208;targeting therapies is therefore extremely important but efficient strategies or protein targets are still unclear. Here, we performed a cell&#8208;based phenotypic screening under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions and identified a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal tau protein aggregation. By applying label&#8208;free target identification technology, we revealed that the transient enhancement of protein kinase&#8208;like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling pathway through the inhibition of stress&#8208;responsive SB1617 targets, PDIA3 and DNAJC3, is an effective strategy for regulating proteostasis in tauopathies.

      <title>Activation of Aptamers with Gain&#8208;of&#8208;Function by Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Clipping of Intramolecular Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>Click reactions, which are commonly used in the challenging task of biology&#8208;oriented modular conjugation, have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility, and they accelerate the generation of molecules possessing well&#8208;de&#64257;ned functions. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers,&#8221; whose binding affinity is regulated by the "clip"&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de novo selection of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; can achieve the efficient transition from a binding inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results proved that the &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Click reactions, which are commonly used in the challenging task of biology&#8208;oriented modular conjugation, have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility, and they accelerate the generation of molecules possessing well&#8208;de&#64257;ned functions. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers,&#8221; whose binding affinity is regulated by the "clip"&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de novo selection of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; can achieve the efficient transition from a binding inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results proved that the &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Observing single&#8208;atom catalytic sites during reactions with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have become a prominent theme in heterogeneous catalysis, not least because of the potential fundamental insight into active sites. The desired level of understanding, however, is prohibited due to the inhomogeneity of most supported SACs and the lack of suitable tools for structure&#8208;activity correlation studies with atomic resolution. Herein, we describe the potency of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) to study molecularly defined SACs supported on polyoxometalates in catalytic reactions. We were able to identify the exact composition of active sites and their evolution in the catalytic cycle during CO and alcohol oxidation reactions performed in the liquid phase. Critical information on metal&#8208;dependent reaction mechanisms, the key intermediates, the dynamics of active sites and even the stepwise activation barriers were obtained, which would be challenging to gather via prevailingly adopted techniques in SAC research. DFT calculations revealed intricate details of the reaction mechanisms, and strong synergies between ESI&#8208;MS defined SAC sites and electronic structure theory calculations become apparent.</dc:description>

      <title>Dimer organization of membrane&#8208;associated NS5A of hepatitis C virus as determined by highly sensitive&#160;1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
      <dc:description>The Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane&#8208;associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct&#8208;acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane&#8208;bound NS5A structure. Here we present the structural model of an NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated&#160;via&#160;synthetic biology approaches.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane&#8208;associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct&#8208;acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane&#8208;bound NS5A structure. Here we present the structural model of an NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated&#160;via&#160;synthetic biology approaches. Spectra analyses disclose that both the AH membrane anchor and the linker are highly flexible. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) reveal that the dimer organization in lipids requires a new type of NS5A self&#8208;interaction not reflected in previous crystal structures. In conclusion, we provide the&#160;first characterization&#160;of NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 in a lipidic environment shedding light onto the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of clinically used NS5A inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>C&#8211;H Activation by an Iron&#8208;Nitrido Bis&#8208;Pocket Porphyrin Species</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;nitrido species are nitrogen analogues of iron&#8208;oxo species which are versatile reagents for C&#8211;H oxidation. Nonetheless, C&#8211;H activation by iron&#8208;nitrido species has been scarcely explored, as this is often hampered by their instability and short lifetime in solutions. Herein, the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactivity of an Fe porphyrin nitrido species (  2c  ) toward C&#8211;H substrates was studied in solutions at room temperature, which was achieved by nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) of its Fe(III)&#8208;azido precursor (  1c  ) supported by a bulky bis&#8208;pocket porphyrin ligand. C&#8211;H bonds with bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of up to ~84 kcal mol  &#8208;1  could be activated, and the second&#8208;order rate constants (  k  2  ) are on the order of 10  2  &#8211;10  4  s  &#8208;1  M  &#8208;1  . The Fe&#8208;amido product formed after HAT could further release ammonia upon protonation.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkanes Enabled by Multifunctional Trifluoromethyl Copper&#160;Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the extensive development in trifluoromethylation, introduction of a trifluoromethyl group into an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond is significantly challenging. Herein, we report the development of a mild and operationally simple C(sp3)&#8211;H trifluoromethylation method for unactivated alkanes utilizing a bench&#8208;stable Cu(III) complex, bpyCu(CF3)3, as a visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;induced reaction initiator, a trifluoromethyl radical source as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and a trifluoromethyl anion source for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by reactive electrophilic carbon&#8208;centered CF3 radical generation from photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF3)3, which performs hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C&#8211;CF3 bond formation was enabled by radical&#8208;polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF3 source. The newly developed reaction can be applied to various methylene selective trifluoromethylation reactions including direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Improved Asparaginyl Ligase&#8208;catalyzed Transpeptidation via Selective Nucleophile Quenching</title>
      <dc:description>The use of enzymes for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins/peptides has become a highly accessible, widespread approach to study protein/peptide functions or to generate therapeutic conjugates. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) that preferentially catalyze transpeptidation reactions (AEP ligases) have emerged as enticing alternatives to established approaches, such as bacterial sortases, due to their catalytic efficiency and short tripeptide recognition motifs. However, under standard conditions, a substantial excess of the nucleophile to be conjugated is needed to reach desirable yields. Herein we report a versatile approach to shift the AEP&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation equilibrium toward product formation via selectively quenching the nucleophilicity of the competing leaving group peptide. Our metal complexation&#8208;based strategy enables efficient peptide/protein labeling at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus with near&#8208;equimolar concentrations of nucleophile label. Furthermore, we show that this approach can enhance protein&#8208;protein ligation and facilitate the formation of transpeptidation products that are otherwise unattainable.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Selective N&#8208;Formylation of Amines with CO2 and H2 Catalyzed by Porous Organometallic Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to fine chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for CO2  capture and utilization. Herein we demonstrated a series of porous organometallic polymers could be employed as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for this purpose. Synergetic effects of specific surface area, iridium content, and CO2  adsorption capability are crucial to achieve excellent selectivity and yields towards N&#8208;formylation of diverse amines with CO2  and H2  under mild reaction conditions even at 20 ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory calculations revealed not only a redox&#8208;neutral catalytic pathway but also a new plausible mechanism with the incorporation of the key intermediate formic acid via a proton&#8208;relay process. Remarkably, a record turnover number (TON = 1.58 &#215; 106  ) was achieved in the synthesis of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), and the solid catalysts can be reused up to 12 runs, highlighting their practical potential in industry.</dc:description>

      <title>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of chemically and biologically diverse pyrroquinoline pseudo natural products</title>
      <dc:description>Natural product (NP) structure is a rich source of inspiration for the discovery of new biologically relevant chemical matter. In natural product inspired pseudo&#8208;NPs, NP&#8208;derived fragments are combined de novo to unprecedented arrangements.

We describe the design and synthesis of a 155&#8208;membered pyrroquinoline pseudo&#8208;NP collection in which fragments characteristic of the tetrahydroquinoline&#8208; and pyrrolidine NP classes are combined in eight different connectivities and regioisomeric arrangements. Cheminformatic analysis and biological evaluation of the compound collection by means of phenotyping in the morphological &#8220;cell painting&#8221; assay followed by principal component analysis revealed that the pseudo&#8208;NP classes are chemically diverse and that bioactivity patterns markedly differ dependent of connectivity and regioisomeric arrangement of the fragments.</dc:description>

      <title>The Challenge of Peptide Proteolytic Stability Studies: Scarce Data, Difficult Readability, and the Need for Harmonization</title>
      <dc:description>
The assessment of peptide stability is a fundamental component of peptide characterization. Researchers can find numerous methods in the literature to assess stability. However, in general, the results are not comparable, since a given technique possesses certain specificities. Another major fault is the stability report. The lack of harmonization hampers a proper comparison of data, which makes their interpretation more demanding.







Abstract
Proteolytic stability assessment is increasingly viewed as a fundamental component of peptide characterization, arguably of comparable importance as efficacy and toxicity data. A literature survey over the last decade reveals steady growth in the stability information available. However, it also uncovers two significant problems that hinder proper data comparison: 1)&#8197;the use of different stability assays, and 2)&#8197;the differences in how stability information is reported. In this Viewpoint, we present results from a database meta&#8208;analysis as well as concerns about the stability assessments published so far. We also suggest guidelines for a proper discussion between experts in the field on how to improve data readability so that peptide stability, an often&#8208;missing parameter in older literature, is adequately reported to take maximum advantage of it.

      <title>Observation of the Reaction Intermediates of Methanol Dehydrogenation by Cationic Vanadium Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Detection and characterization of fleeting reaction intermediates and active sites are crucial for molecular&#8208;level knowledge of catalysis; insight that is required to understand the catalytic mechanisms, and to design novel high performance catalysts. We report a mass spectrometric study of the reactions of 3d early transition metal (vanadium, [Ar]3d  3  4s  2  ) cationic clusters with methanol in a low&#8208;pressure collision cell. For comparison, the reaction of methanol with 3d late transition metal (cobalt, [Ar]3d  7  4s  2  ) cationic clusters were studied as well. In the vanadium case, the main reaction products are fully dehydrogenated species, and partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species are observed as minors, for which the relative intensities increase with cluster size and also at low cluster source temperature cooled by liquid nitrogen; while no dehydrogenation products have been observed for cobalt clusters. That demonstrates the strikingly different reactivity of vanadium and cobalt cationic clusters towards methanol. Quantum chemical calculations explored the reaction pathways and revealed that the fully dehydrogenation products of the reaction between V  n  +  and methanol are V  n  (C)(O)  +  , in which C and O are separated due to the high oxophilicity of vanadium. The partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species observed in the experiment are verified to be reaction intermediates along the reaction pathway, and their most probable structures have been proposed.</dc:description>

      <title>Silver in the Center Enhances Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Platinum Sub&#8208;nanocluster by 18 times</title>
      <dc:description>There has been a controversy surrounding the roles of the metal core (metal&#8208;metal interaction) and the shell (metal&#8208;ligand interaction) in photoluminescence of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters. Our group has discovered aggregation&#8208;induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of platinum&#8208;thiolate complex and its silver ion inclusion complex (i.e. silver doped platinum sub&#8208;nanocluster). The inclusion of silver ion has boosted photoluminescent quantum yield by 18 times. The results of photophysical measurements indicated that the rate of nonradiative decay was slower for silver doped platinum sub&#8208;nanocluster. Density functional theory calculations showed that the LUMO, which had the main contribution from Ag  s  &#8208;orbital and Pt  d  &#8208;orbitals, played a critical role in suppressing the structural distortion at the excited state. This work is hoped to stimulate more experimental and theoretical research on the designing strategies based on molecular orbitals of atomicity&#8208;precise luminescent multimetallic nanoclusters.</dc:description>

      <title>Effective enantioselective recognition by chiral amino&#8208;phosphonium salts</title>
      <dc:description>The research on chiral recognition and selection is not only fundamental in deciding the mystery of homochirality, but also informative in terms of substrate recognition in biological processes and asymmetric catalysis. We report an enantiomeric pair of phosphonium salts having chiral (R and S) amino substituents that are utilized&#160;towards the enantioselective recognition of a variety of chiral compounds having functional groups such as carboxylic acid, amine, and alcohol. These simple phosphonium salts are found to exhibit an extremely high enantiomeric discrimination for 1&#8208;cyclohexylethylamine (CY). A remarkable guest selectivity (&#958;) value of 5.3 X 10  8  for the enantiomer of  S  &#8208;CY over  R  &#8208;CY is achieved by using the R&#8208;isomer of the aminophosphonium salt . Such high binding selectivities and discrimination capabilities may be attributed to&#160; multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the host and guest molecules as inferred from the DFT optimized structures of the host&#8208;guest pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Red Phosphors and Their Core&#8208;Shell Structure for Improved Water&#8208;Resistance for Laser Diodes Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Single crystal luminescence materials usually show higher luminous efficiency and better stability than a powdery one. Poor water resistance of Mn  4+  doped powdery fluoride red phosphors limits their further application for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) with high color rendering index. In this report, we have presented a solvent&#8208;vapor transport route for centimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal red phosphor development. As a side benefit, the epitaxial growth route to yield its core&#8208;shell structure at ambient temperature was adopted. These single&#8208;crystal red phosphors could be applied in all&#8208;inorganic WLED devices without any organic resin. Cs  2  TiF  6  :Mn  4+  (CTFM) single crystal provides a significant enhancement of quantum efficiency, moisture resistance, and thermal stability as compared to its polycrystalline powders. Particularly, the internal quantum efficiency can reach as high as 98.7%. To further improve waterproof stability, the Cs  2  TiF  6  (CTF) shell with tunable thickness has been epitaxially grown on the CTFM single crystal surface and a unique three&#8208;step photoluminescence intensity evolution mechanism has been proposed. By combining as&#8208;prepared CTFM@CTF core&#8208;shell structured single crystal, YAG:Ce single crystal and blue&#8208;chip, warm WLEDs with excellent color rendition (R  a  = 90, R  9  = 94), low correlated color temperature (CCT = 3155 K), and high luminous efficacy have been fabricated without any organic resins.

      <title>Kinetic Barriers and Microscopic Mechanisms of Noble Gas Adsorption by Nanoporous &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2 Obtained by means of Sub&#8208;Second X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>Gas adsorption by porous frameworks sometimes result in structure &#8220;breathing&#8221;, &#8220;pores opening/closing&#8221;, &#8220;negative gas adsorption&#8221;, and other fascinating phenomena   which can be revealed and explained with the use of  in situ  diffraction methods. The time&#8208;dependent diffraction is able to address both kinetics of the guest uptake and structural response of the host framework, since the time evolution of the crystal structure bears the information on the mechanisms and kinetic barriers of guest adsorption.  Using such advanced sub&#8208;second  in situ  powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, three various intracrystalline diffusion scenarios have been evaluated from the isothermal kinetics of Ar, Kr, and Xe adsorption by nanoporous &#947;&#8209;Mg(BH4)2. These scenarios are dictated by  two possible simultaneous transport mechanisms: diffusion through the intra&#8208; (i) and interchannel apertures (ii) of  &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2  crystal structure. The contribution of i and ii changes depending on the kinetic diameter of the noble gas molecule and temperature regime.  The lowest single activation barrier for the smallest Ar suggests equal diffusion of the atoms trough both pathways. Contrary, for the medium sized Kr we resolve the contributions of two parallel transport mechanisms, which tentatively can be attributed to the smaller  barrier of the migration paths  via  the channel like pores and the higher barrier for the diffusion  via  &#160; narrow aperture between these channels. Remarkably, the largest Xe atoms diffuse only along 1D channels and show the highest single activation barrier. This work demonstrates a potential of sub&#8208;second diffraction to access site&#8208;specific kinetics of guest uptake in multi&#8208;adsorption site frameworks.</dc:description>

Here we developed a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) amorphous BiNi alloy toward a significantly enhanced NRR compared with its crystalline and metal counterparts.

The enhanced electron transfer and increased electrochemical surface area were revealed in the interconnected porous scaffold, allowing its sufficiently efficient and stable activity for potential practical applications.

      <title>Dynamic Activation of Adsorped Intermediates via Axial Traction for the Promoted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (e.g., M&#8208;N4) to accelerate overall reaction dynamics of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of M&#8208;N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C). The Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100% at &#8208;0.9 V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90% in a wide range of potential window from &#8208;0.5 to &#8208;1.1 V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O active moiety composed of a Ni&#8208;N4 site with an additional oxygen ligand that induces an axial traction effect. The unique structure was evidenced by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the introduction of axial oxygen atom could optimize surface states of Ni&#8208;N4 moieties and enhance the charge polarization effect, therefore decreasing the potential barrier of intermediate COOH* formation, a key factor to accelerate the reaction kinetics and boost the CO2RR performance.</dc:description>

However, a comprehensive understanding on the intrinsic driving force of electron&#8208;donating effect is lacking, let alone the precise manipulation of electron donation processes.

The energy was also transferred to O2 and elevated the potential energy surface (PES) of MOA, which was reflected by the enhanced formation of superoxide oxygen anions. As predicted, the Ea of MOA decreased by 45.3% and exhibited a substantial light dependence, demonstrating that MOA became energy&#8208;efficient due to improved exploitation and conversion of photon energies.</dc:description>

Therefore, new and efficient methods for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides is highly in demand. In contrast to extensive studies on FSO2+ type reagents, a radical fluorosulfonylation reaction with fluorosulfonyl radical (FSO2  &#8226;) remains elusive so far, probably due to its instability and difficulty in generation. Here, we report the development of the first radical fluorosulfonylation of alkenes based on FSO2  radicals generated under photoredox conditions. This radical approach provides a new and general access to alkenyl sulfonyl fluorides, including structures that would otherwise be challenging to synthesize with previously established cross coupling methods. Moreover, further extention to the late&#8208;stage fluorosulfonylation of natural products is also demonstrated.</dc:description>
