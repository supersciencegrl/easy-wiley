         <title>Synthesis and Degradation of Vinyl Polymers with Evenly&#160;Distributed Thioacetal Bonds in Main Chains: Cationic DT Copolymerization of Vinyl Ethers and Cyclic Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel method to synthesize degradable poly(vinyl ether)s with cleavable thioacetal bonds periodically arranged in the main chains using controlled cationic copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal (7&#8208;CTA) via degenerative chain transfer (DT) to the internal thioacetal bonds. The thioacetal bonds, which are introduced into the main chain by cationic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of 7&#8208;CTA with vinyl ethers, serve as in&#8208;chain dormant species to allow homogeneous propagation of vinyl ethers for all internal segments to afford copolymers with controlled overall and segmental molecular weights. The obtained polymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions via hydrolysis. Various vinyl ethers with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and functional pendants are available. Finally, one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers are also achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead&#8208;free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn2+ to Sn4+ remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its role on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution on improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Water as an Initial Proton Source for the Electrochemical CO Reduction Reaction on Copper Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we used in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces under various conditions. Coadsorbed and structure&#8208;/potential&#8208;dependent surface species, including *CO, Cu&#8208;Oad, and Cu&#8208;OHad, were identified using electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope labeling. The relative abundance of *OH follows a &#8216;volcano&#8217; trend with applied potentials in aqueous solutions, which is yet absent in absolute alcoholic solutions.&#160;Combined with DFT calculations, we propose that the surface H2O can serve as a strong proton donor for the first protonation step in both the C1 and C2 pathways of CORR at various applied potentials in alkaline electrolytes, leaving adsorbed *OH on the surface. This work provides fresh insights into the initial protonation steps and identity of key interfacial intermediates formed during CORR on Cu surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Presodiation with Sodium Diphenyl Ketone towards Ultra&#8208;stable Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) is applied to realize dual&#8208;function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven&#8208;membered rings for quasi&#8208;metallic sodium in HC. The as&#8208;formed sodium induces robust NaF&#8208;rich SEI on HC in 1.0 M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of ~100% and capacity retention of 82.4% after 6800 cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of ~100% after 700 cycles. This work provides in&#8208;depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Mutability&#8208;Landscape&#8208;Guided Engineering of l&#8208;Threonine Aldolase Revealing the Prelog Rule in Mediating Diastereoselectivity of C&#8208;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>l&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA) catalyses C&#8208;C bond synthesis with moderate diastereoselectivity. Here, with LTA from Cellulosilyticum sp (CpLTA) as an object, a mutability landscape was first constructed by performing saturation mutagenesis at substrate access tunnel amino acids. CAST/ISM strategy was then performed to tune diastereoselectivity. As a result, diastereoselectivity of mutant H305L/Y8H/V143R was improved from 37.2% syn  to 99.4% syn . Besides, diastereoselectivity of mutant H305Y/Y8I/W307E was inverted to 97.2% anti . Based on insights provided by the molecular dynamics simulations and coevolution analysis, the Prelog rule was employed to illustrate diastereoselectivity regulation mechanism of LTA, holding that the asymmetric formation of C&#8208;C bond was caused by electrons attacking the carbonyl carbon atoms of substrate aldehyde from re or si faces. The study would be useful to expand LTA applications and guide engineering of other C&#8208;C bond formation enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Organosulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Hosts Enabled by C@Fe3N Sponge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;organosulfur (Li&#8208;OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li&#8208;OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well&#8208;designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe3N nanoparticles (C@Fe3N) is introduced into the Li&#8208;OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe3N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1,000 cycles in a Li&#8208;OS full cell under realistic conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To understand the role of structure imperfections on the performance of electrochromic transition metal oxide (ETMO) is a fascinating topic yet challenging to design efficient smart windows. Here, we investigate the performance evolution with tunable crystallographic imperfections for rutile TiO  2  nanowire film (TNF). Structure imperfections, originating mainly from the copious oxygen deficiency, are apt to cumulatively retard the shuttling ions, resulting in the response rate for raw TNF less than the half for TNF annealed at 500 &#176;C. We describe ion accommodation sites as a convolution of normal site and abnormal site, in which the normal site performs reversible coloration but the abnormal site contributes only to charge storage, to give a rationale for the non&#8208;linear coloration and rate capability loss. These findings render a clear picture for the ion shuttling process, hence insightful to enhance the electrochromic performance via structure reprogramming.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Activity and Stability in Spinel Cobalt Oxides through Geometrical Sites Occupation towards Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are vitally important to various energy conversion devices. Herein, we introduce elements Ni and Mn into (Co)tet(Co2)octO4 nanosheets (NSs) at fixed geometrical sites, including &#160;Mnoct, Nioct, and Nitet, to optimize the initial geometrical structure and modulate the CoCo2O4 surface from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficiency. The pristine (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs shows excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 281.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, without damaging their initial activity, the activated (Act)&#8208;(Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs after surface reconstruction exhibit long&#8208;term stability of 100 h under 10 mA cm&#8208;2, 50 mA cm&#8208;2, or even 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The optimal balance between electroactivity and stability leads to remarkable OER performances, providing a pivotal guideline for designing ideal electrocatalysts and inspiring more works to focus on the dynamic change of each occupation site component.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;Modulated Enhancements of Proton Conductivity in Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We proposed a new strategy to maximize the density of acidic groups by modulating the electronic effects of the substituents for high&#8208;performance proton conductors. The conductivity of the sulfonated  1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  with methyl group corresponds to 2.25 &#215; 10  &#8208;1  S cm  &#8208;1  at 80  o  C and 90% relative humidity, remarkably an 18600&#8208;fold enhancement over the nonsulfonated  1&#8208;MeL40. 1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  maintains long&#8208;term conductivity for one month. We confirm that this synthetic method is generalized to the extended version POPs,  2&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  and  3&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S  . In particular, the conductivities of the POPs compete with those of top&#8208;level porous organic conductors. Moreover, the activation energy of the POPs is lower than that of the top&#8208;performing materials. This study demonstrates that systematic alteration of the electronic effects of substituents is a useful route to improve the conductivity and long&#8208;term durability of proton&#8208;conducting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoporous Films with Oriented Arrays of Molecular Motors for Light&#8208;Controlled Adsorption and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a sever challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom&#8208;up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oriented overcrowded&#8208;alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded&#8208;alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light&#8208;induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film&#8217; transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. By gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta&#8208;)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbon Nanotube Binding BODIPY&#8208;C60 Nano Tweezer: Charge Stabilization through Sequential Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy has been developed to generate long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states in single&#8208;wall nanocarbon&#8208;derived multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids having different diameters. The occurrence of photoexcited electron transfer was demonstrated by employing a variety of physicochemical and transient absorption spectral studies that cover a wide spatial and temporal range.







Abstract
Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (DA) hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising functional materials for light energy conversion. However, the DA hybrids built on SWCNTs have failed to reveal the much&#8208;sought long&#8208;lived charge separation (CS) due to the close proximity of the DA entities facilitating charge recombination. Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi&#8208;modular DA hybrids capable of producing long&#8208;lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V&#8208;shape configured BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;&#8208;stacking. Supported by spectral, electrochemical, and computational studies, the established energy scheme revealed the possibility of sequential electron transfer. Systematic pump&#8208;probe studies covering wide spatial and temporal scales provided evidence of CS from the initial 1BODIPY* ultimately resulting in C60&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;SWCNT&#8901;+ CS states of lifetimes in the 20&#8208;microsecond range.

         <title>Assessing the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Mice Using a Fluorescence Nanosensor for the Simultaneous Detection and Imaging of pH and Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inflammatory microenvironment involves changes in pH and protein phosphorylation has closely related to the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis (AS). Herein, we constructed a dual&#8208;detection fluorescence nanosensor PCN&#8208;NP&#8208;HPZ based on post modification of MOFs, which realized the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation through the pH sensitive group piperazine and the Zr(IV) node of MOFs. The sensors were used to track changes in blood pH and phosphate levels at different time stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was also performed in vascular endothelium. Blood tests combined with two&#8208;photon fluorescence images indicated that in the early stage of AS, blood and tissue pH levels were lower than that of the normal mice, while phosphate and tissue phosphorylation levels were higher than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Chiral Molecular Carbon Imides Featuring 12&#8208;Fold [5]helicenes Around Four Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great progress in research on molecular carbons containing multiple helicenes around one core, realizing the stereoselectivity of carbons containing multiple helicenes around more cores is still a great challenge. Herein, molecular carbon C204 featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores was successfully constructed by using nine perylene diimide (PDI) units, which exhibits good solubility and stability. Despite 256 possible stereoisomers caused by the 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes, we only obtained one pair of enantiomers with D3 symmetry. There are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, namely 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D. Theoretical and experimental results verify that the obtained structure belongs to 7C which has the lowest energy. The enantiomers are also separated by chiral HPLC. These results suggest that choosing PDIs as building blocks can not only improve the solubility and stability but also realize the stereoselectivity and chirality of molecular carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophoresis&#8208;Assisted Multilayer Assembly of Nanoparticles for Sensitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a rapid, simple, and inexpensive point&#8208;of&#8208;need method. A major limitation of LFIA is a high limit of detection (LOD), which impacts its diagnostic sensitivity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a signal&#8208;enhancement procedure that is performed after completing LFIA and involves controllably moving biotin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles by electrophoresis. The nanoparticles link to immunocomplexes forming multilayer aggregates on the test strip, thus, enhancing the signal. Here, we demonstrate lowering the LOD of hepatitis B surface antigen from approximately 8 to 0.12 ng/mL, making it clinically acceptable. Testing 118 clinical samples for hepatitis B showed that signal enhancement increased the diagnostic sensitivity of LFIA from 73% to 98% while not affecting its 95% specificity. Electrophoresis&#8208;driven enhancement of LFIA is universal (antigen&#8208;independent), takes two minutes, and can be performed by an untrained person.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams with organoboronate esters could provide the synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#946;&#8208;lactams. The challenge arises mainly from the construction of sterically congested quaternary stereocenters between the tertiary alkyl radicals and chiral copper(II) species. Herein, we describe our success in achieving such transformations through the utilization of a copper/hemilabile N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst to forge the sterically congested chiral C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond via a single&#8208;electron reduction/transmetalation/bond formation catalytic cycle. The synthetic potential of this approach is shown in the straightforward conversion of the corresponding products into many valuable building blocks. We hope that the developed catalytic cycle would open up new vistas for more enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Chiral Open [60]Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though [60]fullerene is an achiral molecular nanocarbon with Ih symmetry, it could attain an inherent chirality depending upon a functionalization pattern. The conventional chiral induction of C60 relies mainly upon a multiple addition affording a mixture of achiral and chiral isomers while their chiral function would be largely offset by the existence of pseudo&#8208;mirror plane(s). These are major obstacles to proceed further study on fullerene chirality and yet leave its understanding elusive. Herein, we showcase a carbene&#8208;mediated synthesis of C1&#8208;symmetric chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes showing an intense far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The large dissymmetry factor of |gabs| = 0.12 was achieved at &#955; = 820 nm for circular dichroism in benzonitrile. This is, in general, unachievable by other small chiral organic molecules, demonstrating the potential usage of open&#8208;[60]fullerenes as novel types of chiral chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Electron&#8208;Rich Ruthenium Atoms in Intermetallic Compounds for Boosting Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct electrochemical nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) is an attractive technique for converting NO into NH3 with low power consumption under ambient conditions. Optimizing the electronic structure of the active sites can greatly improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepare body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method. The electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable NH4+ yield rate of 320.6 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1Ru with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.3% at very low potential of &#8208;0.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in neutral media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electron&#8208;rich Ru atoms in bcc RuGa IMCs facilitate the adsorption and activation of *HNO intermediate. Hence, the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in NORR could be greatly reduced.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For emerging perovskite quantum dots (QDs), understanding the surface features and their impact on the materials and devices is becoming increasingly urgent. In this family, hybrid FAPbI3 QDs (FA: formamidium), exhibit advantages like higher ambient stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption and sufficient carrier lifetime. However, hybrid QDs suffer from difficulty in modulating surface ligand, which is essential for constructing conductive QD arrays for photovoltaics. Herein, assisted by an ionic liquid formamidine thiocyanate, we report a facile surface reconfiguration methodology to modulate surface and manipulate electronic coupling of FAPbI3 QDs, which is exploited to enhance charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and photovoltaic devices. Finally, a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15% is achieved for FAPbI3 QD solar cells, and they retain over 80% of the initial efficiency after aging in ambient environment (20&#8208;30% humidity, 25 oC) for over 600 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8211;Air Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using light to drive slow cathode kinetics has been explored as a promising solution to unlock the high theoretical specific energy of metal&#8211;air batteries. This Review summarizes the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries, discusses the significant influence of light on battery systems, and identifies existing gaps and future priorities.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;air batteries are considered one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical specific energy. However, sluggish cathode kinetics (O2 and CO2 reduction/evolution) result in large overpotentials and low round&#8208;trip efficiencies which seriously hinder their practical applications. Utilizing light to drive slow cathode processes has increasingly becoming a promising solution to this issue.

&lt;p&gt;Using light to drive slow cathode kinetics has been explored as a promising solution to unlock the high theoretical specific energy of metal&#8211;air batteries. This Review summarizes the current understanding of light-assisted metal&#8211;air batteries, discusses the significant influence of light on battery systems, and identifies existing gaps and future priorities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;air batteries are considered one of the most promising next-generation energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical specific energy. However, sluggish cathode kinetics (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction/evolution) result in large overpotentials and low round-trip efficiencies which seriously hinder their practical applications. Utilizing light to drive slow cathode processes has increasingly becoming a promising solution to this issue. Considering the rapid development and emerging issues of this field, this Review summarizes the current understanding of light-assisted metal&#8211;air batteries in terms of configurations and mechanisms, provides general design strategies and specific examples of photocathodes, systematically discusses the influence of light on batteries, and finally identifies existing gaps and future priorities for the development of practical light-assisted metal&#8211;air batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Deaminative Amino&#8208; and Alkoxycarbonylation of Aryl Trialkylammonium Salts Promoted by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light via a challenging C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation and SNAr&#8208;type oxidative addition.







Abstract
Catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles via C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light with a simple cobalt catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. A range of alkylamines are successful partners, and alkoxycarbonylation is also demonstrated. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism for catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Homologation of Carbonyl Compounds for Iterative Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced B&#252;chner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck type reaction for carbonyl homologation is described. The protocol allows the use of carbonyl compounds as safe and readily available diazo precursors through direct photoexcitation of corresponding N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anion. Functionalized aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are prepared in a practical and iterative manner.







Abstract
We describe a photo&#8208;induced reaction for the in situ generation of highly reactive alkyl diazo species from carbonyl precursors via photo&#8208;excitation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. The diazo intermediates undergo efficient C&#8722;H insertion of aldehydes, leading to the productive synthesis of aldehydes and ketones. The method is applicable to the iterative synthesis of densely functionalized carbonyl compounds through sequential trapping of the diazo species with various aldehydes. The reaction proceeds without the need of any catalyst by light irradiation and features high functional group tolerance. More than 70 examples, some performed on a gram&#8208;scale, demonstrate the broad applicability of this reaction sequence in synthesis.

         <title>NaCdSb: An Orthorhombic Zintl Phase with Exceptional Intrinsic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance Zintl phase thermoelectric material NaCdSb has a peak figure of merit zT=1.3 at 673&#8197;K without any doping optimization or structural modification. This compound exhibits intrinsic semiconductor behavior, and the hole concentration approaches optimal as the temperature rises, leading to high power factors. The ultralow thermal conductivity is achieved through the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds.







Abstract
Many Zintl phases are promising thermoelectric materials owning to their features like narrow band gaps, multiband behaviors, ideal charge transport tunnels, and loosely bound cations. Herein we show a new Zintl phase NaCdSb with exceptional intrinsic thermoelectric performance. Pristine NaCdSb exhibits semiconductor behaviors with an experimental hole concentration of 2.9&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 and a calculated band gap of 0.5&#8197;eV. As the temperature increases, the hole concentration rises gradually and approaches its optimal one, leading to a high power factor of 11.56&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 at 673&#8197;K. The ultralow thermal conductivity is derived from the small phonon group velocity and short phonon lifetime, ascribed to the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8722;Sb bonds. As a consequence, a maximum zT of 1.3 at 673&#8197;K has been achieved without any doping optimization or structural modification, demonstrating that NaCdSb is a remarkable thermoelectric compound with great potential for performance improvement.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. Two critical carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates in the catalytic reactions were captured by deep UV detection, and their dynamics were determined with actual reaction timescales, revealing the molecular mechanism of the enzymatic reaction and mapping out the catalytic photocycle of this efficient photoenzyme.







Abstract
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase is a newly discovered flavin photoenzyme that converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. The enzymatic reactions are poorly understood. In this study, we carefully characterized its dynamic evolution with femtosecond spectroscopy. We observed initial electron transfer from the substrate to the flavin cofactor in 347&#8197;ps with a stretched dynamic behavior and subsequently captured the critical carbonyloxy radical. The dominant process following this step was decarboxylation in 5.8&#8197;ns to form an alkyl radical and a carbon dioxide molecule. We further identified the absorption bands of two carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates. The overall enzymatic quantum efficiency determined by our obtained timescales is 0.81, consistent with the steady&#8208;state value. The results are essential to the elucidation of the enzyme mechanism and catalytic photocycle, providing a molecular basis for potential design of flavin&#8208;based artificial photoenzymes.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Controlled Substrate Engineering Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Enzymatic Fucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A galactose oxidase&#8208;mediated redox system was coupled with enzymatic modular assembly strategy to control the site&#8208;selectivity of &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation. This redox&#8208;controlled site&#8208;specific fucosylation strategy provides a general and operational simple approach for the precisely enzymatic synthesis of various complex fucosylated oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) containing O&#8208; and N&#8208;glycans with defined fucosylation patterns.







Abstract
Fucosylation is one of the most common modifications of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) glycans. However, none of known fucosyltransferases (FucTs) could install the &#945;1,3&#8208;linked fucose to the oligo&#8208;LacNAc substrates in a site&#8208;specific manner. Here, we report a facile and general redox&#8208;controlled substrate engineering strategy for the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation of complex glycans containing multiple LacNAc units. This strategy takes advantage of an operationally simple oxidation enzyme module by using galactose oxidase (GOase) to convert the LacNAc unit into oxidized C6&#8242;&#8208;aldehyde LacNAc sequence, which is not a good substrate for recombinant &#945;1,3&#8208;FucT from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 (Hp&#945;1,3FucT), enabling the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation at intact LacNAc sites. The general applicability and robustness of this strategy were demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of structurally well&#8208;defined fucosides of linear and branched O&#8208; and N&#8208;linked glycans.

This strategy takes advantage of an operationally simple oxidation enzyme module by using galactose oxidase (GOase) to convert the LacNAc unit into oxidized C6&#8242;-aldehyde LacNAc sequence, which is not a good substrate for recombinant &#945;1,3-FucT from &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; strain 26695 (Hp&#945;1,3FucT), enabling the site-specific &#945;1,3-fucosylation at intact LacNAc sites. The general applicability and robustness of this strategy were demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of structurally well-defined fucosides of linear and branched &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked glycans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation has been developed. This protocol is characterized by its mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, thus unlocking a complementary technique to conventional C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions for accessing amine architectures from simple building blocks.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular amidation of saturated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is reported. This mild protocol exhibits a predictable reactivity pattern to incorporate amide functions at C(sp3)&#8722;H sites adjacent to nitrogen and oxygen atoms in either cyclic or acyclic frameworks, thus offering a complementary reactivity profile to existing oxidative&#8208;type processes or metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions operating via two&#8208;electron manifolds.

         <title>A Vitamin B2&#8208;Photocatalysed Approach to Methionine Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their emerging role in medicinal and biological chemistry, synthetic methods to access non&#8208;natural methionine analogues remain underdeveloped. Using vitamin B2&#8208;photocatalysis, simple sulfides undergo radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization with unsaturated amino acid partners to deliver an array of new methionine derivatives. The approach also facilitates the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains.







Abstract
Access to new non&#8208;canonical amino acid residues is crucial for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Analogues of the amino acid methionine have been far less explored&#8212;despite their use in biochemistry, pharmacology and peptide bioconjugation. This is largely due to limited synthetic access. Herein, we exploit a new disconnection to access non&#8208;natural methionines through the development of a photochemical method for the radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides with alkenes, in water, using inexpensive and commercially&#8208;available riboflavin (vitamin B2) as a photocatalyst. Our photochemical conditions allow the two&#8208;step synthesis of novel methionine analogues&#8212;by radical addition to unsaturated amino acid derivatives&#8212;and the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains to yield non&#8208;natural methionine residues within small peptides. The mechanism of the bio&#8208;inspired flavin photocatalysis has been probed by experimental, DFT and TDDFT studies.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] Alkaloids: A Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Spirocyclization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct spirocyclization approach was adopted for the concise chemical synthesis of a class of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids. Stereochemically complementary spirocyclic systems could be generated by manipulation of the spirocyclization pathway to favor the kinetic or thermodynamic product.







Abstract
A direct spirocyclization approach for the chemical synthesis of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids is reported. The absolute stereochemistry was introduced by a desymmetrizing Dieckmann condensation, and the relative stereochemistry was controlled by the manipulation of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways of the spirocyclization. By contrast to the biogenetic proposal involving the diester&#8208;type alkaloid as the precursor, we demonstrate that chemically a common lactone&#8208;type intermediate could bridge the chemical synthesis of this class of natural products.

         <title>Deciphering Ligand Controlled Structural Evolution of Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Electrochemical Activation during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution of the Prussian blue analogue precatalysts has been attained by replacing a &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acidic &#8722;NO. This in turn tunes the electronic and atomic structures and electrochemical properties of the active catalyst and a significant improvement in the alkaline water oxidation activity has been observed.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] with Co(OH)2@CC produced precatalysts PC&#8208;1 and PC&#8208;2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor &#8722;NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC&#8208;2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC&#8208;2 into active catalyst Fe&#8722;Co(OH)2&#8208;Co(O)OH (AC&#8208;2) has been attained only in 15&#8197;CV cycles while 600&#8197;CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC&#8208;1 into AC&#8208;1. The X&#8208;ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co&#8722;O and Fe&#8722;O bond in AC&#8208;2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC&#8208;1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC&#8208;2 and assists in the O&#8722;O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Labeling of Difluoromethyl and Trifluoromethyl Groups via Monoselective C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups using frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18. The method utilizes the target compound as the starting material simplifying the radiosynthetic protocol for labeling pharmaceuticals and radiotracers that already contain CF3 or CF2H groups.







Abstract
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups in a broad range of chemical settings (aryl, oxide, sulfide). The method utilizes frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18 in a two&#8208;step defluorination/radiofluorination process, and as such can utilize the target compounds as starting materials. The radiotracer precursors can be isolated as stable salts prior to radiofluorination. The method delivers good radiochemical yields and molar activities (up to 35.2&#177;6.5&#8201;% non&#8208;decay corrected isolated activity yields and 12.0&#177;1.7&#8197;GBq&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1 molar activities) and is shown to be applicable to biologically relevant compounds. The ability to utilize the target compound as the starting material and the synthetic simplicity of the method coupled with the ever&#8208;increasing use of CF3 and CF2H groups in pharmaceuticals makes this method attractive for drug and radiotracer development.

         <title>Progress in Hydrogen Production Coupled with Electrochemical Oxidation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions of small molecules are widely implemented to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve the highly efficient production of hydrogen. This Minireview systematically surveys the current progress in electro&#8208;oxidation reactions involving diverse molecules, different electrolytes, and novel mechanisms. The challenges and research directions of this area are highlighted.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to generate value&#8208;added products has gained enormous interest in recent years because of the advantages of benign operation conditions, high conversion efficiency and selectivity, the absence of external oxidizing agents, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Coupling the electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode in an electrolyzer would simultaneously realize the generation of high&#8208;value chemicals or pollutant degradation and the highly efficient production of hydrogen. This Minireview presents an introduction on small&#8208;molecule choice and design strategies of electrocatalysts as well as recent breakthroughs achieved in the highly efficient production of hydrogen. Finally, challenges and future orientations are highlighted.

         <title>Wide Band&#8208;Gap Polymer Donors Functionalized with Unconventional Carbamate Side Chains for Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique conformation lock is formed in a polymer donor using an unconventional carbamate side chain. It gives wide band&#8208;gap polymer donors for application in organic solar cells. Devices incorporating these donors yield power conversion efficiencies up to18.76&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering with heteroatoms is not only effective in tuning frontier molecular orbitals, but also possible for forming secondary bonds which can be utilized to planarize the molecular backbone, hence, improving the photon absorption as well as charge&#8208;transport abilities of polymer solar&#8208;cell (PSC) materials. Herein, two types of unconventional side chains, namely carboxylate and carbamate, containing various heteroatoms are introduced to the thiophene bridges in high performance benzodithiophene (BDT) based donor polymers to from the novel polymers PTzTz&#8208;C and PTzTz&#8208;N, respectively. In these polymers, non&#8208;covalent O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S and N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions induce a high tendency to aggregation. In a ternary&#8208;blend PSC with PTzTz&#8208;N added to the high&#8208;performance D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, complimentary absorption and improved thin&#8208;film morphology were observed with a top power conversion efficiency of 18.76&#8201;%, which is an improvement of almost 5&#8201;% over the D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 binary blends.

         <title>Accelerated and Concerted Aza&#8208;Michael Addition and SuFEx Reaction in Microdroplets in Unitary and High&#8208;Throughput Formats</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated, catalyst&#8208;free, coupled Aza&#8208;Michael addition and SuFEx reactions between amines and ethenesulfonyl fluoride under ambient conditions in microdroplets are analyzed by electrosonic spray mass spectrometry (ESSI&#8208;MS) while high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS) is used to follow reaction scope.







Abstract
The sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction is significant in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical biology. Conventionally, it involves installation of SO2F followed by fluoride exchange by a catalyst. We report catalyst&#8208;free Aza&#8208;Michael addition to install SO2F and then SuFEx reaction with amines, both occurring in concert, in microdroplets under ambient conditions. The microdroplet reaction is accelerated by a factor of &#8764;104 relative to the corresponding bulk reaction. We suggest that the superacidic microdroplet surface assists SuFEx reaction by protonating fluorine to create a good leaving group. The reaction scope was established by performing individual reactions in microdroplets of 18 amines in four solvents and confirmed using high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization experiments. The study demonstrates the value of microdroplet&#8208;assisted accelerated reactions in combination with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for characterization of reaction scope.

         <title>Evaluation of the Specific Activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs and the Intrinsic Activity of Tetrapyrrolic FeN4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein used the equivalence of an active site extraction to the poisoning of active sites to develop a new method for the determination of site density, utilization factor and TOF. The method is reminiscent of stripping techniques but since there are no probe molecules involved it can be applied to different classes of M&#8722;N&#8722;C directly at the relevant pH.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts are considered pivotal to replace expensive precious group metal&#8208;based materials in electrocatalytic conversions. However, their development is hampered by the limited availability of methods for the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of different active sites, like pyrrolic FeN4 sites within Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Currently, new synthetic procedures based on active&#8208;site imprinting followed by an ion exchange reaction, e.g. Zn&#8208;to&#8208;Fe, are producing single&#8208;site M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with outstanding activity. Based on the same replacement principle, we employed a conservative iron extraction to partially remove the Fe ions from the N4 cavities in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Having catalysts with the same morphological properties and Fe ligation that differ solely in Fe content allows for the facile determination of the decrease in density of active sites and their turn&#8208;over frequency. In this way, insight into the specific activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is obtained and for single&#8208;site catalysts the intrinsic activity of the site is accessible. This new approach surpasses limitations of methods that rely on probe molecules and, together with those techniques, offers a novel tool to unfold the complexity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs in general.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Redistribution between Hydrosilanes and Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed silane cross&#8208;redistribution reaction was developed for the synthesis of bis&#8208;silanes. The reaction is driven by enthalpy but not entropy, and the reaction is atom economical, without formation of gaseous silane side product. The reaction has broad substrate scope. This combined computational and experimental study shows that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Silanes are important in chemistry and material science. The self&#8208;redistribution of HSiCl3 is an industrial process to prepare SiH4, which is widely used in electronics and automobile industries. However, selective silane cross&#8208;redistribution to prepare advanced silanes is challenging. We now report an enthalpy&#8208;driven silane cross&#8208;redistribution to access bis&#8208;silanes that contain two different types of Si&#8722;H bonds in the same molecule. Compared with entropy&#8208;driven reactions, the enthalpy&#8208;driven reaction shows high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope (62 examples) and high atom economy. Our combined experimental and computational study indicates that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.

         <title>Native Top&#8208;Down Mass Spectrometry Reveals a Role for Interfacial Glycans on Therapeutic Cytokine and Hormone Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) reveals subunit composition and glycan heterogeneity of therapeutic glycoprotein assemblies. By comparing the measured oligomer proteoforms with theoretical models, reconstituted from the dissociated subunits, we show that the interfacial glycan influences complex stability.







Abstract
Oligomerization and glycosylation modulate therapeutic glycoprotein stability and efficacy. The interplay between these two critical attributes on therapeutic glycoproteins, is however often hard to define. Here, we present a native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) approach to assess the glycosylation status of therapeutic cytokine and hormone assemblies and relate interfacial glycan occupancy to complex stability. We found that interfacial O&#8208;glycan stabilizes tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; trimer. On the contrary, interferon&#8208;&#946;1a dimerization is independent of glycosylation. Moreover, we discovered a unique distribution of N&#8208;glycans on the follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone &#945; subunit. We found that the interfacial N&#8208;glycan, at Asn52 of the &#945; subunit, interacts extensively with the &#946; subunit to regulate the dimer assembly. Overall, we have exemplified a method to link glycosylation with assembly status, for cytokines and hormones, critical for informing optimal stability and bioavailability.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of &#948;&#8208;Valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone Caused by Uptake into Porous Pillar[5]arene Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immersion of porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature. This is due to catalytic activity of the phenols via the hydrogen bonds and capture of linear polyesters by pillar[5]arene crystals. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.







Abstract
Confined space provides a reaction platform with altered reaction rate and selectivity compared with a homogeneous solution. In this work, porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals were used as a reaction space to promote and perturb equilibrium between lactones and their corresponding polyesters. Immersion of porous pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature because the phenolic hydroxy groups have catalytic activity via hydrogen bonds and the pillar[5]arene cavities prefer linear guests. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.

         <title>Programmed Iteration Controls the Assembly of the Nonanoic Acid Side Chain of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic in which the polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified to a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain, which is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays were used to establish how 9HN is assembled through the action of multiple acyl carrier proteins, two ketosynthases and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;keto processing enzymes.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 that is assembled by a complex trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase. The polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified by a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain which is essential for biological activity. The ester side chain assembly is initialised from a 3&#8208;hydroxypropionate (3HP) starter unit attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) MacpD, but the fate of this species is unknown. Herein we report the application of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays to establish the remaining steps of 9HN biosynthesis. These investigations reveal a complex interplay between a novel iterative or &#8220;stuttering&#8221; KS&#8208;AT didomain (MmpF), the multidomain module MmpB and multiple ACPs. This work has important implications for understanding the late&#8208;stage biosynthetic steps of mupirocin and will be important for future engineering of related trans&#8208;AT biosynthetic pathways (e.g. thiomarinol).

         <title>Interfacial Designing of MnO2 Half&#8208;Wrapped by Aromatic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) is fabricated via two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the unique bonding interface of PODA/MnO2 and dual&#8208;energy storage mechanism of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion, C@PODA/MnO2 cathode exhibits high capacity, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability for aqueous Zn batteries.







Abstract
Due to the excellent specific capacity and high working voltage, manganese oxide (MnO2) has attracted considerable attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the irreversible structural collapse and sluggish ionic diffusion lead to poor rate capability and inferior lifespan. Herein, we proposed a novel organic/inorganic hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) for AZIBs. Various in/ex situ analyses and theoretical calculations prove that PODA chains with C=N groups can provide a more active surface/interface for ion/electron mobility and zinc ion storage in the hybrid cathode. More importantly, newly formed Mn&#8722;N interfacial bonds can effectively promote ion diffusion and prevent Mn atoms dissolution, enhancing redox kinetics and structural integrity of MnO2. Accordingly, C@PODA/MnO2 cathode exhibits high capacity (321&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 or 1.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), superior rate performance (88&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles. Hence, rational interfacial designs shed light on the development of organic/inorganic cathodes for advanced AZIBs.

         <title>o&#8208;Quinodimethane Atropisomers: Enantioselective Synthesis and Stereospecific Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes and their viability for highly stereoselective transformations are described. o&#8208;Quinodimethane precursors were readily accessible by an intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triyne substrates and the in situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers were converted in highly stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions at elevated temperature with up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.







Abstract
o&#8208;Quinodimethanes have remarkable utility as reactive intermediates in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, enabling significantly accelerated routes to complex polycyclic compounds. The discovery of different discrete precursors to thermally generate o&#8208;quinodimethanes thereby greatly augmented their availability and versatility. However, due to the required high temperatures and the immense reactivity of o&#8208;quinodimethanes, stereoselectivity to afford isomerically defined products still constitutes a critical challenge. Herein, we describe the accessibility of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes, the enantioselective synthesis of their precursors, their remarkable configurational stability and the stereospecific transformation by the benzannulation of dienophiles. A catalyst&#8208;stereocontrolled [2+2+2] cycloaddition, the generation of o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers and ensuing stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions enabled enantioselectivities through these transient intermediates with of up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylative Cyclization of Alkenes with Alkyl Bromides via Radical Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described a new copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with unactivated alkyl bromides. In this reaction, two carbonyl groups were introduced into the double bond by the insertion of two molecules of carbon monoxide, and four new C&#8722;C bonds could be constructed in one reaction. At the same time, the corresponding skeletons of &#945;&#8208;tetralones as well as 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;one were obtained smoothly, which could also be transformed into three consecutive ring structures via subsequent derivatizations.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a new procedure on 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with alkyl bromides. Using simple copper catalyst, two molecules of carbon monoxide were introduced into the double bond with the formation of four new C&#8722;C bonds and a new ring. Various &#945;&#8208;tetralones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones were formed in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Halosulfonylation of Strain&#8208;Release Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of strained hydrocarbons is described that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. Sulfonyl halides featuring aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents are generated in situ from sulfinate salts and convenient halogen atom sources. This chemistry enables the synthesis of an array of halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale. Hal=Halogen.







Abstract
Sulfonylated aromatics are commonplace motifs in drugs and agrochemicals. However, methods for the direct synthesis of sulfonylated non&#8208;classical arene bioisosteres, which could improve the physicochemical properties of drug and agrochemical candidates, are limited. Here we report a solution to this challenge: a one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of [1.1.1]propellane, [3.1.1]propellane and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. The sulfonyl halides used in this chemistry feature aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents, and are conveniently generated in situ from readily available sulfinate salts and halogen atom sources. This methodology enables the synthesis of an array of pharmaceutically and agrochemically relevant halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale.

         <title>Light, Heat and Electricity Integrated Energy Conversion System: Photothermal&#8208;Assisted Co&#8208;Electrolysis of CO2 and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect to accelerate faster charge&#8208;transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products.







Abstract
Strategy that can design powerful photothermal&#8208;catalysts to achieve photothermal&#8208;effect assisted coupling&#8208;catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO2 electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. Specifically, the FECO (cathode) and FEHCOOH (anode) for Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF can reach up to &#8776;100&#8201;% at 1.9&#8197;V with &#8776;31.5&#8201;% saved overall electricity&#8208;consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect (&#916;T=49.1&#8201;&#176;C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.

         <title>Intrinsic Phase Stability and Inherent Bandgap of Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) solvents inside the void of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystal promote the phase transtion at kitenics (2). By adopting the 2&#8208;methoxyethanol (2&#8208;ME) as solvent, highly stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be accquried due to slow solid to solid phase transition (1). The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with crystal size above 100&#8197;&#956;m owns inherent 1.41&#8197;eV band gap.







Abstract
Understanding the intrinsic phase stability and inherent band gap of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is crucial to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we explored the &#945;&#8208; to &#948;&#8208;phase transition and band gap of FAPbI3 single crystals grown by an inverse temperature solubility method. We found that the residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone solvents in the inner empty space of the FAPbI3 single crystal accelerate the phase transition at kinetics. By adopting 2&#8208;methoxyethanol as the solvent, over 2000&#8197;h of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired. This proves that although FAPbI3 is regarded as unstable at thermodynamics, it could own excellent kinetic stability without any doping or additives because of the slow solid to solid phase transition instead of the fast phase transition assisted by the solvents. Furthermore, we revealed that the bulk FAPbI3 single crystal with a size above 100&#8197;&#956;m can have an inherent band gap of 1.41&#8197;eV. Thus, our work provides key scientific guidance for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Spatially Directed Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots via Spidroin Templating in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein is a novel strategy for spatially confined biosynthesis of quantum dots in bacterium by using biomolecular condensates formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of recombinant spider silk protein. This provides a previously unprecedented access to compartmentalized nanostructure synthesis within living cells with great potential for in situ applications.







Abstract
Spatially directed synthesis of quantum dots (QDs) is intriguing yet challenging in organisms, due to the dispersed feature of templating biomolecules and precursors. Whether this task could be accomplished by biomolecular condensates, an emerging type of membraneless compartments in cells remains unknown. Here we report synthetic protein condensates for templated synthesis of QDs in bacterium Escherichia coli. This was realized by overexpression of spider silk protein to bind precursor ions and recruit other necessary components, which induced the spidroin to form more &#946;&#8208;sheet structures for assembly and maturation of the protein condensates. This in turn enabled formation and co&#8208;localization of the fluorescent QDs to &#8220;light up&#8221; the condensates, and alleviated cytotoxicity of the precursor heavy metal ions and resulting QDs. Thus, our results suggest a new strategy for nanostructure synthesis and deposition in subcellular compartments with great potential for in situ applications.

         <title>Photoexcited Enzymes for Asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis offers exciting opportunities to induce new reactivities and to create novel enzymes for reactions other than their native ones. Recently, Hyster and co&#8208;workers demonstrated this for a photoenzymatic asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, a reactivity previously unknown to enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes have several advantages over conventional catalysts for organic synthesis. Over the last two decades, much effort has been made to further extend the scope of biocatalytic reactions available to synthetic chemists, particularly by expanding the repertoire of enzymes for abiological transformations. In this regard, exciting new developments in the area of photobiocatalysis enable now the introduction of non&#8208;natural reactivity in enzymes to solve long&#8208;standing synthetic challenges. A recently described example from the Hyster group demonstrates in an unprecedented way how the combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis empowers the catalytic asymmetric construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds with high chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>A Sensitive and Nonoptical CRISPR Detection Mechanism by Sizing Double&#8208;Stranded &#955; DNA Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA sizing&#8208;based biosensor utilizing the trans cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a against &#955; DNA is reported. The concept of target concentration dependent size reduction of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of double&#8208;stranded DNA as nonoptical CRISPR reporters for developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care and easy&#8208;to&#8208;read nucleic acid detection biosensors.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors often rely on colorimetric, fluorescent, or electrochemical signaling mechanism, which involves expensive reporters and/or sophisticated equipment. Here, we demonstrated a simple, inexpensive, nonoptical, and sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based sensing platform to detect ssDNA targets by sizing double&#8208;stranded &#955; DNA as novel report molecules. In this platform, the size reduction of &#955; DNA was quantified by gel electrophoresis analysis. We hypothesize that the massive trans&#8208;nuclease activity of Cas12a toward &#955; DNA is due to the presence of single&#8208;stranded looped structures along the &#955; DNA sequence. In addition, we observed a strong binding affinity between Cas12a and &#955; DNA, which further promotes the trans&#8208;cleavage activity and helps achieve sub&#8208;picomolar detection sensitivity, &#8776;100&#8197;times more sensitive than the fluorescent counterpart. The concept of utilizing the physical size change of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of dsDNA as CRISPR reporters.

         <title>Low&#8208;Toxicity ZnSe/ZnS Quantum Dots as Potent Photoreductants and Triplet Sensitizers for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots, surface&#8208;functionalized with electron or triplet&#8208;energy relay molecules, function as potent photosensitizers to address challenging organic transformations.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can photocatalyze diverse organic reactions. However, reported QD&#8208;photocatalysts often contain highly&#8208;toxic elements Cd or Pb, and have not surpassed prototypical transition&#8208;metal complexes in terms of their photoredox power or excited&#8208;state energy. Here we report low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs as potent visible photocatalysts to drive challenging organic transformations. To overcome the limitation of short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the QDs, we functionalize their surfaces with benzophenone ligands which can rapidly extract electrons from photoexcited QDs and sustain long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. The benzophenone anions function as potent electron relay to drive dehalogenation of aryl chlorides and additive&#8208;free polymerization of acrylates. Alternatively, the QDs are functionalized with biphenyl ligands to store energy in long&#8208;lived, energetic triplets, enabling [2+2] homo&#8208;cycloaddition of styrene and cycloaddition of carbonyls with alkenes.

         <title>Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular bioorthogonal metabolic shunt has been shown to successfully link reduced oxygen concentration to singlet oxygen generation with an intermediate fluoride releasing step. As reported by Lei Wang, Engin&#8197;U. Akkaya et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210249), this approach not only broadens the spectrum of intracellular bioorthogonal reactions, but at the same time highlights a new pathway to follow towards smart and selective therapeutic agents, with precise spatio&#8208;temporal targeting of singlet oxygen.

         <dc:description>
The arginine degradation pathway of pathogenically crucial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) heme enzyme has been efficiently modeled utilizing synthetic analogs of corresponding reaction components. This model reaction between oxime substrates and heme peroxo intermediates essentially reflects the second mechanistic step of NOS. As reported by Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211521), in&#8208;depth thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic interrogations unveil key attributes that closely parallel the enzymatic system, shedding light on some impactful unknowns.

Like a bow, PoFUT2 arms a peptide (arrow) and launches it once glycosylated with the help of a water environment. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213610) Ram&#243;n Hurtado&#8208;Guerrero, Pedro Merino et&#8197;al. show, using QM/MM methods, how the enzyme takes advantage of a high exposure of the active site, allowing water molecules to facilitate a pure SN2 mechanism. The synergistic effect of an arginine residue and water molecules facilitates a smooth leaving of the pyrophosphate group.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction through Spontaneous Charge Separation in End&#8208;Capping Assembly of Heterostructured Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient end&#8208;capping strategy is developed to construct intramolecular heterostructures by incorporating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to the photoinduced spontaneous charge separation between COFs and PAHs, the heterostructured COFs exhibit outstanding activity and selectivity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
It is well known that charge separation is crucial for efficient photocatalytic solar conversion. Although some covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit visible&#8208;light harvest, the large exciton binding energies reduce their photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we developed a novel method to post&#8208;treat the olefin&#8208;linked COFs with end&#8208;capping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for spontaneous charge separation. Interestingly, a type&#8208;II heterostructure is constructed in our perylene&#8208;modified COFs which displays drastically enhanced performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with an efficiency of 8&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified COF. A combination of electrochemical, steady&#8208;state, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicates that such drastically enhanced performance should be attributed to photoinduced spontaneous charge separation in the heterostructure. These results illustrate the feasibility of engineering the charge&#8208;separation properties of crystalline porous frameworks at a molecular level for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Construction of Catalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Redox&#8208;Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with bifunctional roles in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been prepared by integrating redox&#8208;active sites into the cobalt&#8208;porphyrin frameworks. The COFs have high electrochemical surface areas and electron transfer abilities, and have good catalytic activities in oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Construction of catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. In this work, we have first constructed bifunctional COFs towards ORR and OER by integrating diarylamine derivatives into the Co&#8208;porphyrin based frameworks. Both of the new COFs (CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF and CoTAPP&#8208;BDTA&#8208;COF) have good ordered structures, high surface areas, and robust chemical stability. The diarylamine units, as a typical electron donor and redox&#8208;active cores, promote intramolecular electron transport along the frameworks and improve the electrochemically active surface areas. Thus, the COFs showed higher catalytic activities than that of the COF without redox&#8208;active units. CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF had a halfwave potential of 0.80&#8197;V towards ORR, and delieved an overpotential of 420&#8197;mV for OER in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. The theoretical calculation revealed introducing diarylamine unites improved the oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Chemicals from Contaminated Water Sources Using Magnetic Fluorinated Polymer Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic polymer sorbents (polymer@IONPs) were prepared for rapid, selective and efficient removal of multiple per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from real contaminated waters at environmentally relevant concentrations. Fast magnetic recovery of the sorbent within 30&#8197;s was achieved. Regeneration of the sorbent for repeated use was demonstrated over four cycles. The technology is promising for large&#8208;scale implementation of PFAS capture.







Abstract
Efficient removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated waters is urgently needed to safeguard public and environmental health. In this work, novel magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbents were designed to allow efficient capture of PFAS and fast magnetic recovery of the sorbed material. The new sorbent has superior PFAS removal efficiency compared with the commercially available activated carbon and ion&#8208;exchange resins. The removal of the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches &gt;99&#8201;% within 30&#8197;s, and the estimated sorption capacity was 219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the Langmuir model. Robust and efficient regeneration of the magnetic polymer sorbent was confirmed by the repeated sorption and desorption of GenX over four cycles. The sorption of multiple PFAS in two real contaminated water matrices at an environmentally relevant concentration (1&#8197;ppb) shows &gt;95&#8201;% removal for the majority of PFAS tested in this study.

Abstract
It remains challenging to control the single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence of metal nanoclusters. In this work, the control over the non&#8208;linear optics of metal nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished via exploiting the solvent effect. An emissive nanocluster, Au9Ag6(SPhtOMe)4(DPPOE)3Cl3, was synthesized and structurally determined. The solvent effect can not only control the fluorescence of this nanocluster, but more significantly, it can also regulate the photoluminescence nature of the cluster as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. We concluded that the increased solution polarity, improved dipole moment, enlarged HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, and reduced solution viscosity of the cluster in solutions endow them with excellent high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence. The results provide an intriguing cluster template that enables us to manipulate the linear and nonlinear optics at the atomic level.

         <title>Discerning the Contributions of Gold Species in Butadiene Hydrogenation: From Single Atoms to Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to unveil the activity contributions of distinct gold species in butadiene hydrogenation. The strategy combines nanostructuring of single&#8208;atom gold catalysts, electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based automatic image analyses of the full metal ensembles, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies.







Abstract
Identification of the roles of different active sites is vital for the rational design of catalysts. We present a cutting&#8208;edge strategy to discern the contributions of different single&#8208;atom gold species and nanoparticles in 1,3&#8208;butadiene hydrogenation, through coupling of advanced spectroscopic techniques, electron microscopy&#8208;based automated image analyses, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies. While all the carbon&#8208;hosted single gold atoms display negligible initial activity, the in situ&#8208;evolved gold nanoparticles are highly active. Full metal&#8208;species quantification is realized by combining electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based atom recognition statistics and deep&#8208;learning&#8208;driven nanoparticle segmentation algorithm, allowing the structure&#8211;activity correlations for the hybrid catalysts containing different Au architectures to be established. Surface exposure density of Au nanoparticles, as revealed by electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based statistics, is revealed as a new and reliable activity descriptor.

         <title>Isotropic Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity Cooperated with Installed Imidazolium Molecular Motions in a 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Phosphate Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystalline 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 salt of imidazole and phosphoric acid exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is observed for the first time in organic molecular crystals. Significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations was revealed to accelerate proton conduction via the 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded phosphate network by the depolarization effect.







Abstract
Utilizing molecular motion is essential for the use of anhydrous superprotonic molecular proton conductors (&#963; beyond 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) as electrolytes in hydrogen fuel cells. However, molecular motion contributing to the improvement of intrinsic proton conduction has been limited and little clarified in relation to the proton conduction mechanism, limiting the development of material design guidelines. Here, a salt with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) phosphate network with imidazolium cations installed inside was studied, whose components are known to exhibit molecular motions that contribute to proton conduction. Despite its anisotropic H&#8208;bonded network, the salt exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8776;351&#8197;K, which is the first example for organic molecular crystal. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural analysis and solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR measurements revealed significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations, which accelerate proton conduction via the 3D H&#8208;bonded phosphate network.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Facilitated Detection and Sequencing of 5&#8208;Formylcytidine RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem Wittig&#8208;cyclization reaction was initiated with the use of triphenyl phosphonium ylide under light irradiation for the chemical labelling of 5&#8208;formylcytidine f5C RNA, making it possible to detect trace amount of f5C in cell lysates and to develop a new sequencing strategy named paC&#8208;Seq for cytosine in a single&#8208;base resolution.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formylcytidine (f5C) is one of the epigenetic nucleotides in tRNA. Despite the evident importance of f5C in gene expression regulation, little is known about its exact amount and position. To capture this information, we developed a modification&#8208;specific functionalization with a semi&#8208;stabilized ylide. The chemical labelling exhibited a high selectivity towards f5C and allowed distinction from similar 5&#8208;formyluridine. We realized a detection strategy based on the fluorescence signal of the cyclization product 4,5&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine&#8208;cytidine paC, which exhibited a high quantum yield. The results clearly identified f5C with a limit of detection at 0.58&#8197;nM. This method altered the hydrogen bonding activities of f5C and modulated its reverse transcription signature in its sequencing profile. We showed that f5C can be detected from tRNA segments with a single&#8208;base resolution. Taken together, this approach is a sensitive, antibody&#8208;free, and applicable detection and sequencing method for f5C&#8208;containing RNA.

         <title>A Photoinduced, Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction for the Stereoselective Assembly of C&#8208;Linked Glycosides and Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  &#8208;Alkyl glycosides and glycoproteins exist in natural products, and are prized for their role as carbohydrate mimics in drug design. However, a practical strategy that merges glycosyl donors with readily accessible reagents, derived from abundant carboxylic acid and amine feedstocks, is yet to be conceived. Here, we show that a nickel catalyst promotes C&#8208;C coupling between glycosyl halides and aliphatic acids or primary amines (converted to redox&#8208;active electrophiles in one step), in the presence of Hantzsch ester and LiI (or Et  3  N) under blue LED illumination to deliver  C  &#8208;alkyl glycosides in high diastereoselectivities. Mechanistic studies support the photoinduced formation of alkyl radicals that react with an  in situ  &#8208;generated glycosyl&#8208;nickel species to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling. Through this manifold, innate CO  2  H and NH  2  motifs embedded within amino acids and oligopeptides are selectively capped and functionalized to afford glycopeptide conjugates via late&#8208;stage glycosylation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Essential Role of Water Molecules in the Reaction Mechanism of Protein O&#8208;Fucosyltransferase 2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PoFUT2 is an inverting glycosyltransferase that fucosylates TSR repeats of group 1 and 2. By applying computational methodologies, it has been found that PoFUT2 follows a pure SN2 mechanism in which water molecules play an essential role in the catalysis. Recognition of the TSR repeats by direct and water&#8208;mediated interactions, together with the role of water molecules around the catalytic center, constitute the driving force of the process.







Abstract
Protein O&#8208;fucosyltransferase 2 (PoFUT2) is an inverting glycosyltransferase (GT) that fucosylates thrombospondin repeats (TSRs) from group 1 and 2. PoFUT2 recognizes a large and diverse number of TSRs through a dynamic network of water&#8208;mediated interactions. By X&#8208;ray structural studies of C. elegans PoFUT2 complexed to a TSR of group 2, we demonstrate that this GT recognizes similarly the 3D structure of TSRs from both groups 1 and 2. Its active site is highly exposed to the solvent, suggesting that water molecules might also play an essential role in the fucosylation mechanism. We applied QM/MM methods using human PoFUT2 as a model, and found that HsPoFUT2 follows a classical SN2 reaction mechanism in which water molecules contribute to a great extent in facilitating the release of the leaving pyrophosphate unit, causing the H transfer from the acceptor nucleophile (Thr/Ser) to the catalytic base, which is the last event in the reaction. This demonstrates the importance of water molecules not only in recognition of the ligands but also in catalysis.

         <title>The Role of Discrepant Reactive Intermediates on Ru&#8208;Ru2P Heterostructure for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media is essential for the commercialization of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC). However, the kinetics of HOR in alkaline media is complicated, resulting in orders of magnitude slower than that in acid, even for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. Here,&#160;we find that Ru&#8208;Ru2P/C&#160;heterostructure shows HOR performance with a non&#8208;monotonous variation in a whole pH region. Unexpectedly, an inflection point located at pH~7 is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that&#160;HOR activity under alkaline media surpasses acidic media. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations,&#160;we&#160;propose the roles of discrepant reactive intermediates for pH&#8208;universal HOR, while H* and H2O* adsorption strengths are&#160;responsible for acidic HOR, and OH* adsorption strength is essential for alkaline HOR. This work not only sheds light on fundamentally understanding the mechanism of HOR but also provides new designing principles for pH&#8208;targeted electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

Here,&#160;we find that Ru-Ru2P/C&#160;heterostructure shows HOR performance with a non-monotonous variation in a whole pH region. Unexpectedly, an inflection point located at pH~7 is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that&#160;HOR activity under alkaline media surpasses acidic media. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations,&#160;we&#160;propose the roles of discrepant reactive intermediates for pH-universal HOR, while H* and H2O* adsorption strengths are&#160;responsible for acidic HOR, and OH* adsorption strength is essential for alkaline HOR. This work not only sheds light on fundamentally understanding the mechanism of HOR but also provides new designing principles for pH-targeted electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Negligible ion migration in Tin&#8208;based and Tin&#8208;doped perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion migration is a notorious phenomena observed in ionic perovskite materials. It causes several severe issues in perovskite optoelectronic devices such as instability, current hysteresis, and phase segregation. Here, we report that, in contrast to lead halide perovskites (LHPs), no ion migration or phase segregation was observed in tin halide perovskites (THPs) under illumination or an electric field. The origin is attributed to a much stronger Sn&#8208;halide bond and higher ion migration activation energy (Ea) in THPs, which remain nearly constant under illumination. We further figured out the threshold Ea for the absence of ion migration to be around 0.65 eV using the CsSnyPb1&#8208;y(I0.6Br0.4)3&#160;system whose Ea varies with Sn ratios. Our work shows that ion migration does not necessarily exist in all perovskites and suggests metallic doping to be a promising way of stopping ion migration and improving the intrinsic stability of perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Inspired Polymers with Metal&#8208;Site&#8208;Regulated Ordered Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal ions play critical roles in facilitating peptide folding and inducing conformational transitions, thereby impacting on the biological activity of many proteins. However, the effect of metal sites on the hierarchical structures of biopolymers is still poorly understood. Herein, inspired by metalloproteins, we report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in synthetic polymers mediated by a variety of metal ions. The copolymers are decorated with clinically available desferrioxamine (DFO) as an exogenous ligand template, which presents a geometric constraint toward peptide backbone via short&#8208;range hydrogen bonding interactions, thus dramatically altering the secondary conformations and self&#8208;assembly behaviors of polypeptides and allowing for a controllable &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition modulated by metal&#8208;ligand interactions. These metallopolymers could form ferritin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structures with high stability and membrane activity for efficient brain delivery across the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Communication and Cross&#8208;Regulation between Chemically Fueled Sender and Receiver Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature connects multiple fuel&#8208;driven chemical/enzymatic reaction networks (CRNs/ERNs) via cross&#8208;regulation to hierarchically control biofunctions for a tailored adaption in complex sensory landscapes. Herein, we introduce a facile example of communication and cross&#8208;regulation among two fuel&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based ERNs regulated by a concatenated RNA transcription regulator. ERN1 (&#8220;sender&#8221;) is designed for the fuel&#8208;driven promoter formation for T7 RNA polymerase, which activates RNA transcription. The produced RNA can deactivate or activate DNA in ERN2 (&#8220;receiver&#8221;) by toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, leading to a communication between two ERNs. The RNA from ERN1 can repress or promote the fuel&#8208;driven state of ERN2; ERN2 in turn feedbacks to regulate the lifetime of ERN1. Furthermore, the incorporation of RNase H allows for RNA degradation and enables the autonomous recovery of ERN2. We believe that concatenation of multiple CRNs/ERNs provides a basis for the design of more elaborate autonomous regulatory mechanisms in systems chemistry and synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>An antitumor dual&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest supramolecular polymer based on hypoxia&#8208;cleavable azocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of specific guests which can respond to external stimuli is the main approach for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) based on host&#8208;guest interactions. Most functional guests, however, fail to manifest stimuli&#8208;responses. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;responsive dimeric azocalixarene (D&#8208;SAC4A) with outstanding hosting properties was used as the macrocyclic building block for the preparation of host stimuli&#8208;responsive SPs. Since azocalixarenes can also be compatible with stimuli&#8208;responsive guests, an antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), was chosen and linked via a disulfide&#8208;containing linker to afford a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive ditropic guest (D&#8208;CPT). A unique dual&#8208;responsive SP was obtained by 1:1 mixing of D&#8208;SAC4A and D&#8208;CPT in water, which further assembled into SP nanoparticles (DSPNs). DSPNs displayed outstanding stability against dilution and biological interferants, as well as precise CPT&#8208;release under GSH and hypoxia conditions. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the good biosafety and tumor&#8208;suppressive effects of DSPNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Integration of Organic Core/Shell Microwires for Advanced Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation reaction leaves room to be improved in the development of various solar fuel productions in an aqueous solution, because of not only the kinetically sluggish 4&#8208;electron transfer process of oxygen evolution reaction but also the formation of unadded value product, O  2  . In this work, we realize reactive oxygen species (ROS), H  2  O  2  and OH&#8226;, formations by water oxidation with total Faraday efficiencies of more than 90% by using (200)/(002) inter&#8208;facet edge (IFE) rich WO  3  arrays in an electrolyte containing CO  3  2&#8208;  . Theoretical simulation and in&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the IFE favors the adsorption of CO  3  2&#8208;  while reducing the adsorption energy of OH&#8226;, as well as suppresses surface hole accumulation to enable a synergetic direct and indirect charge transfer pathways of 1&#8208;electron and 2&#8208;electron transfer processes. Finally, we present selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in in&#8208;situ using the formed OH&#8226;, which delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of ~768 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  with near 100% selectivity that exceeds the most reported value. This work offers a promising approach to tune or control the oxidation reaction in an aqueous solar fuel system towards high efficiency and value&#8208;added product  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Sensitive and Reversible Labeling Strategy Enables Global Mapping of the Core&#8208;Fucosylated Glycoproteome on Cell Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that locate on cell surfaces can be selectively probed by a reversible labeling strategy, enabling the global mapping of the core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome.







Abstract
Core fucosylation, the attachment of &#945;1,6&#8208;fucose to the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of N&#8208;glycans, has a strong relationship with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, prognosis, and immune evasion by regulating many membrane proteins. However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell&#8208;surface core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell&#8208;surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.

         <title>Combination Cancer Treatment: Using Engineered DNAzyme Molecular Machines for Dynamic Inter&#8208; and Intracellular Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines was designed for promoting cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. Our strategy resulted in an enhanced killing effect, demonstrated using zinc deficient cancer cells, thus providing a promising next&#8208;generation combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
Despite the promise of combination cancer therapy, it remains challenging to develop targeted strategies that are nontoxic to normal cells. Here we report a combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines that can promote cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. To achieve external regulation of T&#8208;cell/cancer cell interactions, we designed a DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with an aptamer and an i&#8208;motif, as the MUC&#8208;1&#8208;selective aptamer allows the specific recognition of cancer cells. The i&#8208;motif is folded under the tumor acidic microenvironment, shortening the intercellular distance. As a result, T&#8208;cells are released by metal ion activated DNAzyme cleavage. To achieve internal regulation of mitochondria, we delivered another DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with mitochondria&#8208;targeted peptides into cancer cells to induce mitochondria aggregation. Our strategy achieved an enhanced killing effect in zinc deficient cancer cells.

         <title>Deracemization through Sequential Photoredox&#8208;Neutral and Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stoichiometric reagent&#8208;free deracemization strategy based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis is developed. The strategy offers precise access to biologically important &#945;&#8208;amino esters and variants with high yields and ee values. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by enantiocontrol of the protonation as the stereocentre&#8208;forming step. The method is also viable for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;&#8208;amino esters.







Abstract
Catalytic deracemization is an ideal synthetic strategy due to its formally perfect atom utilization. Asymmetric photocatalysis has been appreciated as a promising tool to accomplish this attractive reaction pattern in an economical fashion, but it remains underdeveloped. Here, we report a new platform based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis, allowing efficient and modular optical enrichment of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and other valuable analogues. Two single&#8208;electron transfer processes between the photocatalyst and the substrates serve to provide the key prochiral intermediates, and the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst mediates enantioselective protonation to reconstitute a stereogenic C&#8722;H bond. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by the enantiofacial differentiation effect during the stereocentre&#8208;forming step.

         <title>A Triplet Label Extends Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy from Pico&#8208; to Microseconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short vibrational lifetimes limit monitoring molecular dynamics by conventional IR spectroscopy to &#8776;15&#8197;ps. We extend this window &#8776;50&#8201;000 fold by introducing the novel Fourier&#8208;transform VIPER pulse sequence with the triplet label 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone. Slow processes up to 1&#8197;&#956;s (e.g., in glassy matrices, liquid crystals, or solvent dynamics) are now accessible.







Abstract
In conventional two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, the inherently short vibrational lifetimes limit the time window to observe molecular dynamics typically to tens of picoseconds. The rather complex dynamics of organized molecular systems (e.g., glass formers, polymers, membranes, proteins), however, span a wide range of timescales from femto&#8208; to microseconds and beyond. Vibrationally Promoted Electronic Resonance (VIPER) 2D&#8208;IR negates the limitations of 2D&#8208;IR spectroscopy, for its signal decays with the electronic lifetime. Here, we present 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone as the first VIPER 2D&#8208;IR probe to exploit intersystem crossing, thereby covering even the microsecond timescale. We achieved the required signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and resolution by introducing the Fourier&#8208;transform approach to the VIPER 2D&#8208;IR pulse sequence. Now, we are in a position to monitor dynamics via spectral diffusion several orders of magnitude beyond the vibrational lifetime of 2D&#8208;IR labels.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Simple Ketones Enabled by Activation of Unstrained C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed directing group&#8208;free formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction was established between simple ketones and arylboronates based on activation of unstrained C&#8722;C bonds. The key to the success of this reaction is a nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.







Abstract
The use of ketones as electrophiles to couple with arylboronic acid derivatives via C&#8722;C bond activation has become a significant progress in the area of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction, in which a permanent or temporary directing group is often required to promote the activation of the unstrained C&#8722;C bond via oxidative addition. Herein, we disclosed the first example of directing group free formal SMC reaction of simple ketones with arylboronates via Rh&#8208;catalyzed unstrained C&#8722;C bond activation. A wide range of simple ketones, including aryl alkyl ketones, diaryl ketones and aryl perfluoroalkyl ketones, can serve as electrophiles to participate in the SMC reaction with aryl or perfluoroalkyl as the leaving group. The key to the success of this reaction is by means of nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Modulated Nucleofugality of SeIII Species to Enable Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Semipinacol Manifolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox catalytic 1,2&#8208;carbon&#8208;shift manifold is enabled by an unprecedented OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;SeIII hydrogen bond co&#8208;activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds. While traditional oxidative methods for the activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds proceed through SeIV intermediates and commonly result in rapid elimination of the SeIV residue, this protocol facilitates, for the first time, the stereospecific substitution of SeIII nucleofuges by carbon nucleophiles.







Abstract
Chemical bond activations mediated by H&#8208;bond interactions involving highly electronegative elements such as nitrogen and oxygen are powerful tactics in modern catalysis research. On the contrary, kindred catalytic regimes in which heavier, less electronegative elements such as selenium engage in H&#8208;bond interactions to co&#8208;activate C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds under oxidative conditions are elusive. Traditional strategies to enhance the nucleofugality of selenium residues predicate on the oxidative addition of electrophiles onto SeII&#8208;centers, which entails the elimination of the resulting SeIV moieties. Catalytic procedures in which SeIV nucleofuges are substituted rather than eliminated are very rare and, so far, not applicable to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations. In this study, we introduce an unprecedented combination of O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se H&#8208;bond interactions and single electron oxidation to catalytically generate SeIII nucleofuges that allow for the formation of new C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds by means of a type I semipinacol process in high yields and excellent selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;A photoredox catalytic 1,2-carbon-shift manifold is enabled by an unprecedented OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen bond co-activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;-bonds. While traditional oxidative methods for the activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;-bonds proceed through Se&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; intermediates and commonly result in rapid elimination of the Se&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; residue, this protocol facilitates, for the first time, the stereospecific substitution of Se&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; nucleofuges by carbon nucleophiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical bond activations mediated by H-bond interactions involving highly electronegative elements such as nitrogen and oxygen are powerful tactics in modern catalysis research. On the contrary, kindred catalytic regimes in which heavier, less electronegative elements such as selenium engage in H-bond interactions to co-activate C&#8722;Se &#963;-bonds under oxidative conditions are elusive. Traditional strategies to enhance the nucleofugality of selenium residues predicate on the oxidative addition of electrophiles onto Se&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-centers, which entails the elimination of the resulting Se&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; moieties. Catalytic procedures in which Se&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; nucleofuges are substituted rather than eliminated are very rare and, so far, not applicable to carbon-carbon bond formations. In this study, we introduce an unprecedented combination of O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se H-bond interactions and single electron oxidation to catalytically generate Se&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; nucleofuges that allow for the formation of new C&#8722;C &#963;-bonds by means of a type I semipinacol process in high yields and excellent selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycan Modulation of Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor&#8208;1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work provides a new insight into insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R), which is preferentially inhibited by smaller heparan sulfate chains, e.g., HS06, in contrast to longer polysaccharidic chains, e.g., HS36, which are devoid of the inhibition function.







Abstract
The insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays critical roles in cancer. Microarray, computational, thermodynamic, and cellular imaging studies reveal that activation of IGF&#8208;1R by its cognate ligand IGF1 is inhibited by shorter, soluble heparan sulfate (HS) sequences (e.g., HS06), whereas longer polymeric chains do not inhibit the RTK, a phenomenon directly opposed to the traditional relationship known for GAG&#8208;protein systems. The inhibition arises from smaller oligosaccharides binding in a unique pocket in the IGF&#8208;1R ectodomain, which competes with the natural cognate ligand IGF1. This work presents a highly interesting observation on preferential and competing inhibition of IGF&#8208;1R by smaller sequences, whereas polysaccharides are devoid of this function. These insights will be of major value to glycobiologists and anti&#8208;cancer drug discoverers.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylated Quinoids by Organocatalytic Tandem N&#8208;Arylation/Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed process was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;aryl quinoid atropisomers through direct C&#8722;N bond formation. In this way, a broad range of functionalized N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers containing an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring were constructed in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Diarylamines and related scaffolds are ubiquitous atropisomeric chemotypes in biologically active natural products. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these axially chiral compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report that a BINOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) successfully catalyzed the atroposelective coupling of quinone esters and anilines through direct C&#8722;N bond formation to afford N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers with an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring in good yields and enantioselectivities with the quinone ester as both the electrophile and the oxidant. A gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the utility of this synthetic protocol. Moreover, this methodology provides a platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse secondary amine atropisomers by nucleophilic addition.

         <title>Microhydrated 3&#8208;Methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol: Evolution of the Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network from Chains to Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas&#8208;phase MOM&#8208;(H2O)n (n=0&#8211;6) clusters are studied using rotational spectroscopy. The growth of the H&#8208;bonding networks in these complexes exhibits characteristic transitions from one&#8208;dimensional chains, to two&#8208;dimensional rings, and further to three&#8208;dimensional arrangements that leads to a &#8220;cube&#8221;&#8208;like network resembling the pure water octamer.







Abstract
Broadband rotational spectroscopy is used to investigate the geometries of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol and its complexes with up to six water molecules, which are produced in supersonic jets. The main low&#8208;energy isomers of these clusters are unambiguously identified in the spectra with the support of quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The conformation of the 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol geometry is found to be influenced by the microsolvation effects. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrangements in the hydrate complexes, which are governed by the water&#8208;water and water&#8208;solute interactions, exhibit characteristic configurations with increasing number of water molecules and resemble the main isomers of the corresponding pure water clusters. Evolution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding structures from one&#8208;dimensional chains to two&#8208;dimensional rings and further to multicyclic three&#8208;dimensional networks is observed, which provides information about the build&#8208;up process.

         <title>General Access to N&#8722;CF3 Secondary Amines and Their Transformation to N&#8722;CF3 Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and mild method for the generation of HF from triethylsilane and silver fluoride leads to a highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines. Novel N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides were constructed from these promising amine building blocks and sulfonyl bromides in an unprecedented route.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds through fluorination or trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;containing compounds has been extensively investigated. However, general access to N&#8722;CF3 compounds simply from N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines is hampered by the challenging preparation and instability of these amines, as well as a much lower reactivity due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl moiety. Herein, we report a general and highly efficient synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines with excellent isolated yields via the addition of the in situ generated difluoromethyl imine (R&#8722;N=CF2) intermediates with hydrogen fluoride, which is mildly produced by triethylsilane and silver fluoride. N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides, highly desirable but scarce at present, are easily accessible from these valuable building blocks through an unprecedented route. This study will bring new vitality to the synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds.

         <title>A Dislocated Twin&#8208;Locking Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Configuration for Efficient Delayed Fluorescence with Multiple Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Locking a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) by two spriofluorene groups has led to a rigid dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) configuration that exhibits multiple through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). This emitter shows both efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
Organic materials featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states are advantageous for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), although the realization of multiple TSCT systems remains challenging. Herein, a rigid molecule with a three&#8208;dimensional dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor configuration has been developed by a linking biphenazine (2PXZ) donor and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor through the twin&#8208;locking of two spiro&#8208;fluorene bridges. The twin&#8208;locking construction with multiple TSCT effects suppresses the intramolecular rotations of various segments in 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ, leading to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference, a fast reverse intersystem crossing process, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This material simultaneously possesses the capabilities of TADF and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The device employing 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ as a dopant displays an optimal external quantum efficiency of 27.1&#8201;% and a low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>A Facile Strategy to Obtain Low&#8208;Cost and High&#8208;Performance Gold&#8208;Based Catalysts from Artificial Electronic Waste by [Zr48Ni6] Nano&#8208;Cages in MOFs for CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel metal&#8208;organic framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is the first MOF that can not only extract gold from artificial electronic waste, but then be converted into an effective catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. It offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Expensive gold&#8208;based catalysts are frequently used for electrochemical CO2 reduction into CO. A feasible approach to obtain low&#8208;cost Au&#8208;based catalysts is needed. Herein, a novel framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is prepared. It exhibits a high BET surface area of 1569&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high solvents/pH stability. 1 can not only selectively extract AuCl4&#8722; from artificial electronic waste, but can then be transformed into low&#8208;cost catalyst Au nanoparticle@1&#8208;x (Au NPs@1&#8208;x, x=1, 2, 3, 4) with tuneable Au NPs sizes. The CO2RR investigations revealed that the Au NPs@1&#8208;3 displayed an excellent FECO of 95.2&#8201;% with a current density of 102.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and such high catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 15&#8197;h without obvious decrease because the confinement effect of [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages prevents Au NPs agglomeration. This work offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts for various reactions activated by Au.

         <title>Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous coordination cages (PCCs) are known for their strong intermolecular interaction and high stability for homogeneous catalysis. In this work, a photo&#8208;active molecule, PTH, was assembled into PCC&#8208;40, which showed excellent photocatalytic performance in dehalogenation and photo&#8208;borylation. The synergistic effect of multi catalytic centers was studied. The results may provide future directions for improvement of a large group of photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;catalysis by small&#8208;molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron&#8208;transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;phenothiazine (PTH)&#8208;derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single&#8208;electron transfer, was utilized for photo&#8208;catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage. This discovery provides a potential strategy to improve the photophysical properties and stabilities of small&#8208;molecule organic photocatalysts via supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>&#928;&#8211;&#928; Stacking Complex Induces Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions To Synthesize Functionalized Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reaction for the reductive generation of synthetically important &#945;&#8208;amino radicals proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complex. Multiple &#960; interactions stabilize the reactive intermediate, and neither a photocatalyst nor an initiator are required. This synthetic pathway enabled the synthesis of complex functionalized amines in high yield.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and ion&#8208;pairing interactions induced the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals under the irradiation of visible light without the requirement of an expensive photocatalyst. This strategy enabled the construction of functionalized amines via three&#8208;component coupling reactions with broad scope (we report &gt;50 examples with an up to 90&#8201;% yield). This synthetic pathway also delivered complex functionalized amines with a very high yield. Quantum chemistry Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations identified &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complexes; time&#8208;dependent DFT was employed to simulate the absorption spectra, and nudged elastic band (NEB) methodology provided a possible interaction/reaction picture of the selected species.

Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co layered double oxide yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) are designed as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a two&#8208;step conversion strategy. Owing to the enhanced mass transport of the structure and the modulated chemical environment of metal species, the obtained NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER with good stability.







Abstract
The exploration of earth&#8208;abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a self&#8208;engaged strategy to fabricate a yolk&#8208;shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal&#8211;organic framework, Co&#8208;Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) yolk&#8208;shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF&#8208;67 building blocks are transformed into Ni&#8208;Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co LDH yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) through an ion&#8208;exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 49.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks by Wittig Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Wittig reaction is demonstrated as novel synthetic strategy for the synthesis of crystalline unsubstituted vinylene&#8208;linked 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks through the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity. Ultrafast THz spectroscopy discloses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art charge&#8208;transport properties of as&#8208;prepared V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs as a result of electron delocalization in the fully conjugated frameworks.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have shown great promise in electronics and optoelectronics. However, only a few reactions for V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs have been developed hitherto. Besides the kinetically low reversibility of C=C bond formation, another underlying issue facing the synthesis of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs is the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity to ensure the appropriate symmetry of 2D frameworks. Here, we tailor the E/Z selectivity of the Wittig reaction by employing a proper catalyst (i.e., Cs2CO3) to obtain more stable intermediates and elevating the temperature across the reaction barrier. Subsequently, the Wittig reaction is innovatively utilized for the synthesis of four crystalline V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs by combining aldehydes and ylides. Importantly, the efficient conjugation and decent crystallinity of the resultant V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs are demonstrated by their high charge carrier mobilities over 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, as revealed by non&#8208;contact terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap as a Critical Molecular Descriptor for Predicting Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) is proposed as a critical molecular descriptor to predict organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiency. An unprecedented prediction accuracy is achieved from data&#8208;driven machine learning when combining with two conventional descriptors, optical gap (Eg) and driving force (&#916;EDA), enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of efficient OPV materials.







Abstract
In contrast to the inorganic and perovskite solar cells, organic photovoltaics (OPV) depend on a series of charge generation and recombination processes, which complicates molecular design to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we first propose the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) as a critical molecular descriptor for predicting the PCE considering that minimizing &#916;EST is beneficial to simultaneously reduce voltage loss and triplet recombination. Remarkably, the results from data&#8208;driven machine learning verify that the prediction accuracy of the &#916;EST (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.72) is apparently superior to that of two commonly used molecular descriptors in OPV, i.e., the optical gap (r=0.65) and the driving force (r=0.53). Moreover, an impressive prediction accuracy of r=0.81 is achieved just by combining the three descriptors. This work paves the way toward rapid and precise screening of efficient OPV materials.

         <title>Substrate Induced Movement of the Metal Cofactor between Active and Resting State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It requires a substrate to be active. Pyruvate dependent Class II aldolases require a ketoacid to induce a metal shift from resting state to active enzyme. This occurs without alterations in the protein structure and might be a common, but to date overlooked, feature in many metalloproteins.







Abstract
Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far&#8208;reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor's properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (SwHKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M2+R), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M2+A) at 2.4&#8197;&#197; distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M2+A affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M2+R to M2+A. While not described earlier, this type of regulation may be widespread and largely overlooked due to low occupancy of some of its states in protein crystal structures.

         <dc:description>Treatment of phosphino(imino)pyridine (PIP) molybdenum cyclooctadiene (COD) complexes [(PIP)Mo(COD)] with dihydrogen in the presence of benzene selectively furnished the molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)], which are precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] arises from a rarely observed insertion of benzene into a molybdenum&#8211;hydride bond, a key step in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation of arenes. The reaction with toluene afforded a single isomer of the corresponding molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydride while para&#8208;xylene instead predominantly formed the molybdenum &#951;6&#8208;arene complex with the insertion product being a minor component. Addition of carbon monoxide to a cyclohexane&#8208;d12 solution of [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] liberated cyclohexadiene, providing experimental support for a higher kinetic barrier for the subsequent steps en route to cycloalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Electroluminescent Elastomers with Self&#8208;Confinement Effect for Highly Efficient Non&#8208;Blended Stretchable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are emerging as a basic component of flexible electronics and human&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the brightness and efficiency of stretchable OLEDs remain still far inferior to their rigid counterparts, owing to the scarcity of satisfactory stretchable electroluminescent materials. Herein, we explore a general concept based on the self&#8208;confinement effect to dramatically improve the stretchability of elastomers, without affecting electroluminescent properties. The balanced rigid/flexible chain dynamics under self&#8208;confinement significantly reduces the modulus of the elastomers, resulting in the maximum strain reaching 806%. Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable OLEDs have been constructed based on the resulting ISEEs, achieving unprecedented high&#8208;performance non&#8208;blended stretchable OLEDs. The results suggest an effective molecular design strategy for highly deformable stretchable displays and flexible electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Decarboxylative Protonation Enabled by Cooperative Earth&#8208;Abundant Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative protonation is a general deletion tactic to replace polar carboxylic acid groups with hydrogen or its isotope. Current methods rely on the pre&#8208;activation of acids, non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen sources, and/or expensive/highly oxidizing photocatalysts, presenting challenges to their wide adoption. Here we show that a cooperative iron/thiol catalyst system can readily achieve this transformation, hydrodecarboxylating a wide range of activated and unactivated carboxylic acids and overcoming scope limitations in previous direct methods. The reaction is readily scaled in batch configuration and can be directly performed in deuterated solvent to afford high yields of d&#8208;incorporated products with excellent isotope incorporation efficiency; characteristics not attainable in previous photocatalyzed approaches. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a radical mechanism and kinetic results of unactivated acids (KIE = 1) are consistent with a light&#8208;limited reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Twisted [N]Cycloparaphenylene by Alkene Insertion</title>

Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the strips formed by the &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1 and 2 exhibited a M&#246;bius topology in the solid state. While the M&#246;bius topology in the parent 1 and 2 in a solution was lost due to the free rotation of the paraphenylene unit even at low temperatures, ene&#8208;[6]CPP 4 with eight 1&#8208;pyrrolyl groups preserved the M&#246;bius topology even in a solution. Despite a twist, 1 has in&#8208;plane conjugation and possesses a unique size dependence of the electronic properties; i.e., the opposite size dependency of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy relative to conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Polycyclic Molecules via Ring Fusion for n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The primary challenge for n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is to improve their electron mobilities and thus the key figure of merit  &#956;C  *. Nevertheless, few reports in OECTs have specially proposed to address this issue. Herein, we report a 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system consisting of the core of naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin dimer and the terminal moieties of rhodamine, which features intramolecular noncovalent interactions, high &#960;&#8208;delocalization and strong electron&#8208;deficient characteristics. We find that this extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using the ring fusion strategy displays improved electron mobilities up to 0.043 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  compared to our previously reported small molecule gNR, and thereby leads to a remarkable  &#956;C  * of 10.3 F cm  &#8722;1  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  in n&#8208;type OECTs, which is the highest value reported to date for small&#8208;molecule OECTs. This work highlights the importance of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension in polycyclic&#8208;fused molecules for enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OECTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Iron(II) Oxide Sites Directly Responsible for Preferential Carbon Monoxide Oxidation at Ambient Temperature: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identified that the concentration of Fe2+ species in the working state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;FeOx catalysts quantitatively correlates to their preferential carbon monoxide oxidation steady&#8208;state reaction rate at ambient temperature. Deactivation of such catalysts with time on stream originates from irreversible oxidation of active Fe2+ sites. The active Fe2+ species are presumably Fe+2O&#8208;2 clusters in contact with platinum nanoparticles; they coexist with spectator trivalent oxidic iron (Fe3+) and metallic iron (Fe0) partially alloyed with platinum. The concentration of active sites and, therefore, the catalyst activity strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions. Fe2+ is the resting state of the active sites in the preferential carbon monoxide oxidation cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Electroformation of Gold Nanoparticles in Nanoliter Droplet Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing, and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are formed on a microfluidic device and exposed to an electrical current by guiding them through a pair of parallel electrodes. We exploit the naturally occurring recirculation flows inside confined droplets (moving in rectangular microchannels) to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles after nucleation. Therefore, AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100 nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. The average particle size is defined by the precursor concentration and droplet velocity, while the charge dose given by the electric field strength has a minor effect. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles, and we believe it is a versatile method for the formation of other metal nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex featuring a [PdMg3H3] core with H2  is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species alongside an equivalent of a magnesium hydride co&#8208;product [MgH]. While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg2H4], analogous [PtMg2H4] and [PtZn2H4] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni&#8208;Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal&#8211;metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic zwitterionic&#160;Streptococcus pneumoniae&#160;type 1 oligosaccharides carrying labile&#160;O&#8208;acetyl esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report the first total synthesis of the&#160;Streptococcus&#160;pneumoniae&#160;serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharide, a unique zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide carrying labile&#160;O&#8208;acetyl esters. The target oligosaccharides, featuring the rare&#160;a&#8208;2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy galactose (AAT) and&#160;a&#8208;galacturonic acids, were assembled up to the 9&#8208;mer level, in a highly stereoselective manner using trisaccharide building blocks.&#160;The lability of the&#160;O&#8208;acetyl esters imposed a careful deprotection scheme to prevent migration and hydrolysis. The migration was investigated in detail at various pD values using NMR spectroscopy, to show that migration and hydrolysis of the C&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl esters readily takes place under neutral conditions. Structural investigation showed the oligomers to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure with the acetyl esters exposed on the periphery of the helix in close proximity of the neighboring AAT residues, thereby imposing conformational restrictions on the AAT&#945;1&#8722;4GalA(3OAc) glycosidic linkages, supporting the helical shape of the polysaccharide, that has been proposed to be critical for its unique biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Influence of Lone Pairs in GeP2N4, a Germanium(II) Nitridophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their widespread properties, nitridophosphates are of high interest in current research. Explorative high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature investigations yielded various compounds with stoichiometry MP2N4 (M = Be, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cd), which are discussed as ultra&#8208;hard or luminescent materials, when doped with Eu2+. Herein, we report the first germanium nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, synthesized from Ge3N4 and P3N5 at 6&#160;GPa and 800&#160;&#176;C. The structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, IR and NMR spectroscopy. The highly condensed network of PN4&#8208;tetrahedra shows a strong structural divergence to other MP2N4 compounds, which is attributed to the stereochemical influence of the lone pair of Ge2+. Thus, the formal exchange of alkaline earth cations with Ge2+ may open access to various compounds with literature&#8208;known stoichiometry, however, new structures and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Strategy for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Sulfoglycolipids from&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;To Elucidate the Structure and Immunomodulatory Property Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a versatile asymmetric strategy to synthesize different classes of sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) from  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  , namely SL&#8208;I (  1  ), SL&#8208;II (  2  ), SL&#8208;III (  3  ), SL&#8208;IVs (  4  ), (  5  ), and monoacyl Ac  1  SGL (  6  ). The strategy featured the use of asymmetrically&#8208;protected trehaloses, which were acquired from glycosylation of TMS  &#945;  &#8208;glucosyl acceptors with benzylidene protected thioglucosyl donors. The positions of the protecting groups at the donors and acceptors can be fine&#8208;tuned to obtain different protecting group patterns, which are crucial for regioselective acylation and sulfation. In addition, a chemoenzymatic strategy was established to prepare the polymethylated fatty acid building blocks. The strategy employs (i) inexpensive lipase as a desymmetrization agent in preparation of starting substrate and (ii) readily&#8208;available chiral oxazolidinone as a chiral&#8208;controlling agent in construction of the polymethylated fatty acids. Subsequent investigation on immunomodulatory property of each class of SGLs showed how the structures of SGLs impact the host innate immunity response.</dc:description>

         <title>Interparticle Charge&#8208;Transport&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Quantum&#8208;Dot Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) represents a widely explored technique to generate light, in which the emission intensity relies critically on the charge&#8208;transfer reactions between electrogenerated radicals. Two types of charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms have been postulated for ECL generation, but the manipulation and effective probing of these routes remain a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate the design of quantum dot (QD) aerogels as novel ECL luminophores via a versatile water&#8208;induced gelation strategy. The strong electronic coupling between adjacent QDs enables efficient charge transport within the aerogel network, leading to the generation of highly efficient ECL based on the selectively improved interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route. This mechanism is further verified by designing CdSe&#8208;CdTe mixed QD aerogels, where the two mechanistic routes are clearly decoupled for ECL generation. We anticipate our work will advance the fundamental understanding of ECL and prove useful for designing next&#8208;generation QD&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed herein is RhCl3&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;substituted naphthalenes, which provides a highly efficient and streamlined approach to chalcogen&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes from readily available starting materials. Introducing O, S, and Se into the anthanthrene skeleton leads to gradually increased &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distances but significantly enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlaps with the growth of heteroatomic radius. Moderate &#960;&#8208;&#960; distance, overlap area, and intermolecular S&#8208;S interactions endow S&#8208;embedded anthanthrene (PTT) with excellent 2D charge&#8208;transport properties. Moreover, the transformation of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type S&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes is realized for the first time via the S&#8208;atom oxidation from PTT to PTT&#8208;O4. In organic field&#8208;effect transistor devices, PTT derivatives exhibit hole transport properties with mobilities up to 1.1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, while PTT&#8208;O4 shows an electron transport property with a mobility of 0.022 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complex Doped Photothermal Hydrogels for Discriminating Circularly Polarized Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels behave as potential candidates to investigate circularly polarized light (CP)&#8208;matter interaction, which however suffer from small sensitivity towards circular polarization. Here we report a general protocol to build hydrogels from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids with coassembled charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes, covering a wide scope of donors and acceptors, which were incorporated into stable hydrogel matrices. CT complexes formed block coassemblies with gelators, induced the emergence of macroscopic chiral helices, where efficient chirality transfer occurs to realize tunable Cotton effects from visible light to NIR&#8208;I region depending on the structures of CT pairs. The hybrid hydrogels showed tunable photothermal performances with excellent heating&#8208;cooling cycling durability. Circularly polarized NIR light selectively triggered gel&#8208;solution phase transition at different timescales. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;CP illumination generates up to 2.5 folds difference in gel collapse time that allows for direct discrimination by naked eyes.</dc:description>

Here we report a general protocol to build hydrogels from &#960;-conjugated amino acids with coassembled charge-transfer (CT) complexes, covering a wide scope of donors and acceptors, which were incorporated into stable hydrogel matrices. CT complexes formed block coassemblies with gelators, induced the emergence of macroscopic chiral helices, where efficient chirality transfer occurs to realize tunable Cotton effects from visible light to NIR-I region depending on the structures of CT pairs. The hybrid hydrogels showed tunable photothermal performances with excellent heating-cooling cycling durability. Circularly polarized NIR light selectively triggered gel-solution phase transition at different timescales. Left- and right-CP illumination generates up to 2.5 folds difference in gel collapse time that allows for direct discrimination by naked eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction of&#160;&#945;&#8208;Ketoesters: Development and Application to the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstratine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an asymmetric Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction of a&#8208;ketoesters. In the presence of a catalytic amount of simple alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, reaction of tryptamines with methyl 2&#8208;oxoalkanoates affords the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and enantiomeric excesses. A primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE = 4.5) using C2&#8208;deteurium labelled tryptamine indicates that rearomatization via deprotonation of the pentahydro&#8208;b&#8208;carbolinium ion could be the rate and enantioselectivity determining step. A concise enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstratine A, a hexacyclic cagelike monoterpene indole alkaloid, featuring this reaction as a key step, is subsequently accomplished. Re&#8208;measurement of the natural product&#8217;s [&#945;]D indicates that natural alstratine A is dextrorotatory rather than levorotatory as it is initially reported in the isolation paper.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein the first examples of chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2&#8208;trifluoroacetamido&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes 1 and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds 2 . The polysubstituted 1&#8208;acetamido cyclohexenes 3 are formed in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The reaction proceeds through a stepwise process as shown by deuterium labelling experiment. A catalytic enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of 1 ,  2 and orthohydroxybenzhydryl alcohols 4 is subsequently developed furnishing densely functionalized hexahydroxanthenes 5 in a highly stereoselective manner. This multicomponent reaction generates four chemical bonds with concurrent creation of five contiguous stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous frameworks composed of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed multicomponent molecules attract much attention from a functional viewpoint. however, their designed preparation and precise structural characterization remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that cocrystallization of tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives (CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py, respectively) yields non&#8208;stoichiometric mixed frameworks through networking via hydrogen bonding. The composition ratio of CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py in the framework was determined by single crystalline X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, indicating that the mixed frameworks were formed over a wide range of composition ratios. Furthermore, microscopic Raman spectroscopy on the single crystal indicates that the components are not uniformly distributed such as ideal solid solution, but are done gradationally or inhomogeneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic DNA&#8208;Assisted Mass Production of Arbitrary Single&#8208;Stranded DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is a cornerstone for life and materials science, yet the purity, quantity, length, and customizability of synthetic DNA are still limiting in various applications. Here we present PECAN, paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (DNA enzymes or deoxyribozymes), which enables mass production of ssDNA of arbitrary sequence (up to 7,000 nucleotides, or nt) with single&#8208;base precision. At the core of PECAN technique are two newly&#8208;identified classes of DNAzymes, each robustly self&#8208;hydrolyzing with minimal sequence requirement up&#8208; or down&#8208;stream of its cleavage site. Flanking the target ssDNA with a pair of such DNAzymes generates a precursor ssDNA amplifiable by pseudogene&#8208;recombinant bacteriophage, which subsequently releases the target ssDNA in large quantities after efficient auto&#8208;processing. PECAN produces ssDNA of virtually any terminal bases and compositions with &gt;98.5% purity at the milligram&#8208;to&#8208;gram scale. We demonstrate the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for RNA in situ detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Switching Cu(II)/Cu(I) Single Sites Catalyze High&#8208;rate and Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we first design a model of reversible redox&#8208;switching&#160;metal&#8211;organic framework single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets, where the abundant metal single sites benefit for highly selective CO2 reduction, while the reversible redox&#8208;switching metal sites can effectively activate CO2 molecules. Taking the synthetic Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectra unravel the reversible switching Cu(II)/Cu(I) single sites initially accept photoexcited electrons and then donate them to CO2 molecules, which favors the rate&#8208;liming activation into CO2&#948;&#8208;, verified by in&#8208;situ FTIR spectra and Gibbs free energy calculations. As an outcome, Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets achieve near 100% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CO with a high rate of 860 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without any sacrifice reagent or photosensitizer, where both the activity and selectivity outperform previously reported photocatalysts evaluated under similar conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Multiple Domain Ligation for Proteins using Asparaginyl Endopeptidase by Selection of Appropriate Ligation Sites Based on Steric Hindrance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three domain fragments of a multi&#8208;domain protein, ER&#8208;60, were ligated in two short linker regions using asparaginyl endopeptidase not involving denaturation. To identify appropriate ligation sites, by selecting several potential ligation sites with fewer mutations around two short linker regions, their ligation efficiencies and the functions of the ligated ER&#8208;60s were examined experimentally. To evaluate the dependence of ligation efficiencies on the ligation sites computationally, steric hinderances around the sites for the ligation were calculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Utilizing the steric hindrance, a site&#8208;dependent ligation potential index was introduced as reproducing the experimental ligation efficiency. Referring to this index, the reconstruction of ER&#8208;60 was succeeded by the ligation of the three domains for the first time. In addition, the new ligation potential index well&#8208;worked for application to other domain ligations. Therefore, the index may serve as a more time&#8208;effective tool for multi&#8208;site ligations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pair@Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a New Platform for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation, a seminal strategy for the synthesis of chiral molecules, remains largely unmet in terms of activation by non&#8208;metal sites of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, as demonstrated by combined computational and experimental studies, we present a general strategy for integrating rationally designed molecular chiral frustrated Lewis pair (CFLP) with porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to construct the catalyst CFLP@MOF that can efficiently promote the asymmetric hydrogenation in a heterogeneous manner, which for the first time extends the concept of chiral frustrated Lewis pair from homogeneous system to heterogeneous catalysis. Significantly, the developed CFLP@MOF, inherits the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, with high activity/enantio&#8208;selectivity and excellent recyclability/regenerability. Our work not only advances CFLP@MOF as a new platform for heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation, but also opens a new avenue for the design and preparation of advanced catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Ring Contraction of Peptide Macrocycles Using Cornforth Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective transformations of densely functionalized scaffolds have been a topic of intense interest in chemical synthesis. Herein we have repurposed the rarely used Cornforth rearrangement as a tool to effect a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in cyclic peptide backbones. Investigations into the kinetics of the rearrangement were carried out to understand the impact of electronic factors, ring size, and linker type on the reaction efficiency. Conformational analysis was undertaken and showed how subtle differences in the peptide backbone result in substrate&#8208;dependent reaction profiles. This methodology can now be used to perform conformation&#8208;activity studies. The chemistry also offers an opportunity to install building blocks that are not compatible with traditional C&#8208;to&#8208;N iterative synthesis of macrocycle precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient production of nanoporous block copolymers with&#160;arbitrary structural characters for advanced membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The great significance of boosting the design of percolating nanopore structures in block copolymers (BCPs) for varied use cases has been widely demonstrated in the past several decades. However, it still remains challenging to prepare the desired porous structures in a rapid, facile, and universal manner. Here we develop an unconventional and benchtop strategy to rapidly generate the nanoporous BCPs with arbitrary structural characters regardless of the BCP bulk morphology. This universal pore&#8208;forming strategy enables the sustainable CO2&#8208;based BCPs to form the advanced membranes with 1 s soaking for efficiently rejecting 94.2% brilliant blue R (826 g/mol). At the same time, the water permeance retains around 1020 L/(m2&#183;h&#183;bar), which is 1~3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other membranes. This strategy may offer a fantastic opportunity to introduce percolating pore structures in those newly developed BCPs with which the previously reported pore&#8208;forming methods may not deal.</dc:description>

         <title>Far&#8208;Red Molecular Rotor Fluorogenic Trehalose Probe for Live Mycobacteria Detection and Drug&#8208;Susceptibility Testing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the speed, specificity, sensitivity, and accessibility of mycobacteria detection tools are important challenges for tuberculosis (TB) research and diagnosis. In this regard, previously reported fluorogenic trehalose analogues have shown potential, but their green&#8208;emitting dyes may limit sensitivity and applications in complex settings. Here, we describe a trehalose&#8208;based fluorogenic probe featuring a molecular rotor turn&#8208;on fluorophore with bright far&#8208;red emission (RMR&#8208;Tre). RMR&#8208;Tre, which exploits the unique biosynthetic enzymes and environment of the mycobacterial outer membrane to achieve fluorescence activation, enables fast, no&#8208;wash, low&#8208;background fluorescence detection of live mycobacteria. Aided by the red&#8208;shifted molecular rotor fluorophore, RMR&#8208;Tre exhibited up to a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in M. tuberculosis labeling compared to existing fluorogenic trehalose probes. We show that RMR&#8208;Tre reports on M. tuberculosis drug resistance in a facile assay, demonstrating its potential as a TB diagnostic tool.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Photophysics in Hydrazone&#8208;based Hierarchical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confinement&#8208;imposed photophysics was probed for novel stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrazone&#8208;based compounds demonstrating a conceptual difference in their behavior within 2D versus 3D porous matrices for the first time. The challenges associated with photoswitch isomerization arising from host interactions with photochromic compounds in 2D scaffolds could be overcome in 3D materials. Solution&#8208;like photoisomerization rate constants were realized for sterically demanding hydrazone derivatives in the solid state through their coordinative immobilization in 3D scaffolds. According to steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements and theoretical modeling, this approach provides access to hydrazone&#8208;based materials with fast photoisomerization kinetics in the solid state. Fast isomerization of integrated hydrazone derivatives allows for probing and tailoring resonance energy transfer (ET) processes as a function of excitation wavelength, providing a novel pathway for ET modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Changes of C&#8211;H Bond Lengths in Chiral Zinc Complexes Induced by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to better understand the effect of the non&#8208;covalent weak interactions on the molecule, we have explored a variety of weak interactions such as improper H&#8208;bonding (HB), tetrel bonds (TBs) and halogen bonds, in fluorinated chiral zinc complexes. High resolution neutron diffraction studies revealed the methylene carbon hydrogen bonds elongation and shortening due to the TB and improper HB interactions, respectively. To show the accumulative effects of multiple weak interactions on the C&#8208;H bond, three types of tetrel bonds have been carefully examined. We have also shown how the C&#8208;H bond elongation can be easily offset by forming an improper HB with the H atom from this C&#8208;H bond. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and electrostatic potential analysis investigations have been used to affirm the nature of the interactions based on density functional theory (DFT) and other related calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Anthrone&#8208;based Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthrones and analogues are structural cores shared by diverse pharmacologically active natural and synthetic compounds. The sp  2  &#8208;rich nature imposes inherent obstruction to introduce stereogenic element onto the tricyclic aromatic backbone. In our pursuit to expand the chemical space of axial chirality, a novel type of axially chiral anthrone&#8208;derived skeleton was discovered. This work establishes oxime ether as suitable functionality to furnish axial chirality on symmetric anthrone skeletons through stereoselective condensation of the carbonyl entity with long&#8208;range chirality control. The enantioenriched anthrones could be elaborated into dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered  N  &#8208;heterocycles containing well&#8208;defined stereogenic center via Beckmann rearrangement with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral imidodiphosphates (IDPs) have emerged as strong Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts for many enantioselective processes, however, the dynamic transformation between O,O&#8208;syn and O,O&#8208;anti conformers results in typical low enantioselectivity. Here we demonstrate that topologies of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be exploited to control IDP conformations and local chiral microenvironments for enantioselective catalysis. Two porous Dy&#8208;MOFs with different topologies are made from an enantiopure 1,1'&#8208;biphenol IDP&#8208;based tetracarboxylate ligand. Whereas the ligand adopts a 4&#8208; or 3&#8208;connected (c) binding mode, all IDPs are rigidified to take only a single O,O&#8208;syn conformation and display greatly enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity relative to the free IDP. The MOF with the 4&#8208;c IDP that takes a relative less compact shape than the 3&#8208;c one can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid to catalyse the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization reaction with up to 96% enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

Here we demonstrate that topologies of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be exploited to control IDP conformations and local chiral microenvironments for enantioselective catalysis. Two porous Dy-MOFs with different topologies are made from an enantiopure 1,1'-biphenol IDP-based tetracarboxylate ligand. Whereas the ligand adopts a 4- or 3-connected (c) binding mode, all IDPs are rigidified to take only a single O,O-syn conformation and display greatly enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity relative to the free IDP. The MOF with the 4-c IDP that takes a relative less compact shape than the 3-c one can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid to catalyse the challenging asymmetric O,O-acetalization reaction with up to 96% enantiomeric excess.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar&#8208;Driven Syngas Production: A Fe2O3 Photoanode Featuring Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Integrated with a Silver&#8208;&#8208;Palladium Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical syngas production from aqueous CO2 is a promising technique for carbon capture and utilization. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and tunable syngas production by integrating a single&#8208;atom cobalt catalyst decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with a bimetallic Ag/Pd alloy cathode. A record syngas production activity of 81.9 &#181;mol&#8226;cm&#8208;2&#8226;h&#8208;1 (CO/H2 ratio: ~1:1) has been achieved under artificial sunlight (AM 1.5 G) with an excellent durability. Systematic studies reveal that the Co single&#8208;atom could effectively extract the holes from Fe2O3 photoanodes and serve as active&#8208;sites for promoting oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the Pd and Ag atoms in bimetallic cathodes could selectively adsorb CO2 and protons for facilitating CO production. Further incorporating with a photovoltaic for utilizing the solar&#8208;light (&gt;600 nm) to construct a bias&#8208;free CO2 reduction device, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO and solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion efficiencies could be achieved up to 1.36 and 1.33 %, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Multicolour Luminescence of Organic Materials: Internal Mechanism and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excitation&#8208;dependent emission (Ex&#8208;de) materials have been of considerable academic interest and have potential applications in real life. Such multicolour luminescence is a characteristic exception to the ubiquitously accepted Kasha&#8217;s rule. This phenomenon has been increasingly presented in some studies on different luminescence systems; however, a systematic overview of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is currently absent. Herein, we resolve this issue by classifying multicolour luminescence from single chromophores and dual/ternary chromophores, as well as multiple emitting species. The underlying processes are described based on electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which the phenomenon occurs. Before we present it in categories, related photophysical and photochemical foundations are introduced. This systematic overview will provide a clear approach to designing multicolour luminescence materials for special applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Broad&#8208;range&#8208;response pressure&#8208;sensitive wearable electronics are urgently needed but their preparation remains a challenge. Herein, we report unprecedented bioinspired wearable electronics based on stretchable and superelastic reduced graphene oxide/polyurethane nanocomposite aerogels with gradient porous structures by a sol&#8208;gel/hot pressing/freeze casting/ambient pressure drying strategy. The gradient structure with a hot&#8208;pressed layer promotes strain transfer and resistance variation under high pressures, leading to an ultrabroad detection range of 1 Pa&#8208;12.6 MPa, one of the broadest ranges ever reported. They can withstand 10000 compression cycles under 1 MPa, which can&#8217;t be achieved by traditional flexible pressure sensors. They can be applied for broad&#8208;range&#8208;response electronic skins and monitoring various physical signals/motions and ultrahigh pressures of automobile tires. Moreover, the gradient aerogels can be used as high&#8208;efficient gradient separators for water purification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The emergence of hollow nanoreactors offers a potential opportunity for achieving a better catalytic performance owing to the higher controllability of molecular kinetic behavior within the hollow nanoreactors. Nevertheless, the specific molecular catalytic mechanism occurring inside hollow nanoreactors still remains to be adequately recognized, which is crucial for inducing controllable molecular behaviors with specific purposes. This review article presents a focused discussion about the basic concept of hollow nanoreactors, the underlying theory for hollow nanoreactor&#8208;driven kinetics, and the intrinsic correlation between nanoreactor structural parameters and kinetic behaviors, in an attempt to realizing controllable catalysis. We aim to provide in&#8208;depth insights into understanding kinetics within typical hollow nanoreactors.

         <title>Sulfenofunctionalization of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Synthesis of SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized chiral allyl species, with an alkenyl CF3 group, were prepared with excellent selectivity by selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of allylboronic acids. The method can be used to access chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr compounds.







Abstract
We report herein a new method for the synthesis of densely functionalized chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr species with a separate CF3 functionality. The synthetic approach is based on selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of chiral &#945;&#8208;CF3 allylboronic acids. The reactions proceeded with remarkably high stereo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, based on the formation of a stable thiiranium ion followed by rapid deborylative ring opening.

         <title>Ion Adsorption and Desorption at the CaF2&#8208;Water Interface Probed by Flow Experiments and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>

Uncovering Ion Adsorption Reactions. The combination of surface&#8208;sensitive v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments allows to uncover the interplay of a dominant fluoride and a weak calcium adsorption reaction at the fluorite&#8208;water interface. This is enabled by systematically changing bulk concentrations and suppression of fluoride dissolution.







Abstract
The dissolution of minerals in contact with water plays a crucial role in geochemistry. However, obtaining molecular insight into interfacial chemistry is challenging. Dissolution typically involves the release of ions from the surface, giving rise to a charged mineral surface. This charge affects the interfacial water arrangement, which can be investigated by surface&#8208;specific vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (v&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy. For the fluorite&#8208;water interface, recent spectroscopic studies concluded that fluoride adsorption/desorption determines the surface charge, which contrasts zeta potential measurements assigning this role to the calcium ion. By combining v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments with systematically suppressed dissolution, we uncover the interplay of dominant fluoride and weak calcium adsorption/desorption, resolving the controversy in the literature. We infer the calcium contribution to be orders of magnitude smaller, emphasizing the sensitivity of our approach.

The combination of surface-sensitive v-SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments allows to uncover the interplay of a dominant fluoride and a weak calcium adsorption reaction at the fluorite-water interface. This is enabled by systematically changing bulk concentrations and suppression of fluoride dissolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dissolution of minerals in contact with water plays a crucial role in geochemistry. However, obtaining molecular insight into interfacial chemistry is challenging. Dissolution typically involves the release of ions from the surface, giving rise to a charged mineral surface. This charge affects the interfacial water arrangement, which can be investigated by surface-specific vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (v-SFG) spectroscopy. For the fluorite-water interface, recent spectroscopic studies concluded that fluoride adsorption/desorption determines the surface charge, which contrasts zeta potential measurements assigning this role to the calcium ion. By combining v-SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments with systematically suppressed dissolution, we uncover the interplay of dominant fluoride and weak calcium adsorption/desorption, resolving the controversy in the literature. We infer the calcium contribution to be orders of magnitude smaller, emphasizing the sensitivity of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Pyridine&#8208;Stabilized N&#8208;Phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboravinyl Cation: Boron Analogue of Vinyl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;diboravinyl cation was obtained through the displacement reaction of the bromide substituent on a diborene derivative using pyridine. This newly formed species was shown to be a boron analogue of the vinyl cation which could be used for the activation of small molecules.







Abstract
A boron analogue of vinyl cation, pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboravinyl cation 2+, was synthesized by displacement of bromide in diborene 1 with excess pyridine. Experimental and computational studies showed that the positive charge is mainly at the B&#8722;B skeleton with delocalization to the pyridine ligand. One of the main modes of reactivity is through the B=B double bond alongside activation of the pyridine substituent, where the Bpyridine center is the predominant nucleophilic center and the predominant electrophilic center is either the activated pyridine para position or the BNHC center, illustrating the presence of diborene cation A, borylene&#8208;borenium cation B and diborene&#8208;pyridinium cation C resonance structures in cation 2+.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Based Engineering of the Active Pocket of D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase Leading to Highly Improved Specificity toward D&#8208;Glufosinate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilicity&#8208;based triple&#8208;code site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (S&#8208;T&#8208;Q) was applied to the wild&#8208;type enzyme RgDAAO, leading to a mutant Zn7 with greater than 2000&#8208;fold improvement in specific activity toward the unnatural substrate D&#8208;glufosinate, which was converted into PPO, a precursor of an excellent herbicide, L&#8208;PPT. Computational analysis revealed that the higher activity was mainly caused by an extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity.







Abstract
Due to its stringent stereospecificity, D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has made it very easy to synthesize L&#8208;amino acids. However, the low activity of the wild&#8208;type enzyme toward unnatural substrates, such as D&#8208;glufosinate (D&#8208;PPT), restricts its application. In this study, DAAO from Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO) was directly evolved using a hydrophilicity&#8208;substitution saturation mutagenesis strategy, yielding a mutant with significantly increased catalytic activity against D&#8208;PPT. The mutant displays distinct catalytic properties toward hydrophilic substrates as compared to numerous WT&#8208;DAAOs. The analysis of homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation suggest that the extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity was the reason for the enhanced activity. The current study established an enzymatic synthetic route to L&#8208;PPT, an excellent herbicide, with high efficiency, and the proposed strategy provides a new viewpoint on enzyme engineering for the biosynthesis of unnatural amino acids.

         <title>Ynamide&#8208;Mediated Peptide Bond Formation: Mechanistic Study and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynamide coupling reagents combine the advantages of conventional active esters and coupling reagents, while overcoming their disadvantages, and exhibit superiority in addressing the notorious racemization/epimerization issue. The applicability of ynamide coupling reagents has been successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization, and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis on the basis of a systematic mechanistic study.







Abstract
Ynamides, a class of novel coupling reagents for peptide synthesis, facilitated peptide bond formation in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step manner with &#945;&#8208;acyloxyenamide active esters of amino acids as stable intermediates. Ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide synthesis proceeded by a reaction mechanism that is completely different from that of conventional coupling reagents and exhibited superiority in addressing the issue of racemization/epimerization during peptide bond formation. Herein, we present a systematic mechanistic analysis, including kinetics and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type structure&#8211;reactivity studies and density functional theory calculations, providing unprecedented mechanistic insight into ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation. Based on these mechanistic studies, significant improvements were made, and the applicability of ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation was successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type amphiphilic supramolecular megamer is presented. It exhibits an unprecedented hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process in aqueous solution. The self&#8208;assembled structures formed by the megamer evolve from vesicles to vesosomes and eventually to a peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tubes as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside it as the peas.







Abstract
This study presents interesting self&#8208;assembly of peapod&#8208;like micrometer tubes from a planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type supramolecular megamer, which was constructed through the specific host&#8211;guest molecular recognition between azobenzene (AZO)&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly(ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol)&#8208;star&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (HSP&#8208;AZO) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin(CD)&#8208;based hydrophilic hyperbranched polyglycerol (CD&#8208;g&#8208;HPG). A peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tube as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside as the peas was formed through sequential vesicle entosis, linear association, and fusion processes. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations support the structural possibility of the supramolecular peapod formation and its mechanism. UV light irradiation could lead to the disassembly of the peapod&#8208;like structure. This study expands the family of supramolecular polymers and opens a new avenue to develop bioinspired complex hierarchical nanoarchitectures at the microscopic level.

A versatile method allows zeolite nanosheets (NSs) to be prepared from single&#8208;species amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs). The AAS&#8208;NSs were prepared by the two&#8208;dimensional reactor in amphiphilic phases (TRAP) method. Using this approach four zeolite types were prepared from single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs by the dry gel conversion (DGC) process with structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs).







Abstract
Zeolites catalyze some reactions in their molecular&#8208;sized pores, but large molecules can react only on their external surface. Zeolite&#8208;nanosheets (NSs) have been developed as catalysts for large molecules. The previously reported methods to synthesize zeolite&#8208;NSs are specialized for each zeolite type. Here we propose a new method to synthesize various zeolite&#8208;NSs from the same amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs) as a universal precursor. We successfully synthesized the unprecedented AAS&#8208;NSs in the hydrophilic space of the stable hyperswollen lyotropic lamellar (HL) phase. The four zeolite types could be obtained from the single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs. These results imply that this method enables us to synthesize almost all types of zeolite&#8208;NSs. Moreover, the synthesized CHA&#8208;NSs have great potential for various applications because of their thickness and large external surface area.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Properties of Cryptophazane&#8212;A Soluble and Functionalizable C1&#8208;Symmetrical Cryptophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptophanes are molecular hosts of particular interest for the development of biosensors based on xenon magnetic resonance imaging as they bind xenon reversibly. To prepare such a biosensor, a reactive site on the cryptophane core, which is desirable for such applications but synthetically challenging, has now been introduced by replacing a crown methylene bridge by a nitrogen atom to form a cryptophazane.







Abstract
The first example of a cryptophazane, a cryptophane functionalized with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the methylene bridges, is obtained with a 28&#8201;% overall yield over 8 steps, through the preparation of a C1&#8208;symmetrical aza&#8208;cyclotriveratrylene (aza&#8208;CTV). Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of a nitrogen atom on this part of the cryptophane core enhances the solubility in organic media of both the cryptophane and the synthetic intermediates, while presenting the same conformation as known cryptophanes. Cryptophazane was prepared on a multigram scale and easily functionalized. We also investigated its ability to encapsulate xenon atoms using hyperpolarized 129Xe (HP 129Xe) NMR spectroscopy. We found that both its affinity and exchange kinetics were in the appropriate range for applications in 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combined with the wide range of possible functionalization, this makes cryptophazane an excellent candidate for targeted HP 129Xe MRI.

         <title>Luciferase&#8208;free Luciferin Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spectral tuning&#8212;from green to red&#8212;of luciferase&#8208;free luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was demonstrated by means of electrolyte engineering. The color change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and brings evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state by double layer electric fields. Visual mapping of ECL and fluorescence fronts enables the optical quantitation of superoxide and oxyluciferin diffusivities.







Abstract
Luciferin is one of Nature's most widespread luminophores, and enzymes that catalyze luciferin luminescence are the basis of successful commercial &#8220;glow&#8221; assays for gene expression and metabolic ATP formation. Herein we report an electrochemical method to promote firefly's luciferin luminescence in the absence of its natural biocatalyst&#8212;luciferase. We have gained experimental and computational insights on the mechanism of the enzyme&#8208;free luciferin electrochemiluminescence, demonstrated its spectral tuning from green to red by means of electrolyte engineering, proven that the colour change does not require, as still debated, a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter, and gained evidence of the electrostatic&#8208;assisted stabilization of the charge&#8208;transfer excited state by double layer electric fields. Luciferin's electrochemiluminescence, as well as the in situ generation of fluorescent oxyluciferin, are applied towards an optical measurement of diffusion coefficients.

         <title>Full Control of the Chiral Overpass Effect in Helical Polymers: P/M Screw Sense Induction by Remote Chiral Centers After Bypassing the First Chiral Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical sense induction in polymers is usually commanded by the chiral residue directly attached to the polymer backbone. In this work, it is demonstrated that either a P or M helical sense can be induced into a poly(phenylacetylene) by activation of a chiral overpass effect followed by selective manipulation of the conformational composition at a remote chiral center.







Abstract
In helical polymers, helical sense induction is usually commanded by teleinduction mechanism, where the largest substituent of the chiral residue directly attached to the main chain is the one that commands the helical sense. In this work, different helical structures with different helical senses are induced in a helical polymer [poly&#8208;(phenylacetylene)] when the conformational composition of two different dihedral angles of a pendant group with more than two chiral residues is tamed. Thus, while the dihedral angle at chiral residue 1 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;alanine], attached to the backbone, produces an extended or bent conformation in the pendant resulting in two scaffolds with different stretching degree, the second dihedral angle at chiral residue 2 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;methoxyphenylacetamide] places the substituents of this chiral center in a different spatial orientation, originating opposite helical senses at the polymer that are induced through a total control of the &#8220;chiral overpass effect&#8221;.

         <title>Phase Transitions in Chemically Fueled, Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling multiphase coacervate droplets to a chemical reaction cycle allows access to regimes inside the phase diagram not possible under thermodynamic control. Control over the stability, liquidity, and localization of the multiphases makes it a great synthetic platform to study the organization of membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Membraneless organelles are droplets in the cytosol that are regulated by chemical reactions. Increasing studies suggest that they are internally organized. However, how these subcompartments are regulated remains elusive. Herein, we describe a complex coacervate&#8208;based model composed of two polyanions and a short peptide. With a chemical reaction cycle, we control the affinity of the peptide for the polyelectrolytes leading to distinct regimes inside the phase diagram. We study the transitions from one regime to another and identify new transitions that can only occur under kinetic control. Finally, we show that the chemical reaction cycle controls the liquidity of the droplets offering insights into how active processes inside cells play an important role in tuning the liquid state of membraneless organelles. Our work demonstrates that not only thermodynamic properties but also kinetics should be considered in the organization of multiple phases in droplets.

         <title>Spatial Well&#8208;defined Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers with Single&#8208;Layer Thickness for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites, and monolayer characteristic of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction catalysts can decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The experimental and density functional theory simulation show that the relative position and local coordination environment have a significant effect on the cooperation between the metal centers.







Abstract
Innovative bimetallic materials provide more possibilities for further improving the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic catalysts because there is not a practical way to decouple the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of active sites from others, thus hindering in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism. Herein, we provide a rational design of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model OER catalyst. The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites and monolayer characteristic allow us to decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The results confirmed that the relative position and local coordination environment has significant effect on the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centres. The highest electrocatalytic activity with the turnover frequency value up to 26.19&#8197;s&#8722;1 was achieved at the overpotential of 500&#8197;mV.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Gold&#8208;Gold Wettability for Programmable Plasmonic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms. This oligo&#8208;A&#8208;based surface chemistry engineering method will enable controllable diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the nanoscopic surface to develop single&#8208;nanoparticle plasmonic devices for extreme nanophotonics and polariton chemistry.







Abstract
Controlling the deposition and diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on the surface of a solid material is vital for engineering the shape and function of nanocrystals. Here, we report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms to synthesize highly tunable plasmonic nanostructures. We find that the oligo&#8208;A attachment transforms the nanocrystal growth mode from the classical Frank&#8208;van der Merwe to the Volmer&#8208;Weber island growth. Finely tuning the oligo&#8208;A density can continuously change the gold&#8208;gold contact angle (&#952;) from 35.1&#177;3.6&#176; to 125.3&#177;8.0&#176;. We further demonstrate the versatility of this strategy for engineering nanoparticles with different curvature and dimensions. With this unconventional growth mode, we synthesize a sub&#8208;nanometer plasmonic cavity with a geometrical singularity when &#952;&gt;90&#176;. Superfocusing of light in this nanocavity produces a near&#8208;infrared intraparticle plasmonic coupling, which paves the way to surface engineering of single&#8208;particle plasmonic devices.

         <title>Engineering Enzyme Substrate Scope Complementarity for Promiscuous Cascade Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades can be used for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. A substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach was implemented to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase and a decarboxylase. The matched substrate scope of the enzymes was leveraged to produce a variety of enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are uniquely powerful for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. However, high substrate specificity can hinder the scope of biocatalytic cascades because the constituent enzymes may have non&#8208;complementary activity. In this study, we implemented a substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase (ObiH) and a decarboxylase for the production of chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. To generate a promiscuous cascade, we engineered a tryptophan decarboxylase to act efficiently on &#946;&#8208;OH amino acids while avoiding activity on l&#8208;threonine, which is needed for ObiH activity. We leveraged this exquisite selectivity with matched substrate scope to produce a variety of enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides. This demonstration shows how SUMS can be used to guide the development of promiscuous, C&#8722;C bond forming cascades.

         <title>An Unsaturated Bond Strategy to Regulate Active Centers of Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to modulate the charge distribution of active centers of organic catalysts by using unsaturated bonds (UBs) is reported. The UBs can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N group as active centers. The effect of UBs decoration on adsorption property of the catalysts is disclosed.







Abstract
Unsaturated environment is the key to affect catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unveiling the effect of unsaturated sites toward ORR activity is of importance due to the vague unsaturated states. Reported here is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy on the evaluation of unsaturated bonds (UBs) on adjacent carbon environment by precisely developing two metal&#8208;free vinyl&#8208;/azo&#8208;decorated covalent organic frameworks (Vinyl&#8208;COF and Azo&#8208;COF) as catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared UB&#8208;COFs exhibit good performance than the control Py&#8208;COF and comparable to the most reported carbon catalysts. Supported by theory calculations and in situ Raman spectra&#8208;electrochemistry, it is revealed that the UBs in organic catalysts can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N groups as active centers. Importantly, the intrinsic UBs can induce local charge redistribution, and make the molecular skeleton possess high isosurface map distribution, with an efficient affinity for oxygen intermediates.

         <title>19F Barcoding Enables Multiplex Detection of Biomarkers Associated with Organ Injury and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of molecular sensors with 19F barcodes enables multiplex detection of different biomarkers associated with organ injury and cancer. The barcoding strategy takes the advantage of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output and multiplex capacity.







Abstract
Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in complex environments is critical for the in&#8208;depth exploration of different biological processes, which is challenging for many current analytical methods due to various limitations. Herein, we report a strategy of 19F barcoding which takes the advantages of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output, and multiplex capacity. A set of 19F&#8208;barcoded sensors responding to different biomarkers involved in organ injury and cancer are designed, synthesized, and characterized. With these sensors, we accomplish concurrent assessment of different biomarkers in the samples collected from the mice with drug&#8208;induced liver/kidney injury or tumor, illustrating the feasibility of this approach for multiplexed detection of different biomarkers in complex environments during various biological processes.

         <title>Algorithmic Explorations of Unimolecular and Bimolecular Reaction Spaces
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>

An ultra&#8208;low cost reaction exploration algorithm (Yet Another Reaction Program, v2.0) is used to predict reaction outcomes and characterize multiple unimolecular and bimolecular reaction networks. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.







Abstract
Algorithmic reaction exploration based on transition state searches has already made inroads into many niche applications, but its potential as a general&#8208;purpose tool is still largely unrealized. Computational cost and the absence of benchmark problems involving larger molecules remain obstacles to further progress. Here an ultra&#8208;low cost exploration algorithm is implemented and used to explore the reactivity of unimolecular and bimolecular reactants, comprising a total of 581 reactions involving 51 distinct reactants. The algorithm discovers all established reaction pathways, where such comparisons are possible, while also revealing a much richer reactivity landscape, including lower barrier reaction pathways and a strong dependence of reaction conformation in the apparent barriers of the reported reactions. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.

         <title>From Local Covalent Bonding to Extended Electric Field Interactions in Proton Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy of hydrated proton complexes in solution provides compelling evidence of the pronounced impact on the electronic structure of the water molecules participating in the hydration, with a hierarchy in coupling strengths of the proton with profoundly strong orbital interactions for the inner three water molecules, and Coulombic field effects of the proton positive charge with the first hydration shell water molecules.







Abstract
Seemingly simple yet surprisingly difficult to probe, excess protons in water constitute complex quantum objects with strong interactions with the extended and dynamically changing hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of the liquid. Proton hydration plays pivotal roles in energy transport in hydrogen fuel cells and signal transduction in transmembrane proteins. While geometries and stoichiometry have been widely addressed in both experiment and theory, the electronic structure of these specific hydrated proton complexes has remained elusive. Here we show, layer by layer, how utilizing novel flatjet technology for accurate x&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements and combining infrared spectral analysis and calculations, we find orbital&#8208;specific markers that distinguish two main electronic&#8208;structure effects: Local orbital interactions determine covalent bonding between the proton and neigbouring water molecules, while orbital&#8208;energy shifts measure the strength of the extended electric field of the proton.

We report a method for direct enantioselective alkylation of 3&#8208;alkynoic acids and 2,3&#8208;alkendioic acids that form quaternary stereogenic centers, and application of this method to the total enantioselective synthesis of complex alkaloid (+)&#8208;goniomitine.

Abstract
We report a method for direct enantioselective alkylation of 3&#8208;alkynoic and 2,3&#8208;alkendioic acids that form quaternary stereogenic centers, and application of this method to the total enantioselective synthesis of a complex alkaloid (+)&#8208;goniomitine. The methods were effective in the alkylation of both 3&#8208;alkynoic acids, 2,3&#8208;alkendioic acids substrates with a broad range of heterocyclic and functionalized alkyl group substituents. Accompanying crystallographic studies provide mechanistic insight into the structure of well&#8208;defined chiral aggregates, highlighting cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between lithium and alkyne groups.

         <title>Tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane: An Isolable, Halogen&#8208;Free, Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottleable, halogen&#8208;free, neutral, single&#8208;site Lewis superacid, tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3) is synthesized in one pot from commercially available materials and its properties investigated. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane along with its lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO induces the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic C&#8722;F bond functionalizations indicate that BoCb3 is a promising Lewis acid catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3), a single site neutral Lewis superacid, in one pot from commercially available materials is achieved. The high fluoride ion affinity (FIA) confirms its classification as a Lewis superacid and the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method as well as adducts with Lewis bases indicate stronger Lewis acidity over the widely used fluorinated aryl boranes. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane and lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO rationalize the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic studies indicate that BoCb3 is a superior catalyst for promoting C&#8722;F bond functionalization reactions than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].

         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of aldimine esters with racemic allylic alcohols was enabled by cooperative catalysis. The Et3B additive plays a significant role in ionizing allylic alcohols to form electrophilic metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species and simultaneously promotes the formation of nucleophilic Cu&#8208;ylides. Computational mechanistic studies revealed the role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities.







Abstract
We describe cooperative bimetallic catalysis that enables regio&#8208;/stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylations of aldimine esters. By employing Et3B as the key activator, racemic allylic alcohols can be directly ionized to form Pd or Ir&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species in the presence of achiral Pd or chiral Ir complexes, respectively. The less or more substituted allylic termini of the metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species are amenable to nucleophilic attack by the chiral Cu&#8208;azomethine ylide, the formation of which is simultaneously facilitated by Et3B, affording &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high regioselectivity and excellent stereoselectivity. The use of readily available allylic alcohols as electrophilic precursors represents an improvement from an environmental and atom/step economy perspective. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities by analyzing steric effects, dispersion interactions, and frontier orbital population.

         <title>Facilitating Molecular Activation and Proton Feeding by Dual Active Sites on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;site synergism of vacant and protonated pyridine N in polymeric C3N4 significantly polarized the inert CO2 molecules and eliminates the formation energy barrier of key *COOH intermediates, inducing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity enhancement (183 times) in CO production. Our atomic&#8208;precision strategy offers a promising way to overcome the technical challenges in molecular activation and rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer during CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 provides an appealing way to alleviate the energy crisis and manage the global carbon balance but is limited by the high activation energy and the rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer. We now develop a dual&#8208;site strategy for high&#8208;efficiency CO2 conversion through polarizing CO2 molecules at pyridine N vacancies and accelerating the intermediate protonation by protonated pyridine N adjacent to nitrogen vacancies on polymeric carbon nitride. Our photocatalysts with atomic&#8208;level engineered active sites manifest a high CO production rate of 1835&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 183 times higher than the pristine bulk carbon nitride. Theoretical prediction and experimental studies confirm that such excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between vacant and protonated pyridine N in decreasing the formation energy of the key *COOH intermediates and the efficient electron transfer relay facilitated by the defect&#8208;induced shallow trap state and homogeneous charge mediators.

         <title>Kinetic Co&#8208;assembly Pathway Induced Chirality Inversion Along with Morphology Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the self&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF) is insensitive to the pathway followed, the co&#8208;assembly of LPF with naphthylamine derivatives is pathway&#8208;dependent. The helical nanofibers of LPF transform into diverse kinetically trapped chiral structures with opposite chirality through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway (pathway B), while only thermodynamically stable nonhelical structures are formed by the thermodynamic pathway (pathway&#8197;A).







Abstract
Kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway induced chirality inversion along with morphology transition is of importance to understand biological processes, but still remains a challenge to realize in artificial systems. Herein, helical nanofibers consisting of phenylalanine&#8208;based enantiomers (L/DPF) successfully transform into kinetically trapped architectures with opposite helicity through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway. By contrast, the co&#8208;assemblies obtained by a thermodynamic pathway exhibit non&#8208;helical structures. The formation sequence of non&#8208;covalent interactions plays a crucial role in structural chirality of co&#8208;assemblies. For the kinetic pathway, the hydrogen bonding between D/LPF and naphthylamide derivatives forms before &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking to facilitate the formation of helical structures with inverse handedness. This study may provide an approach to explore chirality inversion accompanied by morphology transition by manipulating the kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway.

         <title>Narrowband Emissive TADF Conjugated Polymers towards Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emissions are developed by attaching multiple resonance emitting moieties as pendants onto the polycarbazole backbone, and the resulting OLEDs achieve a maximum EQE of 17.5&#8201;% with FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) conjugated polymers usually show broad emission spectra due to the large structure relaxation, which is not desirable for high&#8208;quality organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. Herein, through attaching multiple resonance (MR) induced emitting moiety as pendant onto the polycarbazole backbone, TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emission are demonstrated. The obtained conjugated polymers exhibit typical TADF characteristics with narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 33&#8211;43&#8197;nm. The solution&#8208;processed devices employing these polymers as emissive layers realize excellent performances with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.5&#8201;%, emission peak at 496&#8197;nm and FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Asymmetric Cyclization of Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Substituted 1,6&#8208;Enynes for the Synthesis of Seletracetam</title>

         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes with boronic acids is achieved triggered by C(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation, which provides an expedient access to 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkably high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing groups into organic molecules can significantly affect their physical and chemical properties and has long been used as an effective strategy for drug discovery and development. Consequently, the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing heterocycles is highly desirable and sought after. Herein, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes, providing an expedient access to synthetically attractive 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkable high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee,&gt;35 examples). This protocol features readily available starting materials and excellent functional group compatibility, and exhibits complementary regioselectivity. The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.

         <title>Highly Selective Preparation and Depolymerization of Chemically Recyclable Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metal&#8208;free access to poly(cyclopentene carbonate) and its chemical recycling to monomer were achieved by using a dinuclear bifunctional organoboron catalyst, enriching the portfolio of the circular plastic economy.







Abstract
Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) (PCPC) produced by copolymerization of CO2 and cyclopentene oxide (CPO) is a promising but challenging chemical recyclable polymer that has high potential in minimizing plastic pollution and maximizing CO2 utilization. Currently, problems remain to be solved, include low reactivity of toxic metal catalysts, inevitable byproducts, and especially the ambiguous mechanism understanding. Herein, we present the first metal&#8208;free access to PCPC by using a series of modular dinuclear organoboron catalysts. PCPC was afforded in an unprecedented catalytic efficiency of 1.0&#8197;kg of PCPC/g of catalyst; while the depolymerization of PCPC abides by a combination pathway of random chain scission and chain unzipping, returning CPO in near&#8208;quantitative yield (&gt;99&#8201;%). The preparation and depolymerization of PCPC along with in depth understanding of related mechanisms would be helpful for further development of advanced catalysts and recyclable plastics.

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Economic Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis for High&#8208;Throughput RAFT Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic cascade catalysis consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been created for the high&#8208;throughput RAFT synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight polymers, under benchtop conditions at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) polymers by green approaches is highly desirable but remains unexplored. We report the creation of an atom&#8208;economic enzymatic cascade catalysis, consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), that enables high&#8208;throughput reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) synthesis of UHMW polymers at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L. FOx transforms formic acid, a C1 substrate, and oxygen to CO2 and H2O2, respectively. CO2 can escape from solution while H2O2 is harnessed in situ by HRP to generate radicals from acetylacetone for RAFT polymerization, leaving no waste accumulation in solution. Oxygen&#8208;tolerant RAFT polymerization using enzymatic cascade redox cycles was successfully performed in vials and 96&#8208;well plates to produce libraries of well&#8208;defined UHMW polymers, and represents the first example of high&#8208;throughput synthesis method of such materials at extremely low volumes.

         <title>Comprehensive Fragment Screening of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Proteome Explores Novel Chemical Space for Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a fragment&#8208;based screening strategy by NMR, we identified 311 small molecule binders of 25 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 proteins, thus expanding the previously unexplored chemical and target space. Further, using experimental and bioinformatic analysis we identify potential binding sites. This comprehensive data would greatly assist medicinal chemistry efforts even beyond COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (SCoV2) and its variants of concern pose serious challenges to the public health. The variants increased challenges to vaccines, thus necessitating for development of new intervention strategies including anti&#8208;virals. Within the international Covid19&#8208;NMR consortium, we have identified binders targeting the RNA genome of SCoV2. We established protocols for the production and NMR characterization of more than 80&#8201;% of all SCoV2 proteins. Here, we performed an NMR screening using a fragment library for binding to 25 SCoV2 proteins and identified hits also against previously unexplored SCoV2 proteins. Computational mapping was used to predict binding sites and identify functional moieties (chemotypes) of the ligands occupying these pockets. Striking consensus was observed between NMR&#8208;detected binding sites of the main protease and the computational procedure. Our investigation provides novel structural and chemical space for structure&#8208;based drug design against the SCoV2 proteome.

         <title>Engineering of Reversible NIR&#8208;II Redox&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Probes for Imaging of Inflammation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of trimethine skeleton NIR&#8208;II fluorophores (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) with improved stability over traditional heptamethine NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and emission above 1000&#8197;nm. The NIR&#8208;II Cy3s can reversibly respond to HClO and reactive sulfur species (RSS) and can serve as an effective platform for the reversible monitoring of the HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox process in a pathophysiology environment. Finally, we applied NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 to the reversible assessment of the redox environment and dynamic effect of drug treatment in an acute inflammation model and of redox potential changes during liver injury and repair.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent imaging shows great potential for deep tissue analysis at high resolution in living body owing to low background autofluorescence and photon scattering. However, reversible monitoring of redox homeostasis using NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate probes. In this study, a series of stable and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II dyes (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) were constructed based on trimethine skeleton. Significantly, introducing the 1,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;decahydroquinoxaline group to the NIR&#8208;II Cy3s not only effectively increased the wavelength, but also served as an effective response site for HClO, which can be restored by reactive sulfur species (RSS). Based on this, NIR&#8208;II Cy3s were used for reversible monitoring of HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox processes in the pathophysiology environment. Finally, NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 was successfully utilized for assessment of the redox environments and drug treatment effects in acute inflammation model.

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Biphenol&#8208;based Ultrathin Microporous Nanofilms for Highly Efficient Molecular Sieving Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin microporous polymer composite membranes with extraordinary perm&#8208;selectivity for organic solvent nanofiltration were fabricated by employing two novel 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives as IP monomers. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Moreover, it can achieve precise separation of organic molecules with similar molecular weights on their charge and molecular size.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is an emerging membrane separation technology, which urgently requires robust, easily processed, OSN membranes possessing high permeance and small solutes&#8208;selectivity to facilitate enhanced industrial uptake. Herein, we describe the use of two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives to fabricate hyper&#8208;crosslinked, microporous polymer nanofilms through IP. Ultra&#8208;thin, defect&#8208;free polyesteramide/polyester nanofilms (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) could be obtained readily due to the relatively large molecular size and ionized nature of the BIPOL monomers retarding the rate of the IP. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Specifically, the amino&#8208;BIPOL/PAN membrane exhibits extraordinary permselectivity performances with molecular weight cut&#8208;off as low as 233&#8197;Da and MeOH permeance of &#8776;13&#8197;LMH/bar. Precise separation of small dye mixtures with similar M.W. based on both their charge and molecular size are achieved.

         <title>Precise Control of Selenium Functionalization in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Two region&#8208;specific selenium&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors flanking conjugated side chains are compared with their sulfur&#8208;based analogue. mPh4F&#8208;TS with selenium at the outer positions show the most rigid skeleton, red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS organic solar cells exhibit the lowest energetic disorders, the highest charge carrier mobility and the best photon response, affording a top&#8208;ranking efficiency of &gt;18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Central &#960;&#8208;core engineering of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) is effective in boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Especially, selenium (Se) functionalization of NF&#8208;SMAs is considered a promising strategy but the structure&#8208;performance relationship remains unclear. Here, we synthesize two isomeric alkylphenyl&#8208;substituted selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs named mPh4F&#8208;TS and mPh4F&#8208;ST with different substitution positions, and contrast them with the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based analogue, mPh4F&#8208;TT. When placing Se atoms at the outer positions of the &#960;&#8208;core, mPh4F&#8208;TS shows the most red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact molecular stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS devices exhibit excellent absorption, high charge carrier mobility, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS achieves more balanced photovoltaic parameters and yields an efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%, which highlights that precisely manipulating selenium functionalization is a practicable way toward high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H Hydroxylation in Diiron &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylase CmlA Transpires by Amine&#8208;Assisted O2 Activation Avoiding FeIV2O2 Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM modeling revealed that the C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of L&#8208;PAPA in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires unprecedentedly through a traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation pathway. This novel O2 activation mode modulated by the L&#8208;PAPA substrate, which is associated with the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding, opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities in O2 activation by non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.







Abstract
Through QM/MM modeling, we discovered that C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires by traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation. Different from the canonical diiron hydroxylase sMMO, this aliphatic&#8208;amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation avoids generating the high&#8208;valent diferryl FeIV2O2 species, but alternatively renders a diferric FeIII2O species as the reactive oxidant. From this unprecedented O2 activation mode, the derived C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation mechanism in CmlA also differs drastically from the toluene aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase T4MO. This substrate&#8208;modulated O2 activation in CmlA has rich mechanistic implications for other diiron hydroxylases with an amine group adjacent to the C&#8722;H bond under hydroxylation in substrates, such as hDOHH. Furthermore, the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding in CmlA opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities for O2 activation in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.

         <title>Reversible Light&#8208;Controlled CO Adsorption via Tuning &#960;&#8208;Complexation of Cu+ Sites in Azobenzene&#8208;Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart adsorbents are fabricated by introducing Cu+ into azobenzene&#8208;decorated metal&#8208;organic frameworks, in which azobenzene acts as light&#8208;responsive motifs and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexing sites. Ultraviolet&#8208;/visible&#8208;light irradiation triggers the isomerization of azobenzene, causing the changes in electrostatic potential around Cu+. This exposure/shelter effect adjusts CO capture and release by shifting light.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive adsorbents capture significant attention due to their tailorable performance upon light irradiation. The modulation of such adsorbents is mainly based on weak (physical) interactions caused by steric hindrance while tuning strong interaction with target adsorbates is scarce. Here we report smart &#960;&#8208;complexation adsorbents, which can adjust the &#960;&#8208;complexation of active sites via light irradiation. A typical metal&#8208;organic framework, MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2, was decorated with azobenzene motifs, and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexation active sites were introduced subsequently. The reversible light&#8208;induced isomerization of azobenzene regulates the surface electrostatic potentials around Cu+ from &#8722;0.038 to 0.008&#8197;eV, causing shielding and exposure effects. The alteration of CO uptake is achieved up to 54&#8201;% via changing light, while that on MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 is negligible. This study provides a clue for designing target&#8208;specific smart materials to meet the practical stimuli&#8208;responsive adsorption demands.

         <title>A Universal Photoactivatable Tag Attached to Fluorophores Enables Their Use for Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general strategy for constructing photoactivatable probes by introducing a universal tag SO on fluorescent molecules. This strategy is applicable to most of the commercial fluorophores with various skeletal structures. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubules in fixed neurons.







Abstract
Single molecule localization microscopy based on photoactivation is a powerful tool for investigating the ultrastructure of cells. We developed a general strategy for photoactivatable fluorophores, using 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxathiine group (SO) as a tag to attach to various skeletal structures, including coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, and cyanine. The conjugation of SO resulted in a significant loss of fluorescence due to photoinduced electron transfer (PeT). Under the irradiation of excitation light, singlet oxygen generated by the fluorophores converted the SO moiety into its ester derivative, terminated the PeT process, and restored the fluorescence. Single molecule localization imaging was achieved using a dual functional illuminating beam in the visible, acting as both the activating and the exciting source. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubule structures in neurons.

         <title>Catalytic Multicomponent Synthesis of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Consecutive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive nickel catalysis was leveraged to orchestrate the multicomponent union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and isobutyl chloroformate to assemble C&#8208;acyl glycosides in high anomeric selectivities. Computational studies provided insights that rationalize the origin of the high chemoselectivity. The method is applicable to the synthesis of complex C&#8208;linked disaccharides and late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of peptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Acyl glycosides are versatile intermediates to natural products and medicinally relevant entities. Conventional cross&#8208;coupling strategies to secure these molecules often relied on two&#8208;component manifolds in which a glycosyl precursor is coupled with an acyl donor (pre&#8208;synthesized or generated in situ) under transition metal or dual catalysis to forge a C&#8722;C bond. Here, we disclose a three&#8208;component Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive regime that facilitates the chemoselective union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and commercially available isobutyl chloroformate as a CO surrogate. The method tolerates multiple functionalities and the resulting products are obtained in high diastereoselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide a mechanistic rationale for the unexpectedly high chemoselectivity of sequential cross&#8208;electrophile couplings. This approach enables the expeditious assembly of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize C&#8208;acyl glycosides, as well as late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of oligopeptides.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Assembly of MOFs Colloidosomes for Bubble&#8208;Propelled Micromotors and Stirring&#8208;Free Environmental Remediation</title>

         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward strategy is designed to efficiently self&#8208;assemble MOF nanoparticles into robust MOFtors based on the Pickering emulsion. Such MOFtors are capable of enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring.







Abstract
The design of MOF&#8208;based micromotors (MOFtors) is still challenging and with limited approaches, especially for the MOF nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we report a universal and straightforward strategy to efficiently self&#8208;assembly MOF NPs into robust MOFtors for enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring. Based on the transient Pickering emulsion method, Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (Fe&#8208;UiO) NPs are rapidly self&#8208;assembled into Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 colloidosomes (Fe&#8208;UiOSomes) on a large scale, and the formation mechanism is systematically studied. The Fe&#8208;UiOSomes&#8208;Pt micromotors through chemical reduction (Micromotor&#8208;C) presented a higher motility of 450&#177;180&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 in a 5&#8197;wt% H2O2 aqueous solution. Finally, the bubble&#8208;propelled Micromotor&#8208;C was employed to efficiently remove dyes and heavy metal ions (94&#8201;% for MO and 91&#8201;% for CrVI).

         <title>Thiolated, Reduced Palladium Nanoclusters with Resolved Structures for the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first atomically monodisperse thiolated Pd nanocluster is obtained. It has a +6 charged di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged &#956;&#8208;6 interstitial B atom. The as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and the commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Although thiolated, reduced Group 11 metal nanoclusters with atomic monodispersity have been repeatedly reported in the past decade, their Pd analogues have not been reported thus far. In this work, we provide a resolution for the challenging synthesis and obtain for the first time an atomically monodisperse thiolated, reduced Pd (q=+0.75) nanocluster with a di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged interstitial B atom, as revealed by ESI&#8208;MS, SCXRD, etc. &#956;&#8208;6 B is found for the first time in Group 10 and 11 metal nanoclusters. More importantly, the as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and even a commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), having significant implications for the influence of the metal charge state and space structure on the catalytic activity.

         <title>Intraligand Charge Transfer Enables Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions without exogenous photocatalysts were realized using a nickel catalyst that was activated through intraligand charge transfer. Ligand polymerization afforded a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.







Abstract
We demonstrate that several visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out using a photoactive NiII precatalyst that forms in situ from a nickel salt and a bipyridine ligand decorated with two carbazole groups (Ni(Czbpy)Cl2). The activation of this precatalyst towards cross&#8208;coupling reactions follows a hitherto undisclosed mechanism that is different from previously reported light&#8208;responsive nickel complexes that undergo metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that irradiation of Ni(Czbpy)Cl2 with visible light causes an initial intraligand charge transfer event that triggers productive catalysis. Ligand polymerization affords a porous, recyclable organic polymer for heterogeneous nickel catalysis of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The heterogeneous catalyst shows stable performance in a packed&#8208;bed flow reactor during a week of continuous operation.

         <title>Regioisomer&#8208;Free Difluoro&#8208;Monochloro Terminal&#8208;based Hexa&#8208;Halogenated Acceptor with Optimized Crystal Packing for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New fluorine/chlorine regio&#8208;regular hetero&#8208;trihalogenated terminal was firstly synthesized and systematically employed to enhance single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance of the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.65&#8201;%, which is far better than that of Y&#8208;Cl and Y&#8208;FCl and is the highest efficiency for the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs.







Abstract
Herein, we synthesized new hetero&#8208;halogenated end groups with well&#8208;determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (o&#8208;FCl&#8208;IC and FClF&#8208;IC), and synthesized regioisomer&#8208;free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y&#8208;Cl, Y&#8208;FCl, and Y&#8208;FClF with distinct hetero&#8208;halogenated terminals, respectively. The single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y&#8208;FClF exhibits more compact three&#8208;dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y&#8208;FCl. From Y&#8208;Cl to Y&#8208;FCl to Y&#8208;FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical band gap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films. Overall, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.65&#8201;%, outperforming the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FCl and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;Cl, which is the best PCE for reported hetero&#8208;halogens&#8208;based SMAs in binary OSCs.

     alt="Regioisomer-Free Difluoro-Monochloro Terminal-based Hexa-Halogenated Acceptor with Optimized Crystal Packing for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New fluorine/chlorine regio-regular hetero-trihalogenated terminal was firstly synthesized and systematically employed to enhance single-crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance of the hetero-halogenated SMAs. The &lt;b&gt;PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y-FClF&lt;/b&gt; achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.65&#8201;%, which is far better than that of &lt;b&gt;Y-Cl&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Y-FCl&lt;/b&gt; and is the highest efficiency for the hetero-halogenated SMAs-based binary OSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we synthesized new hetero-halogenated end groups with well-determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-FCl-IC and FClF-IC), and synthesized regioisomer-free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y-Cl, Y-FCl, and Y-FClF with distinct hetero-halogenated terminals, respectively. The single-crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y-FClF exhibits more compact three-dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;-&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y-FCl. From Y-Cl to Y-FCl to Y-FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical band gap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y-FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face-on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films. Overall, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y-FClF organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.65&#8201;%, outperforming the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y-FCl and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y-Cl, which is the best PCE for reported hetero-halogens-based SMAs in binary OSCs. Our results demonstrate that difluoro-monochloro hetero-terminal is a superior regio-regular unit for enhancing the intermolecular crystal packing and photovoltaic performance of hetero-halogenated SMAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Soellner published on the interplay between allosteric and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;competitive inhibitors of ABL kinase, showing that the latter preferably binds to different conformational states of ABL compared to allosteric agents that specifically target the ABL myristate pocket (STAMP) and deducing that asciminib cannot bind to ABL simultaneously with ATP&#8208;competitive drugs. These results are to some extent in line with ours, although our analyses of dose&#8211;response matrices from combinations of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib, show neither synergy nor antagonism, but suggest additive antiproliferative effects on BCR&#8208;ABL&#8208;dependent KCL22 cells. Furthermore, our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that asciminib can bind ABL concomitantly with type&#8208;1 or &#8208;2 ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors to form ternary complexes. Concomitant binding of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib might translate to benefit some chronic myeloid leukaemia patients.

Abstract
Manley and co&#8208;workers provide data demonstrating that, at super&#8208;pharmacological concentrations (300&#8197;&#956;M), a ternary complex between Abl, asciminib, and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors is possible. The work in our manuscript concerns the interplay of asciminib (and GNF&#8208;2) with ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (Cmax=1.6&#8211;3.7&#8197;&#956;M for asciminib). Manley and co&#8208;workers do not question any of the studies that we reported, nor do they provide explanations for how our work fits into their preferred model. Herein, we consider the data presented by Manley and co&#8208;workers. In addition, we provide new data supporting the findings in our Communication. Asciminib and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors do not simultaneously bind Abl at pharmacologically relevant concentrations unless the conformation selectivity for both ligands is matched.

How far does the influence of a proton reach in water? X&#8208;ray spectroscopy reveals how&#8211;&#8211;layer by layer&#8211;&#8211;the electronic structure of water molecules is altered when hydrating a proton. A general architectural hierarchy exists in which the proton strongly interacts with the three nearest water molecules to form a hybridized H7O3+ core while the first hydration shell is affected by the electric field of the proton's positive charge. Further solvation shells contain bulk&#8208;like water molecules, as reported by Ehud Pines, Philippe Wernet, Michael Odelius, Erik&#8197;T.&#8197;J. Nibbering, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202211066).

Thermoresponsive polymers undergo phase separation in response to changes in temperature. In their Communication (e202209530), Simon Harrisson, Colin Bonduelle, and co&#8208;workers present the use of synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibiting temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometers.

Spectral tuning , from green to red, of luciferin's electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is achieved by electrolyte engineering, demonstrating that this does not require a keto/enol isomerization of the light emitter. Visual mapping of luciferin's ECL enables a straightforward optical measurement of superoxide diffusivity, as described by Michelle&#8197;L. Coote, Marco Garavelli, Simone Ciampi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202209670).

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes recent advances regarding the preparation of complex and stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules by routes originating from purchasable or readily accessible alkenyl and allylic fluorides. The untapped potential of other, far less explored, commercially available organofluorine compounds as launching points for the development of stereoselective processes that may be valuable to drug discovery is underscored.







Abstract
Stereochemically defined organofluorine compounds are vital to drug discovery and many applicable catalytic strategies have been introduced for accessing these entities stereoselectively. One approach entails incorporation of a fluorine atom (C&#8722;F bond formation) or an organofluorine moiety (e.g., CF3 or CF2H), and another exploits commercially available compounds with one or more fluorine atoms. Here, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regarding the use of alkenyl and allylic fluorides in preparation of stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules. Allylic and alkenyl fluorides may be purchased or generated from a commercially available acid, carboxylate salt, ester, aldehyde hydrate, or ketone bearing several fluorine atoms next to a carbonyl group. We underscore the untapped potential of purchasable organofluorine compounds, many allylic and alkenyl fluorides, as launching points for development of stereoselective processes that are of value to therapeutic science.

Efforts to deepen the understanding of sustainable development have resulted in the concept of green carbon science. In this Review, technological achievements in green carbon science are discussed, with a focus on pilot testing, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.







Abstract
The concept of green carbon science is to promote the goal of achieving carbon neutrality, the importance and urgency of which have been well&#8208;recognized and received worldwide attention. Carbon neutrality has become the focus of research work in many fields, and correspondingly, a growing number of papers and publications have been published over the last few years. However, since carbon neutralization is a real problem that urgently requires technical solutions, the transition from fundamental research to practical applications must be accelerated. A number of research teams are bold in putting things into practice and blazing new trails. This Review summarizes the recent technological developments within the framework of green carbon science, focusing on conducted pilot tests, industrial demonstrations, and commercial applications beyond the laboratory stage.

         <title>Challenges and Prospects in the Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>

This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the production of HCHO from CO2, including chemical catalysis (hydrogenation using H2 and hydroboration/hydrosilylation), photo/electrocatalysis, and biocatalysis (enzymatic reduction). From analysis of advantages and deficits of each methodology, we present viewpoints and potential strategies for optimizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion.







Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a crucial C1 building block for daily&#8208;life commodities in a wide range of industrial processes. Industrial production of HCHO today is based on energy&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive gas&#8208;phase catalytic oxidation of methanol, which calls for exploring other and more sustainable ways of carrying out this process. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as precursor presents a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate the carbon footprint and alleviate environmental issues. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.

         <title>Total Syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;Dracocephalone A and (&#177;)&#8208;Dracocequinones A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;dracocephalone A (1) and (&#177;)&#8208;dracocequinones A (4) and B (5). An initially&#8208;envisioned intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder strategy guided the evolution of a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization approach that allowed for access to the carbocyclic core of 1. Further advancement by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations and rearrangements allowed for conversion to 1, 4, and 5.







Abstract
Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)&#8208;dracocephalone A (1) and (&#177;)&#8208;dracocequinones A (4) and B (5). The synthesis was initially envisioned as proceeding through an intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a strategy that eventually evolved into a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization. This highly diastereoselective transformation set the stage for trans&#8208;decalin formation and a late&#8208;stage Su&#225;rez oxidation that produced a [3.2.1] oxabicycle suited for conversion to 1. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated aromatization, followed by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations, allowed for rearrangement to a [2.2.2] oxabicycle poised for conversion to 4 and 5.

&lt;p&gt;Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)-dracocephalone A (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and (&#177;)-dracocequinones A (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and B (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). An initially-envisioned intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder strategy guided the evolution of a Lewis acid-promoted spirocyclization approach that allowed for access to the carbocyclic core of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Further advancement by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations and rearrangements allowed for conversion to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Described herein are the first total syntheses of (&#177;)-dracocephalone A (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and (&#177;)-dracocequinones A (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and B (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). The synthesis was initially envisioned as proceeding through an intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a strategy that eventually evolved into a Lewis acid-promoted spirocyclization. This highly diastereoselective transformation set the stage for &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-decalin formation and a late-stage Su&#225;rez oxidation that produced a [3.2.1] oxabicycle suited for conversion to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Br&#248;nsted acid-mediated aromatization, followed by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations, allowed for rearrangement to a [2.2.2] oxabicycle poised for conversion to &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Exhaustive Reduction of Oxo&#8208;Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system involving titanium used for the exhaustive reduction of carboxylic acid derivatives to the corresponding methyl compounds is reported. The catalytic system also works with other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates while the products might be promising for bio&#8208;applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the in situ generated TiIII&#8722;H species was key for this transformation.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of carboxylic acids and derivatives all the way to their corresponding methyl&#8208;compounds is very rare and still challenging for homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report an unprecedented and general catalytic exhaustive reduction of carboxylic functional group straightforwardly to a methyl group. This reaction was achieved using earth&#8208;abundant and readily available titanium as a catalyst. Our system has broad functional group tolerance and works for various other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the in situ&#8208;generated TiIII&#8722;H species was vital for this transformation.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Assisted Click&#8208;Chemistry for Proximity&#8208;Driven, Site&#8208;Specific Acetylation of Histones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a proximity&#8208;driven, lysine&#8208;specific acetylation approach to construct precisely acetylated histone proteins. The approach is facilitated by a click reagent equipped with an acetate group donor to acetylate a nearby lysine in a sequence&#8208;controlled manner.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of histones are essential in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. Among these modifications, lysine acetylation is one of the most established. Earlier studies relied on the use of chromatin containing heterogeneous mixtures of histones acetylated at multiple sites. Differentiating the individual contribution of single acetylation events towards chromatin regulation is thus of great relevance. However, it is difficult to access homogeneous samples of histones, with a single acetylation, in sufficient quantities for such studies. By engineering histone H3 with a cysteine in proximity of the lysine of interest, we demonstrate that conjugation with maleimide&#8208;DBCO followed by a strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction results in the acetylation of a single lysine in a controlled, site&#8208;specific manner. The chemical precision offered by our click&#8208;to&#8208;acetylate approach will facilitate access to and the study of acetylated histones.

         <title>Photochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H Pyridination via Arene&#8211;Pyridinium Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leverage the photoexcitation of arene&#8211;pyridinium electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes to achieve C(sp2)&#8722;H pyridination. Black light irradiation of the simple combination of arene substrate, pyridine, acid (to generate a pyridinium acceptor in situ), and O2 (terminal oxidant) affords N&#8208;arylpyridinium products. This transformation proceeds without an exogenous photocatalyst, complementing prior photochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H amination methods.







Abstract
This report describes the development of a photochemical method for C(sp2)&#8722;H pyridination that leverages the photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental and DFT studies show that black light (&#955;max&#8776;350&#8197;nm) irradiation of solutions of protonated pyridines (acceptors) and aromatic C&#8722;H substrates (donors) results in single electron transfer to form aryl radical cation intermediates that can be trapped with pyridine nucleophiles under aerobic conditions. With some modification of the reaction conditions, this EDA activation mode is also effective for promoting the oxidatively triggered SNAr pyridination of aryl halides. Overall, this report represents an inexpensive and atom&#8208;economical approach to photochemical pyridination reactions that eliminates the requirement of an exogenous photocatalyst.

         <title>Design of Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts for Direct Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical composition of frustrated Lewis pairs is mapped to their performance in catalytic direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formate using linear scaling relationships. This map highlights the need for appropriately balancing the acidity and basicity of the components for enhanced activity, which led to the demonstration of hitherto unreported catalytic turnover for this transformation.







Abstract
Despite recent progress in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), direct FLP&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 remains elusive. From a near&#8208;infinite array of plausible Lewis pairs, it is challenging to identify individual combinations that are appropriate for catalyzing this reaction. To this end, we propose a mapping of the chemical composition of FLPs to their activity towards direct catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into formate. The maps, built upon linear scaling relationships, pinpoint specific FLP combinations with the proper complementary acidity and basicity to optimally balance the energetics of the catalytic cycle. One such combination was experimentally validated to achieve hitherto unreported catalytic turnover for this transformation.

         <title>Arylboration of Enecarbamates for the Synthesis of Borylated Saturated N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated N&#8208;heterocycles are important motifs found in many biologically active molecules. In this work, difunctionalization of 4&#8211;7&#8208;membered enecarbamates is achieved using both Cu/Pd and Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good selectivity. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Two catalytic systems have been developed for the arylboration of endocyclic enecarbamates to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. A Cu/Pd dual catalytic reaction enables the synthesis of borylated, &#945;&#8208;arylated azetidines, while a Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration reaction efficiently functionalizes 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered enecarbamates. In the case of the Cu/Pd&#8208;system, a remarkable additive effect was identified that allowed for broader scope. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Saturated N-heterocycles are important motifs found in many biologically active molecules. In this work, difunctionalization of 4&#8211;7-membered enecarbamates is achieved using both Cu/Pd and Ni-catalysed arylboration to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N-heterocycles in good selectivity. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Stable and Red&#8208;Emissive Radical Cation for Mutp53 Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive radical cation P.+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn was developed for mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of zinc ions to promote degradation of mutp53 in cancer cells via proteasome&#8208;dependent pathway and facilitate abrogation of various mutp53&#8208;conferred gain of function phenotypes.







Abstract
Compared with conventional closed&#8208;shell fluorophores, radical cations provide an opportunity for development of red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with small sizes and easy preparation. However, most radical cations reported in the literature suffer from poor stability in water solution and are almost non&#8208;emissive. To tackle this challenge, we herein develop a deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive and water&#8208;stable pyrrole radical cation P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn, which can be easily generated from P&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn by air oxidation. The deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn can be used for imaging&#8208;guided mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of Zn2+ into cancer cells to promote mutant p53 proteins degradation and abrogate mutp53&#8208;manifested gain of function, including reduced chemotherapy resistance, inhibited cancer cell migration, decreased tumor cell colony and sphere formation. The water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red emissive pyrrole radical cation is thus promising for cancer theranostic applications.

         <title>A Synthetic Cycle for Heteroarene Synthesis by Nitride Insertion
</title>

An osmium nitride is shown to insert nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. A synthetic cycle to regenerate the starting nitride is presented alongside mechanistic studies of each step.







Abstract
Recent interest in skeletal editing necessitates the continued development of reagent classes with the ability to transfer single atoms. Terminal transition metal nitrides hold immense promise for single&#8208;atom transfer, though their use in organic synthesis has so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a synthetic cycle with associated detailed mechanistic studies that primes the development of terminal transition metal nitrides as valuable single&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Specifically, we show [cis&#8208;terpyOsNCl2]PF6 inserts nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. Mechanistic studies for each step (insertion, aromatization, product release, and nitride regeneration) are reported, including crystallographic characterization of diverted intermediates, kinetics, and computational studies. The mechanistic foundation set by this synthetic cycle opens the door to the further development of nitrogen insertion heteroarene syntheses promoted by late transition metal nitrides.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Boroaminomethylation of Olefins to &#947;&#8208;Boryl Amines with CO as C1 Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as &#8722;CH2&#8208;source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond was described. In the present of CuCl and Xantphos as the catalyst, a variety of &#947;&#8208;boryl amines were obtained with broad functional groups tolerance. The new aromatization and other transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrate their utility. Notably, 13C labeled product was produced with isotope&#8208;labeled 13CO.







Abstract
Boroaminomethylation of olefins is an efficient process to convert hydrocarbons directly into boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Such chemicals are a good handle for obtaining more complexed amine derivatives through the various transformations of organoboron. However, using simple and easily available CO as the C1 feedstock to achieve boroaminomethylation is still elusive. Here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as the C1 source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond. This method affords valuable &#947;&#8208;boryl amines from four inexpensive readily chemicals. The wide synthetic transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrates their utility. Notably, 13C labeling studies revealed that the &#8722;CH2&#8208;building block was derived from one molecule of CO.

         <dc:description>
Synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibit temperature driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.







Abstract
We report that synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibit temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior is robust and governed by the chirality of the proline units. It paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as a simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Hydride&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes has been developed for rapid synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reaction is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild conditions, and having excellent functional group tolerance. Concise asymmetric synthesis of antidepressant drug, D&#8208;Milnacipran, was performed to demonstrate the synthetic usefulness.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are structural motifs that are widely present in natural products and bioactive molecules, and they are also tremendously useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane derivatives has been an intensively researched area over the years, but efficient asymmetric preparation of alkylcyclopropane scaffolds remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and diastereoselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes for facile synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reported method is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild reaction conditions, and having broad applicability and excellent functional group tolerance.

     alt="Nickel-Hydride-Catalyzed Diastereo- and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first nickel-hydride-catalyzed diastereo- and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes has been developed for rapid synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reaction is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild conditions, and having excellent functional group tolerance. Concise asymmetric synthesis of antidepressant drug, D-Milnacipran, was performed to demonstrate the synthetic usefulness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclopropanes are structural motifs that are widely present in natural products and bioactive molecules, and they are also tremendously useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane derivatives has been an intensively researched area over the years, but efficient asymmetric preparation of alkylcyclopropane scaffolds remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report a nickel-hydride-catalyzed enantioselective and diastereoselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes for facile synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reported method is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild reaction conditions, and having broad applicability and excellent functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulation&#8208;Guided Design of a Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Radiotherapy&#8208;Radiodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
After demonstrating the potential of Th&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (nMOF) as excellent radiosensitizer with Monte Carlo simulations, we designed Th&#8208;DBP nMOF with Th6 secondary building units and DBP photosensitizers for efficient radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy. Th&#8208;DBP greatly enhanced hydroxyl radical and 1O2 generation upon irradiation to kill cancer cells and regress colon and pancreatic cancers in mice models.







Abstract
High&#8208;Z metal&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) with photosensitizing ligands can enhance radiation damage to tumors via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy (RT&#8208;RDT) process. Here we report Monte Carlo (MC) simulation&#8208;guided design of a Th&#8208;based nMOF built from Th6&#8208;oxo secondary building units and 5,15&#8208;di(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (DBP) ligands, Th&#8208;DBP, for enhanced RT&#8208;RDT. MC simulations revealed that the Th&#8208;lattice outperformed the Hf&#8208;lattice in radiation dose enhancement owing to its higher mass attenuation coefficient. Upon X&#8208;ray or &#947;&#8208;ray radiation, Th&#8208;DBP enhanced energy deposition, generated more reactive oxygen species, and induced significantly higher cytotoxicity to cancer cells over the previously reported Hf&#8208;DBP nMOF. With low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, Th&#8208;DBP suppressed tumor growth by 88&#8201;% in a colon cancer and 97&#8201;% in a pancreatic cancer mouse model.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell ZnO@Microporous Organic Polymer Nanospheres as Enhanced Piezo&#8208;Triboelectric Energy Harvesting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric ZnO core&#8208;triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP) shell nanoparticles showed enhanced small energy harvesting performance, compared with ZnO and MOP. The piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerator (PTENG) with the optimized 7&#8197;wt&#8201;% ZnO@MOP/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) film showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Core&#8208;shell nanospheres were prepared by the homogeneous coating of piezoelectric ZnO nanorod aggregates with triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP). The small energy harvesting performance of ZnO@MOP was significantly enhanced, compared with those of ZnO and MOP, due to the piezoelectrification&#8208;induced polarization of inner ZnO and the enhanced generation of tribopositive charges of MOP. Piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerators (PTENGs) fabricated with ZnO@MOP showed peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, the PTENGs showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles, demonstrating as efficient power sources for charging electrolytic capacitors and for operating 200 green light emitting diode bulbs.

After many years of being invoked as an intermediate, the existence of PhI(OTf)2 was recently disproven. Taking advantage of a nitro substituent that suppresses decomposition; an NO2&#8208;PhI(OTf)2 molecule has been synthesized and structurally characterized.







Abstract
PhI(OTf)2 and related ArI(OTf)2 species have been incorrectly invoked as intermediates in oxidation reactions for many years. We recently established that such compounds did not yet exist but remain an attractive target. Here we describe the synthesis, isolation, and structural characterization of NO2&#8208;PhI(OTf)2, which is resistant to decomposition and more reactive than PhI(OTf)(OAc), the species previously misidentified as PhI(OTf)2.

         <title>Perfectly Isotactic Polypropylene upon In Situ Activation of Ultrarigid meso Hafnocenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ activation, hafnocene meso&#8208;I yields isotactic polypropylene instead of atactic polypropylene of meso&#8208;I and rac&#8208;I. With our easy and convenient isomerization and polymerization protocol, productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers are accessible.







Abstract
For more than 40&#8197;years, the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric indenyl&#8208;based racemic metallocenes for the isoselective polymerization of propylene relied on a tedious separation of the produced rac and meso isomers. Status quo, latter are considered wasteful as they produce atactic polypropylene (aPP) rather than isotactic polypropylene (iPP) if activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Unexpectedly, the in situ activation of meso hafnocene I yielded perfectly isotactic polypropylene. We verified an isomerization of the meso compound to the corresponding racemic one upon triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) addition via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and established an easy and convenient polymerization protocol, enabling productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers. With this established isomerization protocol, the potential yield of iPP was enhanced by more than 400&#8201;%. This protocol was also shown to be applicable to other meso hafnocenes and some initial mechanistic insights were received.

         <title>A Topology&#8208;Defined Polyester Elastomer from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: A One&#8208;Pot&#8208;One&#8208;Step &#8220;Scrambling Polymerizations&#8221; Strategy</title>

A novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is realized to produce polyester with tunable topologies by one&#8208;pot&#8208;one&#8208;step ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of a substituted &#948;&#8208;lactone derived from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;butadiene with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone mediated by sodium phenolate. The obtained transparent, non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable network presents great resilience and excellent elastic recovery properties for application as a polyester elastomer.







Abstract
It is significant and challenging to use CO2 to produce polymeric materials, especially with olefins. Here, a novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is designed and performed for the copolymerization of a CO2&#8208;and&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;derived valerolactone, 3&#8208;ethylidene&#8208;6&#8208;vinyltetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (EVL), with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) to prepare polyesters. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting in polyester P(CL&#8208;co&#8208;EVL) with a tunable topology and composition. The non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break of &gt;600&#8201;% can be used as an elastomer. We propose a method to provide polyester elastomers from CO2 and olefins for the first time, and expand the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Transient Chirality Transfer and Atroposelective C&#8208;H Functionalization to Access Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed via catalytic transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer strategy. More importantly, this annulation represents a rare example of construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through tandem PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation process.







Abstract
Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization and Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of PdII&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.

         <title>Structure of the (Bi)carbonate Adlayer on Cu(100) Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular&#8208;scale structure of the interface between copper electrodes and bicarbonate electrolyte, a key system for electrochemical CO2 reduction, is clarified by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, revealing two highly complex coexisting adlayer structures above a critical potential. Ab initio calculations identify these as carbonate/water coadsorbate layers and indicate a strongly stabilizing effect of the adjacent liquid solution.







Abstract
(Bi)carbonate adsorption on Cu(100) in 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 has been studied by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy. Coexistence of different ordered adlayer phases with (
&#215;6
)R45&#176; and (4&#215;4) unit cells was observed in the double layer potential regime. The adlayer is rather dynamic and undergoes a reversible order&#8208;disorder phase transition at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional calculations indicate that the adlayer consists of coadsorbed carbonate and water molecules and is strongly stabilized by liquid water in the adjacent electrolyte.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Pyritide A2 through Pyridine Ring Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide pyritide A2 is reported. Inspired by biosynthesis, which proceeds through cycloaddition of post&#8208;translationally modified peptides, the described approach features rapid synthesis of a trisubstituted pyridine directly from a simple amino acid precursor. This strategy proved general for the preparation of different pyridines associated with this class of natural products.







Abstract
Pyritides belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide class of natural products that were recently genome&#8208;predicted and are structurally defined by unique pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycles. Inspired by their biosynthesis, proceeding through peptide modification and cycloaddition to form the heterocyclic core, we report the chemical synthesis of pyritide A2 involving pyridine ring synthesis from an amino acid precursor through aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. This strategy permitted the preparation of the decorated pyridine core with an appended amino acid residue in two steps from a commercially available arginine derivative and secured pyritide A2 in ten steps. Moreover, the synthetic logic enables efficient preparation of different pyridine subunits associated with pyritides, allowing rapid and convergent access to this new class of natural products and analogues thereof.

         <title>Direct Observation of &#8220;Elongated&#8221; Conformational States in &#945;&#8208;Synuclein upon Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 46, November 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a modified cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive Pairing StatisticS), we unravel conformational changes of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein upon liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). The conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states in liquid droplets. During this early LLPS stage, &#945;&#8208;synuclein remains monomeric and highly flexible.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), fibrillation, and forms insoluble intracellular Lewy bodies in neurons, which are the hallmark of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Neurotoxicity precedes the formation of aggregates and might be related to &#945;&#8208;syn LLPS. The molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of LLPS are still elusive. To obtain structural insights into &#945;&#8208;syn upon LLPS, we take advantage of cross&#8208;linking/mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) and introduce an innovative approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive PAiring StatisticS). In this work, we show that the conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;syn shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states upon LLPS. We obtain insights into the critical initial stages of LLPS and establish a novel mass spectrometry&#8208;based approach that will aid to solve open questions in LLPS structural biology.
