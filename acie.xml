         <title>Stacking Cyclophanes into Microcrystalline Chiral Vases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering novel micro&#8208;/nanoscale systems and devices based on the supramolecular assembly have tremendous potential from a diverse applications perspective; however, controlling the size, shape, spatial arrangements, and hierarchical transcription by a dimensional organizing principle without the help of templates remains a challenging task. In this vein, a recent study by Oki and colleagues on stacking chiral cyclophane via intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions to craft synchronous microcrystalline 3D chiral vessels with controlled conformational arrangements represents a truly remarkable illustration of molecular engineering. The microvessels bear stereocontrolled skeletal morphology, recognize stereoisomers and serve as containers to accommodate microcrystals, polymer particles, and fluorescent dyes. The full application scope of this fascinating research is far beyond non&#8208;covalent interactions, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, and crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bioctacene&#8208;Incorporated Nanographene with Near&#8208;Infrared Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a hexabenzoperihexacene (HBPH) with two incorporated octacene substructures, which was unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, revealing its nonplanar structure in a racemic mixture. The theoretical isomerization barrier of the (P,P)&#8208;/(P,M)&#8208;forms&#160;was estimated to be 38.4 kcal/mol, and resolution was achieved by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Notably, the enantiomers exhibited opposite circular dichroism responses&#160;up to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region&#160;(830 nm) with a high gabs value of 0.017 at 616 nm. Moreover, HBPH demonstrated NIR emission with a maximum at 798 nm and an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 41%. The excited&#8208;state photophysical properties of HBPH were investigated by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, revealing an intriguing feature that was attributed to the rotational and/or conformational dynamics of HBPH after excitation. These results provide new insight into the design of chiral nanographene with NIR optical properties for potential chiroptical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetranuclear Cu(II) Cluster as the Ten Node Building Unit for the Construction of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of high nuclear copper cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks has not been established yet. Herein, we report a novel MOF (FJU&#8208;112) with the ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper cluster [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] as the node which was capped by the deprotonated organic ligand of H4L (3,5&#8208;Dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid). With BPE (1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) as the pore partitioner, the pore spaces in the structure of FJU&#8208;112 were divided into several smaller cages and smaller windows for efficient gas adsorption and separation. FJU&#8208;112 exhibits a high separation performance for the C2H2/CO2 separation, which were established by the temperature&#8208;dependent sorption isotherms and further confirmed by the lab&#8208;scale dynamic breakthrough experiments. The grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) studies show that its high C2H2/CO2 separation performance is contributed to the strong &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between the C2H2 molecules and framework pore surfaces, leading to its more C2H2 uptakes over CO2 molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium oxides with amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterointerface network for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;VOx batteries are attracting attention in large scale energy storage applications. Yet, the sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and ambiguous structure&#8208;property relationship are always challenging to fulfil the great potential of the batteries. Here we electrodeposit vanadium oxide nanobelts (VO&#8208;E) with highly disordered structure. The electrode achieves high capacities (e.g., ~5 mAh cm&#8208;2, 516 mAh g&#8208;1), good rate and cycling performances. Detailed structure analysis indicates VO&#8208;E is composed of integrated amorphous&#8208;crystalline nanoscale domains, forming an efficient heterointerface network in the bulk electrode, which accounts for the good electrochemical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favorable cation adsorption and lower ion diffusion energy barriers compared to the amorphous and crystalline counterparts, thus accelerating charge carrier mobility and electrochemical activity of the electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Computation, Experiment, and Machine Learning in the Design of Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Materials and Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interest in peptide&#8208;based supramolecular materials has grown extensively since the 1980s and the application of computational methods has paralleled this. These methods contribute to the understanding of experimental observations based on interactions and inform the design of new supramolecular systems. They are also used to virtually screen and navigate these very large design spaces. Increasingly, the use of artificial intelligence is employed to screen far more candidates than traditional methods. Based on a brief history of computational and experimentally integrated investigations of peptide structures, we explore recent impactful examples of computationally driven investigation into peptide self&#8208;assembly, focusing on recent advances in methodology development. It is clear that the integration between experiment and computation to understand and design new systems is becoming near seamless in this growing field.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Different Coordination Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a special carbon material, graphdiyne (GDY) features the superiorities of incomplete charge transfer effect on the atomic level, tunable electronic structure and anchoring metal atoms directly with organometallic coordination bonds M (metal)&#8208;C (alkynyl carbon in GDY), providing it an ideal platform to construct single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACs). The coordination environment of single atoms anchored on GDY plays a key role in their catalytic performance. The mini&#8208;review highlights state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in the rational design of GDY&#8208;based ACs and their applications, and mainly reveals the relationship between the coordination engineering of the GDY&#8208;based ACs and corresponding catalytic performance. Finally, some prospects concerning the future development of GDY&#8208;based ACs in energy conversion are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Easily Switchable 18&#960;&#8208;, 19&#960;&#8208;, and 20&#960;&#8208;Conjugation of Diazaporphyrin Double&#8208;Pincer Bispalladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni(II) 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to Pd(II) ions to provide a pincer&#8208;type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic Pd(II) centers to the&#160;meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ni(II) 3,7,13,17-tetrapyridyl-5,15-diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to Pd(II) ions to provide a pincer-type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic Pd(II) centers to the&#160;meso-nitrogen atoms. We isolated and characterized one- and two-electron reduction species of the bispalladium complex. The 20&#960; antiaromatic nature of the two-electron reduction species was confirmed by&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-vis-near-IR (NIR) absorption spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Atomic Structural Origin of Fictive Temperature Revealed by AZnP3O9 (A = K, Rb) Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fictive temperature (Tf) is widely applied to understand the relaxation thermodynamics of a glass; however, its atomic structural origin is still unclear. Here, we report two novel AZnP3O9 glasses obtained by melting the composition identical single crystals. These glasses exhibit structural inheritance within 5 &#197; from the single crystal counterparts that is quantified by &#948; = nglass/ncry (0 &#8804; &#948; &#8804; 1, n is the number of pair correlation functions). Among the available glass&#8208;formers, glassKZnP3O9 exhibits the highest structural inheritance (&#948; = 1, nglass = 8). More insightfully, a reverse correlation between &#948; and the relaxation thermodynamic parameters is observed in glassAZnP3O9, revealing for the first time the atomic structural origin of fictive temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;long Near&#8208;infrared Repeatable Photochemical Afterglow Mediated by Reversible Storage of Singlet Oxygen for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical afterglow systems have drawn considerable attention in recent years due to their regulable photophysical properties and charming application potential. However, conventional photochemical afterglow suffered from its unrepeatability due to the consumption of energy cache units as afterglow photons are emitted. Here we report a novel strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) through the reversible storage of 1O2 by 2&#8208;pyridones. Near&#8208;infrared afterglow with a lifetime over 10 s is achieved, and its initial intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. A detailed mechanism study was conducted and confirmed the RPA is realized through the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence emission. Furthermore, the generality of this strategy is demonstrated and tunable afterglow lifetimes and colors are achieved by rational design. The developed RPA is further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable&#8208;readout.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Thermal Properties of Polymers through Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of multicomponent solids involving both small and polymeric molecules resulted in the preparation of cocrystals with melting points higher than the melting point of the pure polymer. At the same time, the high mechanical flexibility of the polymer is maintained even under harsh milling conditions, allowing the formation of toroidal nanoparticles with small inner radii and high curvatures.







Abstract
Crystal engineering has exclusively focused on the development of advanced materials based on small organic molecules. We now demonstrate how the cocrystallization of a polymer yields a material with significantly enhanced thermal stability but equivalent mechanical flexibility. Isomorphous replacement of one of the cocrystal components enables the formation of solid solutions with melting points that can be readily fine&#8208;tuned over a usefully wide temperature range. The results of this study credibly extend the scope of crystal engineering and cocrystallization from small molecules to polymers.

         <title>Revealing the Formation Mechanism and Optimizing the Synthesis Conditions of Layered Double Hydroxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a way to investigate the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on layered double hydroxide (LDH) formation. The results revealed the formation mechanism of LDHs and also guided the synthesis of a library of LDHs with desired attributes, in water at room temperature without using any additives.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), whose formation is strongly related to OH&#8722; concentration, have attracted significant interest in various fields. However, the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on LDHs&#8217; formation has not been fully explored due to the unsuitability of the existing synthesis methods for in situ characterization. Here, the deliberately designed combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a solution to the above problem. The obtained results revealed the formation mechanism and also guided us to synthesize a library of LDHs with the desired attributes in water at room temperature without using any additives. After evaluating their oxygen evolution reaction performance, we found that FeNi&#8208;LDH with a Fe/Ni ratio of 25/75 exhibits one of the best performances so far reported.

         <title>Metal Organic Framework Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered metal organic framework (MOF) cubosomes with a single primitive bicontinuous structure by using polymer cubosomes as the template, and also studied their growth mechanism and kinetics as well as potential proteolysis application.







Abstract
We demonstrate a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered bicontinuous&#8208;structured metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by using polymer cubosomes (PCs) with a double primitive structure (Im
m symmetry) as the template. The filling of MOF precursors in the open channel of PCs, followed by their coordination and removal of the template, generates MOF cubosomes with a single primitive topology (Pm
m) and average mesopore diameters of 60&#8211;65&#8197;nm. Mechanism study reveals that the formation of ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes undergoes a new MOF growth process, which involves the formation of individual MOF seeds in the template, their growth and eventual fusion into the cubosomes. Their growth kinetics follows the Avrami equation with an Avrami exponent of n=3 and a growth rate of k=1.33&#215;10&#8722;4, indicating their fast 3D heterogeneous growth mode. Serving as a bioreactor, the ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes show high loading of trypsin enzyme, leading to a high catalytic activity in the proteolysis of bovine serum albumin.

         <title>Direct Monitoring of Li2S2 Evolution and Its Influence on the Reversible Capacities of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of operando spectral results reveal that Li2S2 undergoes chemical reactions accompanied by its electrochemical conversions during operation for the first time. The chemical reactions related to Li2S2 can increase polysulfide dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity contribution. Instead of the commonly considered Li2S, Li2S2 is the solid &#8220;dead&#8221; sulfur species and restricts the actual sulfur utilization and reversible capacity.







Abstract
The polysulfide (PS) dissolution and low conductivity of lithium sulfides (Li2S) are generally considered the main reasons for limiting the reversible capacity of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) system. However, as the inevitable intermediate between PSs and Li2S, lithium disulfide (Li2S2) evolutions are always overlooked. Herein, Li2S2 evolutions are monitored from the operando measurements on the pouch cell level. Results indicate that Li2S2 undergoes slow electrochemical reduction and chemical disproportionation simultaneously during the discharging process, leading to further PS dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity contribution. Compared with the fully oxidized Li2S, Li2S2 still residues at the end of the charging state. Therefore, instead of the considered Li2S and PSs, slow electrochemical conversions and side chemical reactions of Li2S2 are the determining factors in limiting the sulfur utilization, corresponding to the poor reversible capacity of Li&#8208;S batteries.

The chemical reactions related to Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can increase polysulfide dissolution and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S generation without capacity contribution. Instead of the commonly considered Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the solid &#8220;dead&#8221; sulfur species and restricts the actual sulfur utilization and reversible capacity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polysulfide (PS) dissolution and low conductivity of lithium sulfides (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) are generally considered the main reasons for limiting the reversible capacity of the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) system. However, as the inevitable intermediate between PSs and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, lithium disulfide (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) evolutions are always overlooked. Herein, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolutions are monitored from the &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; measurements on the pouch cell level. Results indicate that Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes slow electrochemical reduction and chemical disproportionation simultaneously during the discharging process, leading to further PS dissolution and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S generation without capacity contribution. Compared with the fully oxidized Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; still residues at the end of the charging state. Therefore, instead of the considered Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and PSs, slow electrochemical conversions and side chemical reactions of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the determining factors in limiting the sulfur utilization, corresponding to the poor reversible capacity of Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low Concentration Sulfolane&#8208;Based Electrolyte for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a low concentration electrolyte (LCE) (0.25&#8197;M) with low solubility LiNO3 as the main salt. This LCE shows good separator wettability, high ionic conductivity, high Li+ transference number, and low cost. The rational design of the interphases enables LCE to be suitable for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, lithium metal is stabilized in the highly reactive sulfolane&#8208;based electrolyte under low concentration (0.25&#8197;M) for the first time. Inorganic&#8208;polymer hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high ionic conductivity, low bonding with lithium and high flexibility enables dense chunky lithium deposition and high plating/stripping efficiency. Low concentration electrolyte (LCE) also enables excellent cycling stability of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)/Li cells at 1&#8197;C (90.7&#8201;% retention after 500&#8197;cycles) and 0.3&#8197;C (83.3&#8201;% retention after 1000&#8197;cycles). With a low N/P ratio (&#8776;2), the capacity retention for NCM523/Li cells can achieve 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C. Exploring the LCE is of paramount significance because it provides more possibilities of the lithium salt selections, especially reviving some lithium salts that are excluded before due to their low solubility. More importantly, LCE has the significant advantage of commercialization due to its cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Turning on the Antimicrobial Activity of Gold Nanoclusters Against Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria

&#8220;Turning&#8208;on&#8221; the antimicrobial activity of gold nanoclusters. The addition of thiourea enabled the broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive gold nanoclusters against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
In this work, we show that the addition of thiourea (TU) initiated broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive D&#8208;maltose&#8208;capped gold nanoclusters (AuNC&#8208;Mal). For example, AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was effective against multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (2.5&#8197;&#956;M [Au]) while having 30&#8211;60&#8197;times lower in vitro cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. The reaction of AuNC&#8208;Mal and TU generated the antimicrobial species of [Au(TU)2]+ and smaller AuNCs. TU increased the accumulation of Au in bacteria and helped maintain the oxidation state as AuI (vs. AuIII). The modes of action included the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase, interference with the CuI regulation and depletion of ATP. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity did not change in the presence of colistin or carbonyl cyanide 3&#8208;chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting that AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was indifferent to the outer membrane barrier and to bacterial efflux pumps.

         <title>Enantioselective N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Enals with Carboxylic Acids Using an Iodine(III) Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung of an NHC&#8208;bound enolate with an iodine(III) reagent was developed to enable enantioselective &#945;&#8208;oxidative coupling of enals with carboxylic acids, affording &#945;&#8208;acyloxyl&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters in good yields with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The key step involves the formation of an enol iodine(III) intermediate, which changes the polarity of &#945;&#8208;carbon of the enal from nucleophilic to electrophilic.







Abstract
The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;oxidative coupling of enals with carboxylic acids was developed via the umpolung of an NHC&#8208;bound enolate with an iodine(III) reagent. The corresponding &#945;&#8208;acyloxyl&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters were afforded in good yields, with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The key step of the reaction involves the formation of enol iodine(III) intermediate from the enolate with iodosobenzene, which changes the polarity of &#945;&#8208;carbon of the enal from nucleophilic to electrophilic, and thus facilitates the subsequent addition of carboxylate.

         <title>Second Sphere Effects Promote Formic Acid Dehydrogenation by a Single&#8208;Atom Gold Catalyst Supported on Amino&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold (Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) supported on amino&#8208;functionalized graphdiyne was synthesized, which displayed a fivefold higher catalytic activity than the Au SAC supported on graphdiyne. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the amino groups in the second sphere of the Au atom serve as proton relays to facilitate the H2 formation from an Au&#8722;H intermediate, thus substantially accelerating the rate of formic acid dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Regulating the second sphere of homogeneous molecular catalysts is a common and effective method to boost their catalytic activities, while the second sphere effects have rarely been investigated for heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts primarily due to the synthetic challenge for installing functional groups in their second spheres. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined and readily tailorable structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an Au single&#8208;atom catalyst on amino&#8208;substituted GDY is constructed, where the amino group is located in the second sphere of the Au center. The Au atoms on amino&#8208;decorated GDY displayed superior activity for formic acid dehydrogenation compared with those on unfunctionalized GDY. The experimental studies, particularly the proton inventory studies, and theoretical calculations revealed that the amino groups adjacent to an Au atom could serve as proton relays and thus facilitate the protonation of an intermediate Au&#8722;H to generate H2. Our study paves the way to precisely constructing the functional second sphere on single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Highly Effective Hybrid Copper(I) Iodide Cluster Emitter with Negative Thermal Quenched Phosphorescence for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster (DBA)4Cu4I4 enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a PLQY&gt;94.9&#8201;% by the coaction of excited state structure reorganization and the metallophilicity interaction, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8211;300&#8197;K. Our investigation show that this material has a great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications.







Abstract
The low efficiency triplet emission of hybrid copper(I) iodide clusters is a critical obstacle to their further practical optoelectronic application. Herein, we present an efficient hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster emitter (DBA)4Cu4I4, where the cooperation of excited state structure reorganization and the metallophilicity interaction enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield over 94.9&#8201;%, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8211;300&#8197;K. We also investigate the potential of this emitter for X&#8208;ray imaging. The (DBA)4Cu4I4 wafer demonstrates a light yield higher than 104&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of &#8776;5.0&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1, showing great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Our new copper(I) iodide cluster emitter can serve as a model for investigating the thermodynamic mechanism of photoluminescence in hybrid copper(I) halide phosphorescence materials.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Bioactive Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein chemistry has evolved remarkably in the past decade, which has enabled the effective production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties for biomedical research, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.







Abstract
Nature has developed a plethora of protein machinery to operate and maintain nearly every task of cellular life. These processes are tightly regulated via post&#8208;expression modifications&#8212;transformations that modulate intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and activation. Methods to prepare homogeneously and precisely modified proteins are essential to probe their function and design new bioactive modalities. Synthetic chemistry has contributed remarkably to protein science by allowing the preparation of novel biomacromolecules that are often challenging or impractical to prepare via common biological means. The ability to chemically build and precisely modify proteins has enabled the production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties and programmed activity for biomedical research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructing A Heterogeneous Layer on Lithium Metal Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and High Li&#8208;ion Flux</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense and heterogeneous artificial SEI film is constructed via in situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets with Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of Li+, and lower the nucleation barrier.







Abstract
Constructing efficient artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film is extremely vital for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, a dense artificial SEI film, in which lithiophilic Zn/LixZny are uniformly but nonconsecutively dispersed in the consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors of LixSiOy, Li2O and LiOH, is constructed via the in situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets and Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors can promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of lithium ions, and lower the nucleation barrier. Therefore, a low polarization of &#8776;50&#8197;mV for 750&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and a high capacity retention of 99.2&#8201;% in full cells with a high lithium iron phosphate areal loading of &#8776;13&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. This work offers new sights to develop advanced alkali metal anodes for efficient energy storage.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Production via Selective Two&#8208;electron Mild Electrochemical Oxidation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines Completely to Dihydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines to high&#8208;valued&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines can promote hydrogen production with maximum efficiency, compared with the high energy consumption of four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines.







Abstract
Different from the previous study that biomass derivatives replace water oxidation for enhancing hydrogen production, we found that mild oxidation was more conductive to cathodic hydrogen production. In this study, maximum Faradaic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and lower energy consumption for hydrogen production was achieved by precisely controlling the two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) to dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) in place of the four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines (IQs). Moreover, the high value&#8208;added DHIQs were prepared from THIQs with high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) at the low potential of 1.36&#8197;V. Operando electrochemical Raman and density functional theory proved that the high selectivity was attributed to the regulable active species of NiOOH induced by the interaction of Co and Fe for preferentially breaking C&#8722;H bond rather than N&#8722;H of THIQs. This novel method provides important insight into efficient biomass&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electron Transfer by Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In Sites on In2O3 for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites constructed on Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov catalysts facilitate the PMS adsorption and faster electron transfer through the side&#8208;on adsorption of the O&#8722;O bond, thereby realizing efficient PMS activation to generate more SO4&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH rapidly, and enabling excellent degradation activity of refractory organic pollutants.







Abstract
Enhancing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency to generate more radicals is vital to promote the Fenton&#8208;like reaction activity, however, how to promote the PMS adsorption and accelerate the interfacial electron transfer to boost its activation kinetics remains a great challenge. Herein, we prepared Cu&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich In2O3 (Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov) catalysts containing asymmetric Cu&#8722;Ov&#8722;In sites for PMS activation in water purification. The intrinsic catalytic activity is that the side&#8208;on adsorption configuration of the O&#8722;O bond (Cu&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;In) at the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites significantly stretches the O&#8722;O bond length. Meanwhile, the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites increase the electron density near the Fermi energy level, promoting more and faster electron transfer to the O&#8722;O bond for generating more SO4&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov is 31.8&#8197;times faster than In2O3/Ov, and it shows the possibility of membrane reactor for practical wastewater treatment.

         <title>Electrocrystallization Regulation Enabled Stacked Hexagonal Platelet Growth toward Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A control mechanism of electrolyte on zinc electrocrystallization is proposed and validated through cyclic and linear sulfone cosolvents. The inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) formed by vertical dipole array is able to convert the deposition into activation control by weakening the solvated ion adsorption at the interface, steering conformal stratiform Zn growth and preferred orientation of Zn electrocrystallization.







Abstract
Realizing durative flattened and dendrite&#8208;free zinc (Zn) metal configuration is the key to resolving premature battery failure caused by the internal short circuit, which is highly determined by the crystal growth in the electrocrystallization process. Herein, we report that regulating the molecular structure of the inner Helmholtz plane (HIP) can effectively convert the deposition into activation control by weakening the solvated ion adsorption at the interface. The moderated electrochemical reaction kinetics lower than the adatom self&#8208;diffusion rate steers conformal stratiform Zn growth and dominant Zn (0001) texture, achieving crystallographic optimization. Through in situ mediation of electrolyte engineering, orientational plating and stripping behaviors at edge&#8208;sites and tailored solvation structure immensely improve the utilization efficiency and total charge passed of Zn metal, even under extreme conditions, including high areal capacity (3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Electrooxidative Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H Annulation with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins (up to 99&#8201;% ee) using tBu&#8208;Salox as chiral ligand. The cooperative effect between tBu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Mechanistic studies provided insights into the mechanism of this reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, the merging of electrosynthesis with 3d metal catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a sustainable and powerful technique in organic synthesis. Despite the impressive advantages, the development of an enantioselective version remains elusive and poses a daunting challenge. Herein, we report the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins using an undivided cell at room temperature (up to 99&#8201;% ee). tBu&#8208;Salox, a rationally designed Salox ligand bearing a bulky tert&#8208;butyl group at the ortho&#8208;position of phenol, was found to be crucial for this asymmetric annulation reaction. A strong cooperative effect between tBu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins without secondary bond interactions (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Cyclovoltametric studies, and the preparation, characterization, and transformation of cobaltacycle intermediates shed light on the mechanism of this reaction.

         <title>Direct Probe of Electrochemical Pseudocapacitive pH Jump at a Graphene Electrode
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation, we probe the structure and orientation of interfacial water at a graphene electrode and find phase transition&#8208;like changes. We attribute it to local pH change&#8208;induced pseudocapacitive charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate of the graphene electrode. Our work evidences the molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;level insight into interfacial water at a buried electrode interface is essential in electrochemistry, but spectroscopic probing of the interface remains challenging. Here, using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy, we directly access the interfacial water in contact with the graphene electrode supported on calcium fluoride (CaF2). We find phase transition&#8208;like variations of the HD&#8208;SFG spectra vs. applied potentials, which arises not from the charging/discharging of graphene but from the charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate through the pseudocapacitive process. The potential&#8208;dependent spectra are nearly identical to the pH&#8208;dependent spectra, evidencing that the pseudocapacitive behavior is associated with a substantial local pH change induced by water dissociation between the CaF2 and graphene. Our work evidences the local molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Far&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Driven Photolysis via Triplet Fusion to Enhance Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) system, consisting of a BODIPY photosensitizer and a perylene prodrug (PyCl), released an anti&#8208;cancer drug upon far&#8208;red light irradiation. Encapsulation of this TFP system and a 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor within a nanoparticle enabled far&#8208;red light&#8208;promoted checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for effective inhibition of both local and metastatic tumors under extremely low excitation (20&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven prodrug photoactivation is highly desirable for applications such as neuromodulation, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. Herein, via triplet fusion, we report on the far&#8208;red light&#8208;driven photo&#8208;release of an anti&#8208;cancer drug by coupling the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer with a photocleavable perylene&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer drug. Notably, this metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) strategy can be further advanced by incorporating an additional functional dopant, i.e. an immunotherapy medicine inhibiting the indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO), with the far&#8208;red responsive triplet fusion pair in an air&#8208;stable nanoparticle. With this IDO inhibitor&#8208;assisted TFP system we observed efficient inhibition of primary and distant tumors in a mouse model at record&#8208;low excitation power, compared to other photo&#8208;assisted immunotherapy approaches. This metal&#8208;free TFP strategy will spur advancement in photonics and biophotonics fields.

         <title>Substantial Improvement of an Epimerase for the Synthesis of D&#8208;Allulose by Biosensor&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Microdroplet Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified D&#8208;allulose biosensor was combined with a microdroplet screening system to establish an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening strategy. Structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution were conducted to remodel the SfDAE active pocket and its lid region for enhanced catalytic performance for the synthesis of D&#8208;allulose. This approach shows great potential for the design and optimization of biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platforms.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of D&#8208;allulose has been achieved using ketose 3&#8208;epimerases (KEases), but its application is limited by poor catalytic performance. In this study, we redesigned a genetically encoded biosensor based on a D&#8208;allulose&#8208;responsive transcriptional regulator for real&#8208;time monitoring of D&#8208;allulose. An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput droplet&#8208;based microfluidic screening platform was further constructed by coupling with this D&#8208;allulose&#8208;detecting biosensor for the directed evolution of the KEases. Structural analysis of Sinorhizobium fredii D&#8208;allulose 3&#8208;epimerase (SfDAE) revealed that a highly flexible helix/loop region exposes or occludes the catalytic center as an essential lid conformation regulating substrate recognition. We reprogrammed SfDAE using structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution, in which a mutant M3&#8208;2 was identified with 17&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency. Our research offers a paradigm for the design and optimization of a biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platform.

An ultrahigh-throughput droplet-based microfluidic screening platform was further constructed by coupling with this D-allulose-detecting biosensor for the directed evolution of the KEases. Structural analysis of &lt;i&gt;Sinorhizobium fredii&lt;/i&gt; D-allulose 3-epimerase (SfDAE) revealed that a highly flexible helix/loop region exposes or occludes the catalytic center as an essential lid conformation regulating substrate recognition. We reprogrammed SfDAE using structure-guided rational design and directed evolution, in which a mutant M3-2 was identified with 17-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency. Our research offers a paradigm for the design and optimization of a biosensor-based microdroplet screening platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Speed Tuning of the Formation/Dissociation of a Metallorotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallorotaxane with a tunable formation/dissociation speed has been synthesized by the complexation of a triptycene&#8208;based dumbbell&#8208;shaped mononuclear complex with a crown ether derivative. The inertness of the Pd2+&#8208;phenylenediamine coordination structure allows the metallorotaxane to be slowly but quantitatively generated, with the speed of formation increased up to 27&#8197;times simply by adding an accelerator such as Br&#8722;.







Abstract
Switching between the formation/dissociation of rotaxanes is important to control the function of various types of rotaxane&#8208;based materials. We have developed a convenient and simple strategy, the so&#8208;called &#8220;accelerator addition&#8221;, to make a static rotaxane dynamic without apparently affecting the chemical structure. As an interlocked molecule that enables tuning of the formation/dissociation speed, a metallorotaxane was quantitatively generated by the complexation of a triptycene&#8208;based dumbbell&#8208;shaped mononuclear complex, [PdL2]2+ (L=2,3&#8208;diaminotriptycene), with 27C9. As a result of the inertness of the Pd2+&#8208;based coordination structure, the metallorotaxane was slowly formed (the static state). This rotaxane formation was accelerated 27&#8197;times simply by adding Br&#8722; as an accelerator (the dynamic state). A similar drastic acceleration was also demonstrated during the dissociation process when Cs+ was added to the metallorotaxane to form the free axle [PdL2]2+ and the 27C9&#8208;Cs+ complex.

         <title>Gold Extracted from Wastewater as an Efficient MOF&#8208;Supported Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers takes advantage of the versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), to selectively recover gold from wastewater. More interestingly, the studied MOF serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CO, reaching currents of more than 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The recovery of gold from wastewater is necessary from both environmental and economic standpoints. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can serve as high&#8208;capacity and selective adsorbents, as shown in a recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers. Their novel three&#8208;dimension cationic framework goes further than selectively adsorbing AuCl4&#8722;. It also serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. This work highlights the versatility of MOFs, which can serve as selective adsorbents and as a support for nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Stepwise Engineering the Pore Aperture of a Cage&#8208;like MOF for the Efficient Separation of Isomeric C4 Paraffins under Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both molecular&#8208;sieving separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 uptake are achieved when methyl groups are installed on the pore window of a cage&#8208;like MOF. The hydrophobic microenvironment created by methyl groups eliminates the adverse effects of water vapor on the stability of MOF and n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation.







Abstract
The separation of isomeric C4 paraffins is an important task in the petrochemical industry, while current adsorbents undergo a trade&#8208;off relationship between selectivity and adsorption capacity. In this work, the pore aperture of a cage&#8208;like Zn&#8208;bzc (bzc=pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) is tuned by the stepwise installation methyl groups on its narrow aperture to achieve both molecular&#8208;sieving separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 uptake. Notably, the resulting Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 (bzc&#8208;2CH3=3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) can sensitively capture n&#8208;C4H10 and exclude iso&#8208;C4H10, affording molecular&#8208;sieving for n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity (54.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1). Breakthrough tests prove n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 can be efficiently separated and high&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (99.99&#8201;%) can be collected. Importantly, the hydrophobic microenvironment created by the introduced methyl groups greatly improves the stability of Zn&#8208;bzc and significantly eliminates the negative effect of water vapor on gas separation under humid conditions, indicating Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 is a new benchmark adsorbent for n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation.

         <title>A Molybdenum Disulfide Nanozyme with Charge&#8208;Enhanced Activity for Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acidic tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive and ultrasound&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (BTO/MoS2@CA) is presented that is made from few&#8208;layer MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of piezoelectric tetragonal barium titanate (T&#8208;BTO) and modified with pH&#8208;responsive cinnamaldehyde (CA). The charge&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity, pH&#8208;responsive CA release&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, and glutathione depletion enable out&#8208;of&#8208;balance redox homeostasis, leading to effective tumor ferroptosis.







Abstract
The deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes and insufficient endogenous H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are major obstacles for nanozyme&#8208;mediated catalytic tumor therapy. Since electron transfer is the basic essence of catalysis&#8208;mediated redox reactions, we explored the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on positive and negative charges, which are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to enhance the peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity of a MoS2 nanozyme. Hence, an acidic tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive and ultrasound&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (BTO/MoS2@CA) is presented that is made from few&#8208;layer MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of piezoelectric tetragonal barium titanate (T&#8208;BTO) and modified with pH&#8208;responsive cinnamaldehyde (CA). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive CA&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, ultrasound&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity, and glutathione (GSH) depletion enables out&#8208;of&#8208;balance redox homeostasis, leading to effective tumor ferroptosis with minimal side effects.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Reactions of the Cyaphide Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe three distinct oligomerization reactions of metal complexes bonded to the cyaphide ligand (CP&#8722;). Reductive coupling of a gold cyaphido complex was found to afford a species containing a C2P24&#8722; dimer. By contrast, sterically unprotected metal complexes with more polar M&#8722;CP (M=Ni, Sc) bonds were found to spontaneously oligomerize giving rise to species with bridging C2P22&#8722; and C3P33&#8722; ligands.







Abstract
The cyaphide anion, CP&#8722;, is shown to undergo three distinct oligomerization reactions in the coordination sphere of metals. Reductive coupling of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) by Sm(Cp*)2(OEt2) (Cp*=1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), was found to afford a tetra&#8208;metallic complex containing a 2,3&#8208;diphosphabutadiene&#8208;1,1,4,4&#8208;tetraide fragment. By contrast, non&#8208;reductive dimerization of Ni(SIDipp)(Cp)(CP) (SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; Cp=cyclopentadienyl), gives rise to an asymmetric bimetallic complex containing a 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide moiety. Spontaneous trimerization of Sc(Cp*)2(CP) results in the formation of a trimetallic complex containing a 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triide fragment. These transformations show that while cyaphido transition metal complexes can be readily accessed using metathesis reactions, many such species are unstable to further oligomerization processes.

         <title>Tetramine Aspect Ratio and Flexibility Determine Framework Symmetry for Zn8L6 Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric design rules for the assembly of metal&#8208;organic capsules were derived. The preferred diastereomeric configurations of Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubes, with T, Th, S6 and D3 symmetry, are shown to depend upon the aspect ratio and conformational flexibility of their constituent rectangular subunits. Computational methods allowed further design principles to be deciphered.







Abstract
We derive design principles for the assembly of rectangular tetramines into Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubic coordination cages. Because of the rectangular, as opposed to square, geometry of the ligand panels, and the possibility of either &#916; or &#923; handedness of each metal center at the eight corners of the pseudo&#8208;cube, many different cage diastereomers are possible. Each of the six tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponents investigated in this work assembled with zinc(II) and 2&#8208;formylpyridine in acetonitrile into a single Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cube diastereomer, however. Each product corresponded to one of four diastereomeric configurations, with T, Th, S6 or D3 symmetry. The preferred diastereomer for a given tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponent was shown to be dependent on its aspect ratio and conformational flexibility. Analysis of computationally modeled individual faces or whole pseudo&#8208;cubes provided insight as to why the observed diastereomers were favored.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media is reviewed, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of the active sites, elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationships, the strategic improvement of the catalytic activity/durability, their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, along with current challenges and future perspectives.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital for clean and renewable energy technologies, which require no fossil fuel but catalysts. Platinum (Pt) is the best&#8208;known catalyst for ORR. However, its high cost and scarcity have severely hindered renewable energy devices (e.g., fuel cells) for large&#8208;scale applications. Recent breakthroughs in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) show great potential for earth&#8208;abundant carbon materials as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts towards ORR in acidic media. This article provides a focused, but critical review on C&#8208;MFECs for ORR in acidic media with an emphasis on advances in the structure design and synthesis, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and electrocatalytic mechanisms, and their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Current challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Classification for the Prediction of Catalytic Activity of Organic Photosensitizers in the Nickel(II)&#8208;Salt&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the synthesis of phenols with an inorganic nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer has been developed, together with machine&#8208;learning models to predict the catalytic activity of organic photosensitizers. An investigation into the effect of the descriptors clarified that inputting both physical and structural properties of the organic photosensitizers contributes to the construction of robust machine&#8208;learning models.







Abstract
Catalytic systems using a small amount of organic photosensitizer for the activation of an inorganic (on&#8208;demand ligand&#8208;free) nickel(II) salt represent a cost&#8208;effective method for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while C(sp2)&#8722;O bond formation remains less developed. Herein, we report a strategy for the synthesis of phenols with a nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer, which was identified via an investigation into the catalytic activity of 60 organic photosensitizers consisting of various electron donor and acceptor moieties. To examine the effect of multiple intractable parameters on the catalytic activity of photosensitizers, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were developed, wherein we embedded descriptors representing their physical and structural properties, which were obtained from DFT calculations and RDKit, respectively. The study clarified that integrating both DFT&#8208; and RDKit&#8208;derived descriptors in ML models balances higher &#8220;precision&#8221; and &#8220;recall&#8221; across a wide range of search space relative to using only one of the two descriptor sets.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Superstructures via Hierarchical Assemblies of Giant Rubik's Cubes as Tertiary Building Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building unit, two unprecedented giant superclusters in Rubik's cube's form have been constructed, which further act as isolable tertiary building units to assemble cluster&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Capture of intermediate states clearly and systematically demonstrates the evolution of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures.







Abstract
Intricate superstructures possess unusual structural features and promising applications. The preparation of superstructures with single&#8208;crystalline nature are conducive to understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship, however, remains an intriguing challenge. Herein we put forward a new hierarchical assembly strategy towards rational and precise construction of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Firstly, two unprecedented superclusters in Rubik's cube's form with a size of &#8776;2&#215;2&#215;2&#8197;nm3 are constructed by aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building units (SBUs). Then, the Rubik's cubes further act as isolable tertiary building units (TBUs) to assemble diversified single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Importantly, intermediate assembly states are captured, which helps illustrate the evolution of TBU&#8208;based superstructures and thus provides a profound understanding of the assembly process of superstructures at the atomic level.

         <title>Modulating Cation Migration and Deposition with Xylitol Additive and Oriented Reconstruction of Hydrogen Bonds for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrolyte engineering strategy based on the usage of a small amount of xylitol additive is first proposed, which inhibits the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and SO42&#8722; ions in the primary solvation shell through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Highly reversible plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes is one of the critical processes determining the performance of Zn&#8208;ion batteries, but it is severely impeded by the parasitic side reaction and dendrite growth. Herein, a novel electrolyte engineering strategy is first proposed based on the usage of 100&#8197;mM xylitol additive, which inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening electrostatic interaction through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. Concomitantly, xylitol molecules are preferentially adsorbed by Zn surface, which provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress the planar diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Zn2+ transference number and cycling lifespan of Zn&#8741;Zn cells have been significantly elevated, overwhelmingly larger than bare ZnSO4. The cell coupled with a NaV3O8 cathode still behaves much better than the additive&#8208;free device in terms of capacity retention.

         <title>Multicolor Chromism from a Single Chromophore through Synergistic Coupling of Mechanochromic and Photochromic Subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bis&#8208;mechanophore featuring light&#8208;regulable multicolor mechanochromism has been developed, by synergistically coupling the mechanochromic and photochromic subunits (bis&#8208;rhodamine and bisthienylethene) into one chromophore. Consecutively and/or orthogonally triggered mechanochemical and photochemical reactions of the chromophore&#8208;centered polymers enabled vividly detectable, multicolor switches and gradient optical responses.







Abstract
We report a versatile mechanophore exhibiting a vividly detectable, light&#8208;regulable multicolor mechanochromism. Such optical features rely on the synergistic coupling of mechanochromic bis&#8208;rhodamine (Rh) and photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE). Poly(methyl acrylate)s incorporating this bis&#8208;mechanophore can be mechanically activated under sonication. The relative distribution of the two distinctly colored and fluorescent Rh ring&#8208;opening products is altered with different magnitudes of applied force. Orthogonal use of the photochromic reaction of the BTE core can strengthen the mechanochromism and gate the mechanofluorescence in polymers. Due to increased conjugation offered by the BTE linker, both force&#8208; and light&#8208;induced optical signals display high contrast. Combined DFT simulated and experimental results reveal that the three subunits (two Rhs and one BTE) in this chromophore are activated sequentially, thus generating switchable three&#8208;colored forms and gradient optical responses.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Glass&#8208;Ceramic From a New Polar Phase&#8208;Transition Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polar hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3[Ni(NCS)5], features uncommon thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal transitions under mild conditions, allowing an easy fabrication of an unprecedented hybrid glass&#8208;ceramic that exhibits 25.6&#8197;times enhanced intrinsic SHG effect than its poly&#8208;crystalline form.







Abstract
Melt&#8208;quenched glasses of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals, i.e., hybrid glasses, have attracted increasing attention as an emerging class of hybrid materials with beneficial processability and formability in the past years. Herein, we present a new hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3[Ni(NCS)5] (1, Ph3PEt+=ethyl(triphenyl)phosphonium), crystallizing in a polar space group P1 and exhibiting thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal transitions with relatively low melting temperature of 132&#8201;&#176;C, glass&#8208;transition temperature of 40&#8201;&#176;C, and recrystallization on&#8208;set temperature of 78&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Taking advantage of such mild conditions, we fabricated an unprecedented hybrid glass&#8208;ceramic thin film, i.e., a thin glass uniformly embedding inner polar micro&#8208;crystals, which exhibits a much enhanced intrinsic second&#8208;order nonlinear optical effect, being ca. 25.6 and 3.1&#8197;times those of poly&#8208;crystalline 1 and KH2PO4, respectively, without any poling treatments.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Taxol Enabled by Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Radical Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol, an anticancer drug, possesses an unusually oxygenated and intricately fused 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) structure. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of taxol. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions allowed for connection of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings and cyclization of the B&#8208;ring, respectively. The ABC&#8208;ring was then converted to the target by newly devised functional and protective group manipulations.







Abstract
Taxol is a clinically used drug for the treatment of various types of cancers. Its 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) system is substituted by eight oxygen functional groups and flanked by four acyl groups, including a &#946;&#8208;amino acid side chain. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of this unusually oxygenated and intricately fused structure. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions connected the A&#8208; and C&#8208;ring fragments and cyclized the B&#8208;ring, respectively. Functional groups of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings were then efficiently decorated by employing newly developed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective reactions. Finally, construction of the D&#8208;ring and conjugation with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid delivered taxol. The powerful coupling reactions and functional group manipulations implemented in the present synthesis provide new valuable information for designing multistep target&#8208;oriented syntheses of diverse bioactive natural products.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nacre, the freeze&#8208;casting technique was applied to fabricate tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites, as reported by Qunfeng Cheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216874). The synergistic interfacial interactions between MXene lamellar scaffold and epoxy through surface chemical modification results in high&#8208;performance MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites, which exhibit excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical difunctionalization of alkenes from readily available alkyl halides and organophosphorus reagents possessing a P&#8211;H bond provides an appealing approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl phosphorus compounds. The major challenge arises from the easy generation of a P&#8208;centered radical from the P&#8211;H&#8208;type reagents and its facile addition to the terminal side of alkenes, leading to reverse chemoselectivity. We herein disclose a radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner. The key to the success lies in not only the implementation of dialkyl phosphites with a strong bond dissociation energy to promote the desired chemoselectivity but also the utilization of an anionic chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge the chiral C(sp3)&#8211;P bond. The developed Cu/N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst has enriched our library of single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts in the enantioselective radical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Hydrogenation of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Lactams Enabled by Switching the N&#8208;Chirality of Iridium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented N&#8208;stereogenic center playing an impressive role in the iridium/Rong&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;divergent asymmetric hydrogenation was observed. Rong&#8208;Phos is easily prepared from readily available starting materials, which selectively form two diastereoisomeric Ir&#8208;complexes with fixed N&#8208;chirality via switching the coordination conditions.







Abstract
Central chirality is an important chiral element used in the design of chiral ligands and catalysts. Mostly, the attention of organic chemists is focused on developing of chiral ligands with stable stereogenic centers. However, the N&#8208;chirality in chiral ligand design has been rarely explored due to its flexibility. Here we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and application of a class of simple P,N&#8208;ligands with flexible N&#8208;chirality and their derived iridium complexes with fixed N&#8208;chiral stereocenters. Both fixed configurations of the N&#8208;stereocenter of the iridium complexes could be selectively formed from the same chiral ligand. This pair of diastereoisomeric iridium complexes showed good performance in the enantiodivergent asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated lactams. The N&#8722;H group plays an impressive role in catalytic activity. Computational studies emphasized the importance of N&#8208;chirality and N&#8722;H group.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Mediated Cascade Synthesis of Functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;Benzo&#8208;1,3&#8208;Oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;Ones from Carbon Dioxide</title>

         <dc:description>
A new CO2 based cascade process has been developed towards pharmaceutically relevant benzoxazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The process is empowered by a Ag&#8208;catalyst and shows appreciable structural scope for these target molecules. Mechanistic data and controls are in line with a unique, sequential process that builds on the formation of a five&#8208;membered carbonate intercepted by an N&#8208;centered nucleophile thereby forging a six&#8208;membered cyclic carbamate.







Abstract
A conceptually novel catalytic domino approach is presented for the synthesis of highly functional 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzoxazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. Key to the chemoselectivity is a proper design of the precursor to override thermodynamically favored parasitic cyclization processes and empower the formation of the desired product through Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effects. The synthetic diversity of these CO2&#8208;based heterocycles is further demonstrated, and the isolation of a reaction intermediate supports an unusual ring&#8208;expansion sequence from an &#945;&#8208;alkylidene, five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate to a six&#8208;membered cyclic carbamate by N&#8208;induced isomerization.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Single Electron Reduction of Mono&#8208;Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/tBuOK system was reported for the photoreduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the generation of NHC radical anion as a potent reductant, and the Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage proceeds via a concerted mechanism, where single electron transfer, Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage and KF bond formation take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Fluoroarenes are abundant and readily available feedstocks. However, due to the high reduction potentials of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes, their photoreduction remains a continuing challenge, motivating the development of efficient activation modes to address this issue. This report presents the blue light&#8208;induced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed single electron reduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings. We discovered that under blue light irradiation, NHC/tBuOK combination could construct powerful photoactive architectures to promote single electron transfer for Caryl&#8722;F bond reduction via forming highly reducing NHC radical anion. Notably, the strategy was also successful to reduce Caryl&#8722;O, Caryl&#8722;N, and Caryl&#8722;S bonds for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cell Using a Fluoride&#8208;Assisted Surface Gradient Passivation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record efficiency is achieved for wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cell via a surface gradient passivation strategy. It is found that increasing the distance between F and &#8722;NH3+ of fluorinated ammonium can enhance the electropositivity of &#8722;NH3+, thus providing strong adsorption onto the IA and IPb anti&#8208;site defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the p&#8208;FPEAI (para&#8208;Fluorophenylethylammonium Iodide) modified device affords a record&#8208;efficiency of 21.63&#8201;%.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;band gap (1.68&#8197;eV) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important components of perovskite/Si tandem devices. However, the efficiency of wide band gap PSCs has been limited by their huge open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) deficit due to non&#8208;radiative recombination. Deep&#8208;level acceptor defects are identified as the major killers of Voc, and they can be effectively improved by passivation with ammonium salts. Theoretical calculation predicts that increasing the distance between F and &#8722;NH3+ of fluorinated ammonium can dramatically enhance the electropositivity of &#8722;NH3+ terminals, thus providing strong adsorption onto the negatively charged IA and IPb anti&#8208;site defects. Characterizations further confirm that surface gradient passivation employing p&#8208;FPEAI demonstrates the most efficient passivation effect. Consequently, a record&#8208;efficiency of 21.63&#8201;% with the smallest Voc deficit of 441&#8197;mV is achieved for 1.68&#8197;eV&#8208;band gap inverted PSCs. Additionally, a flexible PSC and 1&#8197;cm2 opaque device also deliver the highest PCEs of 21.02&#8201;% and 19.31&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs for Targeted Degradation of Extracellular and Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have emerged as a promising technology that expands the scope of targeted protein degradation to extracellular targets. However, the preparation of chimeras by conjugation of the antibody and trivalent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (tri&#8208;GalNAc) is a complex and time&#8208;consuming process. The large uncertainty in number and position and the large molecular weights of the chimeras results in low internalization efficiency. To circumvent these problems, we developed the first aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (Apt&#8208;LYTAC) to realize liver cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GalNAc. Taking advantage of the facile synthesis and low molecular weight of aptamer, the Apt&#8208;LYTACs can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through a lysosomal degradation pathway. We anticipate that the novel Apt&#8208;LYTACs will expand the usage of aptamers and provide a new dimension for targeted protein degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrooxidative Activation of B&#8211;B Bond in B2cat2: Access to gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes via Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the unprecedented electrooxidation of a solvent (e.g., DMF)&#8208;ligated B2cat2 complex, whereby a solvent&#8208;stabilized boryl radical is formed via quasi&#8208;homolytic cleavage of the B&#8211;B bond in a DMF&#8208;ligated B2cat2 radical cation. Cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory provide evidence to support this novel B&#8211;B bond activation strategy. Furthermore, a strategy for the electrochemical gem&#8208;diborylation of gem&#8208;bromides via paired electrolysis is developed for the first time, affording a range of versatile gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, which are widely used in synthetic society. Notably, this reaction approach is scalable, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and requires no external activator.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Anionic Cages Dictated by Organophosphate&#8208;Based Chiral Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the signal transduction function of organophosphates in biological systems, bioactive organophosphates were utilized for the first time as chiral nodes to dictate the stereoselective assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages. Phosphonomycin (antibiotics), tenofovir (antivirals), adenosine monophosphate (natural product, AMP)&#160; and clindamycin phosphate (antibiotics) were assembled respectively with an achiral bis&#8208;monourea ligand, leading to the stereoselective formation of quadruple or triple helicates. The extent of the stereoselectivity could be enhanced by either lowering the temperature or adding stronger&#8208;binding cations as templates. With the chiral anionic cages as the host, some enantioselectivity was achieved when binding chiral quaternary ammonium cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Camouflaged Virus&#8208;like Nanocarrier with Transformable Rough Surface for Boosting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the nonspecific strong nano&#8208;bio interaction, the nanocarriers with permanent rough surface are difficult to cross the multiple biological barriers to realize the efficient delivery. Herein, a camouflaged virus&#8208;like nanocarrier with transformable rough surface is reported, which is composed by inner virus&#8208;like mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticle with rough surface (vSiO2) and outer acid responsive camouflage polymer. At normal physiological environment, the spikes on vSiO2 are hidden by outer polymer, which can effectively inhibit the rough surface induced nonspecific strong nano&#8208;bio interaction. While in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the rough surface can be re&#8208;exposed by shedding the polymer camouflage, thus improving its retention ability and promoting endocytosis of the nanocarrier by tumor cell. Based on its dynamically variable rough surface, the rationally designed smart nanocarrier exhibit extended blood circulation and enhanced tumor accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tetrahedral Bisacridine Donor Enables Fast Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off simultaneously is of great significance for further application of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. A balance between radiative decay and reversed intersystem crossing must be carefully established. Herein, we propose a qunolino&#8208;acridine (QAc) donor composing two acridine with both planar (pAc) and bended (bAc) geometries. Combining with triazine, a TADF emitter QAc&#8208;TRZ is assembled. The pAc provides a well interaction with triazine which ensures a decent TADF behavior, while the bAc offers a delocalization of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) which guarantees an enhancement of radiative decay. Remarkably, QAc&#8208;TRZ enables a highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3%. More importantly, the efficiencies under 100/1000 cd/m2 stay 36.3% and 31.7%, respectively, and remain 21.5% even under 10000 cd/m2.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Nitric Oxide&#8208;Responsive Nanosensor for Photoacoustic Imaging in the SWIR Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shortwave infrared (SWIR) dyes are characterized by their ability to absorb light from 900 to 1400 nm, which is ideal for deep tissue imaging owing to minimized light scattering and interference from endogenous pigments. An approach to access such molecules is to tune the photophysical properties of known near&#8208;infrared dyes. Herein, we report the development of a series of easily accessible (three steps) SWIR xanthene dyes based on a dibenzazepine donor conjugated to thiophene (SCR&#8208;1), thienothiophene (SCR&#8208;2), or bithiophene (SCR&#8208;3). We leverage the fact that SCR&#8208;1 undergoes a bathochromic shift when aggregated for in vivo studies by developing a ratiometric nanoparticle for NO (rNP&#8208;NO), which we employed to successfully visualize pathological levels of nitric oxide in a drug&#8208;induced liver injury model via deep tissue SWIR photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Our work demonstrates how easily this dye series can be utilized as a component in nanosensor designs for imaging studies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double Atomic&#8208;Tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG Nanostructure with Optimum Charge Redistribution for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge redistribution on surface of Ru nanoparticle can significantly affect electrocatalytic HER activity. Herein, a double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure that features RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticle supported by Bi&#8722;O single&#8208;site&#8208;doped graphene was successfully developed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site in RuBi SAA/Bi@OG can synergistically manipulate electron transfer on Ru surface leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity. Its mass activity is up to 65000 mA mg&#8211;1 at an overpotential of 150 mV, which is 72.2 times as much as that of commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the RuBi SAA/Bi@OG possesses the optimum charge redistribution, which is most beneficial to strengthen adsorption of water and weaken hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy in HER process. This double atomic&#8208;tuned strategy on surface charge redistribution of Ru nanoparticle opens a new way to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular Radical Amidation and Amination of Benzylic C&#8211;H Bonds via Dual Copper and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for direct access to enantioenriched benzylic amides and carbamate&#8208;protected primary benzylamines by C&#8211;H functionalization is reported. The C&#8211;H substrate is used as limiting reagent with only a small excess of the unactivated amide or carbamate nucleophile. The enantioselective intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8211;N bond formation is enabled by a combination of a chiral copper catalyst, a photocatalyst, and an oxidant, and it takes place under mild conditions, which allow for a broad substrate scope. The method is compatible with late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization, and it provides easy access to 15N&#8208;labeled amides and amines starting from cheap 15NH4Cl.</dc:description>

         <title>"Pore&#8208;Hopping" Ion Transport in Cellulose&#8208;Based Separator Towards High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Cellulose is an attractive material for sustainable separators, but still exists some key issues affecting its application. Herein, cellulose&#8208;based composite separator (CP@PPC) was prepared by immersion curing of cellulose&#8208;based separators (CP) with polypropylene carbonate (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, CP@PPC separator is able to operate the cell stably at high voltages (up to 4.95 V). The "pore&#8208;hopping" ion transport mechanism in CP@PPC opens up extra Na+ migration paths, resulting in a high Na+ transport number (0.613). The separator can also tolerate folding, bending and extreme temperature under certain circumstances. Full cells with CP@PPC reveal one&#8208;up capacity retention (96.97%) at 2C after 500 cycles compared to cells with CP. The mechanism highlights the merits of electrolyte analogs in separator modification, making a rational design for durable devices in advanced energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Alloying&#8208;Triggered Phase Engineering of NiFe System via Laser&#8208;Assisted Al Incorporation for Full Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to design one non&#8208;noble material with balanced bifunctional performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for commercial sustainability at a low cost since the different electrocatalytic mechanisms are not easily matchable for each other. Herein, a self&#8208;standing hybrid system Ni18Fe12Al70 , consisting of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe phases, was constructed by laser&#8208;assisted aluminum (Al) incorporation towards full water splitting. It was found that the incorporation of Al could effectively tune the morphologies, compositions and phases. The results indicate that Ni18Fe12Al70 delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger both HER (&#951;100 = 188 mV) and OER (&#951;100 = 345 mV) processes and maintains a stable overpotential for 100 h, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The synergistic effect of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe alloys on the HER process is confirmed based on theoretical calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphoteric Cellulose&#8208;Based Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Electrolyte Toward Ultra&#8208;stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc (Zn) metal anode suffers from uncontrollable Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions at the interface, which restrict the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries (ARZBs). Herein, an amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network is introduced as hydrogel electrolyte to overcome these obstacles. On one hand, the amphoteric groups build anion/cation transport channels to regulate electro&#8208;deposition behavior on Zn (002) crystal plane enabled by homogenizing Zn2+ ions flux. On the other hand, the strong bonding between negatively charged carboxyl groups and Zn2+ ions promote the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions. Based on the above two functions, the hydrogel electrolyte enables an ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a cumulative capacity of 7 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 20 mA cm&#8722;2/20 mAh cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn cell. This work provides significant concepts for developing hydrogel electrolytes to realize stable anode for high&#8208;performance ARZBs.</dc:description>

The hydrogen bonding links adjacent spacing sheets in (GABA)2MA3Pb4I13 (MA = CH3NH3+), leading to the charges localized in the van der Waals gap, thereby constructing &#8220;charged&#8208;bridge&#8221; for charge transfer through the spacing region.

         <title>Direct Deprotonative Functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethyl Ketones using a Catalytic Organosuperbase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deprotonation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones is underinvestigated due to the instability of the generated carbanion that can evolve into a fluorocarbene. A method for the deprotonative functionalization of these compounds is described herein under an organocatalytic system using various electrophiles, and is also applied to a related &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl sulfoxide. This strategy gives access to highly valuable difluoromethylene scaffolds.







Abstract
The deprotonative functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones is described herein. Using a catalytic organosuperbase and a silane additive, the corresponding difluoroenolate could be generated and trapped with aldehydes to deliver various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones in high yields. This new strategy tolerates numerous functional groups and represents the access to the difluoroenolate by direct deprotonation of the difluoromethyl unit. The diastereoselective version of the reaction was also investigated with d.r. up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7. Several transformations were performed to demonstrate the synthetic potential of these &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. In addition, this method has been extended to the use of other electrophiles such as imines and chalcogen derivatives, and a difluoromethyl sulfoxide as nucleophile, thus leading to a diversity of difluoromethylene compounds.

Using a catalytic organosuperbase and a silane additive, the corresponding difluoroenolate could be generated and trapped with aldehydes to deliver various &#945;,&#945;-difluoro-&#946;-hydroxy ketones in high yields. This new strategy tolerates numerous functional groups and represents the access to the difluoroenolate by direct deprotonation of the difluoromethyl unit. The diastereoselective version of the reaction was also investigated with &lt;i&gt;d.r&lt;/i&gt;. up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7. Several transformations were performed to demonstrate the synthetic potential of these &#945;,&#945;-difluoro-&#946;-hydroxy ketones. In addition, this method has been extended to the use of other electrophiles such as imines and chalcogen derivatives, and a difluoromethyl sulfoxide as nucleophile, thus leading to a diversity of difluoromethylene compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Evoke Pyroptosis for High&#8208;Efficiency Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic therapeutic effect and immunogenicity of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles were studied. The nanoparticles can intrinsically induce pyroptosis accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death to further activate antitumor immunity and reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thus realizing high&#8208;efficiency immunotherapy and tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
Although zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been applied in various tumor therapies, the intrinsic immunogenicity remains unclear. Here, we initiatively discover that ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (NPs) can intrinsically induce pyroptosis by a caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;dependent pathway. The pyroptotic cell death is accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD) simultaneously for efficient in situ immunity initiation. Meanwhile, carbonyl cyanide m&#8208;chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial depolarizing agent, is successfully loaded into ZIF&#8208;8 NPs and found to further enhance the pyroptosis process. Collectively, the obtained Pluronic F127&#8208;modified CCCP&#8208;incorporated ZIF&#8208;8 NPs (F127ZIF&#8208;8CCCP NPs) activate antitumor immunity and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), realizing high&#8208;efficiency tumor growth inhibition. This work will facilitate biomedicine applications of ZIF&#8208;8 and provide good inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;induced cancer therapy.

         <title>Smart Nanosensitizers for Activatable Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Tumors by Redox&#8208;Controlled Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;targeted and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers (1&#8208;NPs) are fabricated via co&#8208;assembly and disassembly processes, which confer burst release of small molecules 2&#8208;Gd, Zn&#8208;PPA&#8208;SH and NLG919 within tumor cells, enabling fluorescence and magnetic resonance bimodal imaging&#8208;guided sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors and deep&#8208;seated GL261 gliomas in mice upon irradiation with combined ultrasound (US) and 671&#8208;nm laser (hv).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted and stimuli&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers are highly desirable for cancer theranostics. However, designing smart nanosensitizers with multiple imaging signals and synergistic therapeutic activities switched on is challenging. Herein, we report tumor&#8208;targeted and redox&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers (1&#8208;NPs) for sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of tumors by molecular co&#8208;assembly and redox&#8208;controlled disassembly. 1&#8208;NPs show a high longitudinal relaxivity (r1=18.7&#177;0.3&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), but &#8220;off&#8221; dual fluorescence (FL) emission (at 547 and 672&#8197;nm), &#8220;off&#8221; sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibition activities. Upon reduction by glutathione (GSH), 1&#8208;NPs rapidly disassemble and remotely release small molecules 2&#8208;Gd, Zn&#8208;PPA&#8208;SH and NLG919, concurrently switching on (1)&#8197;dual FL emission, (2)&#8197;sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and (3)&#8197;IDO1 inhibition activities. After systemic injection, 1&#8208;NPs are effective for bimodal FL and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging&#8208;guided sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of orthotropic breast and brain tumors in mice under combined ultrasound (US) and 671&#8208;nm laser irradiation.

         <title>Isolation of an Annulated 1,4&#8208;Distibabenzene Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide (cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene) compound 5 is isolated as a crystalline solid. 5 undergoes 2e&#8208;oxidation to the dicationic compound (6)2+, which can be reduced back to 5. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet solution. (6)+2 is stabilized by the delocalization of unpaired electrons over the benzenoid C4Sb2 ring and has 39&#8201;% diradical character.







Abstract
The first 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Sb]2 (5) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC) (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported as a bordeaux&#8208;red solid. Compound 5, featuring a central six&#8208;membered C4Sb2 ring with formally SbI atoms may be regarded as a base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene in which each of the Sb atoms bears two lone&#8208;pairs of electrons. 5 undergoes 2&#8201;e&#8208;oxidation with Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] to afford [(ADC)Sb]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (6) as a brick&#8208;red solid. Each of the Sb atoms of 6 has an unpaired electron and a lone&#8208;pair. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet diradical solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet. The diradical character of (6)2+ according to SS&#8208;CASSCF (state&#8208;specific complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) and UHF (unrestricted Hartree&#8208;Fock) methods amounts to 36&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively. Treatments of 6 with (PhE)2 yield [(ADC)Sb(EPh)]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (7&#8208;E) (E=S or Se). Reaction of 5 with (cod)Mo(CO)4 affords [(ADC)Sb]2Mo(CO)4 (8).

         <title>Electron Spin Catalysis with Graphene Belts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene belts with high electron spin concentrations, which were synthesized by C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) radical coupling, act as aerobic spin catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine; the catalytic mechanism has been studied by electron spin resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Here, we report kinetic studies using electron spin resonance spectroscopy on spin catalysis reactions caused by using graphene belts which were synthesized by a radical coupling method. The results show that &#963;&#8208;type free radical species provide the dominant sites for catalytic activity through the spin&#8208;spin interaction, although there are some other influencing factors. The spin catalysis mechanism can be applied both in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and in organic synthesis. The graphene belt spin catalyst shows excellent performance with a high ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V and long&#8208;term stability with almost no loss of activity after 50&#8201;000 cycles in alkaline media. It also shows excellent performance in a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine at an average conversion of &#8776;97.7&#8201;% and an average yield of &#8776;97.9&#8201;%. This work opens up a new research direction for understanding aerobic processes in the field of spin catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene belts with high electron spin concentrations, which were synthesized by C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) radical coupling, act as aerobic spin catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine; the catalytic mechanism has been studied by electron spin resonance spectroscopy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we report kinetic studies using electron spin resonance spectroscopy on spin catalysis reactions caused by using graphene belts which were synthesized by a radical coupling method. The results show that &#963;-type free radical species provide the dominant sites for catalytic activity through the spin-spin interaction, although there are some other influencing factors. The spin catalysis mechanism can be applied both in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and in organic synthesis. The graphene belt spin catalyst shows excellent performance with a high ORR half-wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V and long-term stability with almost no loss of activity after 50&#8201;000 cycles in alkaline media. It also shows excellent performance in a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine at an average conversion of &#8776;97.7&#8201;% and an average yield of &#8776;97.9&#8201;%. This work opens up a new research direction for understanding aerobic processes in the field of spin catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Separation of Lithium, Magnesium and Calcium using 4&#8208;Phosphoryl Pyrazolones as pH&#8208;Regulated Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise separation of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Li+ has been achieved by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction employing a series of advanced 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolone ligands together with TOPO (trioctylphosphine oxide) as co&#8208;ligand via pH regulation. X&#8208;ray crystal structure determinations of selected complexes revealed diverse binding modes across all three metal species.







Abstract
Ensuring continuous and sustainable lithium supply requires the development of highly efficient separation processes such as LLE (liquid&#8208;liquid extraction) for both primary sources and certain waste streams. In this work, 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones are used in an efficient pH&#8208;controlled stepwise separation of Li+ from Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+. The factors affecting LLE process, such as the substitution pattern of the extractant, diluent/water distribution, co&#8208;ligand, pH, and speciation of the metal complexes involved, were systematically investigated. The maximum extraction efficiency of Li+ at pH&#8197;6.0 was 94&#8201;% when Mg2+ and Ca2+ were previously separated at pH&lt;5.0, proving that the separation of these ions is possible by simply modulating the pH of the aqueous phase. Our study points a way to separation of lithium from acid brine or from spent lithium ion battery leaching solutions, which supports the future supply of lithium in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Oxycarbenes: New Synthetic and Catalytic Applications beyond Group 6 Fischer Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxycarbenes have emerged as useful intermediates in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes early synthetic and catalytic applications of late&#8208;transition&#8208;metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes.







Abstract
Oxycarbenes have emerged as useful intermediates in synthetic chemistry. Compared to the widely studied oxycarbene metal complexes bearing Group 6 metals, the synthetic and catalytic applications of oxycarbenes beyond Group 6 Fischer carbene complexes are less explored because of the difficulty in controlling their reactivity and the need to use a stoichiometric amount of a presynthesized Group 6 metal carbene complex as the starting material. This Minireview summarizes early synthetic and catalytic applications of late&#8208;transition&#8208;metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes. We hope this Minireview will inspire further developments in this emerging area.

         <title>Expanded Conformations of Monomeric Tau Initiate Its Amyloidogenesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule analysis of tau shows that pro&#8208;amyloidogenic mutations and chemical environment shift the monomeric conformational landscape towards expanded conformers, exposing amyloidogenic hexapeptides. The chemical environment also originates structural rearrangements, which may be behind the polymorphic amyloid structures found across tauopathies. Conversely, anti&#8208;amyloidogenic factors promote the formation of collapsed conformers with a specific inert structure.







Abstract
Understanding early amyloidogenesis is key to rationally develop therapeutic strategies. Tau protein forms well&#8208;characterized pathological deposits but its aggregation mechanism is still poorly understood. Using single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy based on a mechanical protection strategy, we studied the conformational landscape of the monomeric tau repeat domain (tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368). We found two sets of conformational states, whose frequency is influenced by mutations and the chemical context. While pathological mutations &#916;280K and P301L and a pro&#8208;amyloidogenic milieu favored expanded conformations and destabilized local structures, an anti&#8208;amyloidogenic environment promoted a compact ensemble, including a conformer whose topology might mask two amyloidogenic segments. Our results reveal that to initiate aggregation, monomeric tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368 decreases its polymorphism adopting expanded conformations. This could account for the distinct structures found in vitro and across tauopathies.

         <title>Spectroscopic Identification of Diphosphene HPPH and Isomeric Diphosphinyldene PPH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simplest diphosphene HPPH (cis and trans conformers) and diphosphinyldene PPH2 have been generated and spectroscopically characterized in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10&#8197;K. In addition to the photo&#8208;induced conversion of these P2H2 isomers, the prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties have been disclosed.







Abstract
The simplest diphosphene HPPH and isomeric diphosphinyldene PPH2 features prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties that have been of long&#8208;standing interest in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the observation of cis&#8208;HPPH, trans&#8208;HPPH, and PPH2 among the respective laser photolysis products of phosphine (PH3) and diphosphine (P2H4) in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10&#8197;K. The identification of these P2H2 isomers with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy is supported by D&#8208;isotope labeling and the quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;F12 level using configuration&#8208;selective vibrational configuration interaction theory (VCI). Bonding analyses suggest that the two conformers of HPPH contain standard PP double bonds, whereas, PPH2 resembles P2 in having partial PP triple bond due to the H2P&#8592;P &#960; bonding interaction.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Strengthened Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Degradable X&#8208;ray Detector with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility and Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work first designed and synthesized metal&#8208;free MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O perovskites by introducing bulk methyl groups to improve tolerance factor and enhance hydrogen bonds for improving its stability and performance. Importantly, the related flexible X&#8208;ray detector shows the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and promises to realize non&#8208;toxic degradation, mechanical bending stability and array imaging for future application.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) with flexible and degradable properties have been adopted in flexible X&#8208;ray detection. For now, figuring out the key factors between structure and device performance are critical to guide the design of MFPs. Herein, MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O was first designed and synthesized with improved structural stability and device performance. Through theoretical calculations, the introducing methyl group benefits modulating tolerance factor, increases dipole moment and strengthens hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, H2O increases the hydrogen bond formation sites and synergistically realizes the band nature modulation, ionic migration inhibition and structural stiffness optimization. Spectra analysis also proves that the improved electron&#8208;phonon coupling and carrier recombination lifetime contribute to enhanced performance. Finally, a flexible and degradable X&#8208;ray detector was fabricated with the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit (0.14&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1).

&lt;p&gt;This work first designed and synthesized metal-free MPAZE-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O perovskites by introducing bulk methyl groups to improve tolerance factor and enhance hydrogen bonds for improving its stability and performance. Importantly, the related flexible X-ray detector shows the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and promises to realize non-toxic degradation, mechanical bending stability and array imaging for future application.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-free perovskites (MFPs) with flexible and degradable properties have been adopted in flexible X-ray detection. For now, figuring out the key factors between structure and device performance are critical to guide the design of MFPs. Herein, MPAZE-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was first designed and synthesized with improved structural stability and device performance. Through theoretical calculations, the introducing methyl group benefits modulating tolerance factor, increases dipole moment and strengthens hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increases the hydrogen bond formation sites and synergistically realizes the band nature modulation, ionic migration inhibition and structural stiffness optimization. Spectra analysis also proves that the improved electron-phonon coupling and carrier recombination lifetime contribute to enhanced performance. Finally, a flexible and degradable X-ray detector was fabricated with the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low detection limit (0.14&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oral Anticancer Heterobimetallic PtIV&#8722;AuI Complexes Show High In Vivo Activity and Low Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral anticancer heterobimetallic PtIV&#8722;AuI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes with a dual mechanism of action show high potency with low toxicity in vivo. The conjugation of two metals results in an enhanced inhibitory effect towards thioredoxin reductase and facilitates the co&#8208;transport of the prodrug into the tumor before activation.







Abstract
AuI&#8208;carbene and PtIV&#8722;AuI&#8208;carbene prodrugs display low to sub&#8208;&#956;M activity against several cancer cell lines and overcome cisplatin (cisPt) resistance. Linking a cisPt&#8208;derived PtIV(phenylbutyrate) complex to a AuI&#8208;phenylimidazolylidene complex 2, yielded the most potent prodrug. While in vivo tests against Lewis Lung Carcinoma showed that the prodrug PtIV(phenylbutyrate)&#8208;AuI&#8208;carbene (7) and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;administration of cisPt: phenylbutyrate:2 efficiently inhibited tumor growth (&#8776;95&#8201;%), much better than 2 (75&#8201;%) or cisPt (84&#8201;%), 7 exhibited only 5&#8201;% body weight loss compared to 14&#8201;% for 2, 20&#8201;% for cisPt and &gt;30&#8201;% for the co&#8208;administration. 7 was much more efficient than 2 at inhibiting TrxR activity in the isolated enzyme, in cells and in the tumor, even though it was much less efficient than 2 at binding to selenocysteine peptides modeling the active site of TrxR. Organ distribution and laser&#8208;ablation (LA)&#8208;ICP&#8208;TOFMS imaging suggest that 7 arrives intact at the tumor and is activated there.

         <title>Monitoring Photoinduced Interparticle Chemical Communication In Situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ monitoring of photoinduced chemical communication between single Ag nanoparticles is achieved via the stochastic collision electrochemistry. The superior sensitivity enables to investigate the dynamic chemical potential difference at the single&#8208;nanoparticle level, indicating the cooperative interparticle communication controls the morphology transformation kinetics, thereby determining the final structure of collective Ag nanoparticles.







Abstract
Monitoring interparticle chemical communication plays a critical role in the nanomaterial synthesis as this communication controls the final structure and stability of global nanoparticles (NPs). Yet most ensemble analytical techniques, which could only reveal average macroscopic information, are unable to elucidate NP&#8208;to&#8208;NP interactions. Herein, we employ stochastic collision electrochemistry to track the morphology transformation of Ag NPs in photochemical process at the single NP level. By further statistical analysis of time&#8208;resolved current transients, we quantitatively determine the dynamic chemical potential difference and interparticle communication between populations of large and small Ag NPs. The high sensitivity of stochastic collision electrochemistry enables the in situ investigation of chemical communication&#8208;dependent transformation kinetics of NPs in photochemical process, shedding light on designing nanomaterials.

         <title>Designed Iron Catalysts for Allylic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Propylene and Simple Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl complex was discovered to enable the coupling of the allylic carbon of propylene and carbonyl electrophiles. This approach was also successfully applied to allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of simple olefins. Experimental and computational studies provided insights into the mechanism and origins of ligand effects on reactivity and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Propylene gas is produced worldwide by steam cracking on million&#8208;metric&#8208;ton scale per year. It serves as a valuable starting material for &#960;&#8208;bond functionalization but is rarely applied in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H functionalization for fine chemical synthesis. Herein, we report that a newly&#8208;developed cationic cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl complex allows for the conversion of propylene to its allylic C&#8722;C bond coupling products under catalytic conditions. This approach was also found applicable to the allylic functionalization of simple &#945;&#8208;olefins with distinctive branched selectivity. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies supported the allylic deprotonation of the metal&#8208;coordinated alkene as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and led to insights into the multifaceted roles of the newly designed ligand in promoting allylic C&#8722;H functionalization with enhanced reactivity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Allosteric Regulation of Aptamer Affinity through Mechano&#8208;Chemical Coupling
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a simple and effective strategy for reversibly fine&#8208;tuning aptamer affinity by an allosteric molecular clamp that perturbs aptamer folding through mechanical extension, forcing it into a state in which its binding competency is considerably reduced. Aptamer affinity is regulated by tuning the mechanical properties of the molecular clamp.







Abstract
The capacity to precisely modulate aptamer affinity is important for a wide variety of applications. However, most such engineering strategies entail laborious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing or require prior knowledge of an aptamer's structure and ligand&#8208;binding domain. We describe here a simple and generalizable strategy for allosteric modulation of aptamer affinity by employing a double&#8208;stranded molecular clamp that destabilizes aptamer secondary structure through mechanical tension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer and show that we can alter its affinity by as much as 65&#8208;fold. We also show that this modulation can be rendered reversible by introducing a restriction enzyme cleavage site into the molecular clamp domain and describe a design strategy for achieving even more finely&#8208;tuned affinity modulation. This strategy requires no prior knowledge of the aptamer's structure and binding mechanism and should thus be generalizable across aptamers.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Controlled Radical Branching Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble inibramer, sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate, triggered branching during photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization of methacrylate monomers in the open air. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymers with controlled molecular weights, degrees of branching, and low dispersity values were obtained in water. The radical branching polymerization also exhibited spatial control and enabled the synthesis of branched polymer bioconjugates.







Abstract
Hyperbranched polymethacrylates were synthesized by green&#8208;light&#8208;induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) under biologically relevant conditions in the open air. Sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate (SBA) was prepared in situ from commercially available 2&#8208;bromoacrylic acid and used as a water&#8208;soluble inibramer to induce branching during the copolymerization of methacrylate monomers. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymethacrylates were obtained in less than 30&#8197;min with predetermined molecular weights (36&#8201;000&lt;Mn&lt;170&#8201;000), tunable degree of branching, and low dispersity values (1.14&#8804;&#272;&#8804;1.33). Moreover, the use of SBA inibramer enabled the synthesis of bioconjugates with a well&#8208;controlled branched architecture.

&lt;p&gt;A water-soluble inibramer, sodium 2-bromoacrylate, triggered branching during photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization of methacrylate monomers in the open air. As a result, well-defined branched polymers with controlled molecular weights, degrees of branching, and low dispersity values were obtained in water. The radical branching polymerization also exhibited spatial control and enabled the synthesis of branched polymer bioconjugates.

         <title>Biotechnological Frontiers of DNA Nanomaterials Continue to Expand: Bacterial Infection using Virus&#8208;Inspired Capsids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the engineering of virus&#8208;inspired DNA&#8208;origami particles loaded with natural bacteriophage genomic cargo; scientists measured a retained functional infection in non&#8208;competent bacterial cells. Critical parameters for infectivity include structural rigidity and complete yet dynamic loading of the cargo through multivalent optimization of anchors.







Abstract
The elegant geometry of viruses has inspired bio&#8208;engineers to synthetically explore the self&#8208;assembly of polyhedral capsids employed to protect new cargo or change an enzymatic microenvironment. Recently, Yang and co&#8208;workers used DNA nanotechnology to revisit the icosahedral capsid structure of the phiX174 bacteriophage and reloaded the original viral genome as cargo into their fully synthetic architecture. Surprisingly, when using a favorable combination of structural rigidity and dynamic multivalent cargo entrapment, the synthetic particles were able to infect non&#8208;competent bacterial cells and produce the original phiX174 bacteriophage. This work presents an exciting new direction of DNA nanotech for bio&#8208;engineering applications which involve bacterial interactions.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Lasing from a Microcavity Filled with Achiral Single&#8208;Crystalline Microribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized (CP) lasing with high dissymmetry factors has been realized in an organic crystal&#8208;filled cavity without any chiral materials or structures, as reported by Qing Liao, Hongbing Fu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213229). The anisotropic refractive properties of two&#8208;dimensional organic single crystals lead to the Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus effect inducing spin&#8208;splitting of cavity modes. The results provide a new idea for the design of CP lasers towards future 3D laser displays, information storage and other fields.

         <title>Swelling&#8208;induced Mechanochromism in Multinetwork Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The swelling force exerted by solvents in polymer gels is revealed to trigger mechanochemical reactions, as reported by Takuma Watabe and Hideyuki Otsuka in their research article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216469). A multinetwork strategy based on sequential monomer swelling and polymerization processes makes the original network sensitive to mechanical stimuli. A slight volume expansion caused by swelling leads to the activation of mechano&#8208;responsive linkers in the first network, exhibiting a notable color change.

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption of Epoxy&#8208;Functional Nanoparticles onto Stainless Steel Significantly Reduces Friction in Tribological Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of epoxy groups into sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles leads to their efficient chemical adsorption onto stainless steel whereas the corresponding non&#8208;functional nanoparticles merely undergo physical adsorption. Significantly greater adsorption occurs when the epoxy groups are placed within the steric stabilizer chains, which leads to enhanced lubrication in tribology studies.







Abstract
Epoxy&#8208;functional sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (ca. 27&#8197;nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil. Nanoparticle adsorption onto stainless steel is examined using a quartz crystal microbalance. Incorporating epoxy groups within the steric stabilizer chains results in a two&#8208;fold increase in the adsorbed amount, &#915;, at 20&#8201;&#176;C (7.6&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2) compared to epoxy&#8208;core functional nanoparticles (3.7&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2) or non&#8208;functional nanoparticles (3.8&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2). A larger difference in &#915; is observed at 40&#8201;&#176;C; this suggests chemical adsorption of the nanoparticles rather than merely physical adsorption. A remarkable near five&#8208;fold increase in &#915; is observed for ca. 50&#8197;nm epoxy&#8208;functional nanoparticles compared to non&#8208;functional nanoparticles (31.3 vs. 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively). Tribological studies confirm that chemical adsorption of the latter epoxy&#8208;functional nanoparticles leads to a significant reduction in friction between 60&#8201;&#176;C and 120&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>De&#8208;Linker&#8208;Enabled Exceptional Volumetric Acetylene Storage Capacity and Benchmark C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benchmark acetylene adsorbents come to existence via novel cluster&#8208;cluster&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks designed by a de&#8208;linker strategy and are capable of reaching the highest acetylene storage capacity, top&#8208;level IAST selectivity, benchmark breakthrough interval time, and extraordinary productivity for C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures.







Abstract
An ideal adsorbent for separation requires optimizing both storage capacity and selectivity, but maximizing both or achieving a desired balance remain challenging. Herein, a de&#8208;linker strategy is proposed to address this issue for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Broadly speaking, the de&#8208;linker idea targets a class of materials that may be viewed as being intermediate between zeolites and MOFs. Its feasibility is shown here by a series of ultra&#8208;microporous MOFs (SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;M, M=Mn, Co, Ni, Zn). SNNU&#8208;98 exhibit high volumetric C2H2 uptake capacity under low and ambient pressures (175.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 @ 0.1&#8197;bar, 222.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 @ 1&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), as well as extraordinary selectivity (2405.7 for C2H2/C2H4, 22.7 for C2H2/CO2). Remarkably, SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;Mn can efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with a benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) breakthrough time of 2325&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1, and produce 99.9999&#8201;% C2H4 with a productivity up to 64.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing values of reported MOF adsorbents.

&lt;p&gt;Benchmark acetylene adsorbents come to existence via novel cluster-cluster-type metal&#8211;organic frameworks designed by a de-linker strategy and are capable of reaching the highest acetylene storage capacity, top-level IAST selectivity, benchmark breakthrough interval time, and extraordinary productivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal adsorbent for separation requires optimizing both storage capacity and selectivity, but maximizing both or achieving a desired balance remain challenging. Herein, a de-linker strategy is proposed to address this issue for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Broadly speaking, the de-linker idea targets a class of materials that may be viewed as being intermediate between zeolites and MOFs. Its feasibility is shown here by a series of ultra-microporous MOFs (SNNU-98-M, M=Mn, Co, Ni, Zn). SNNU-98 exhibit high volumetric C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity under low and ambient pressures (175.3&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; @ 0.1&#8197;bar, 222.9&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; @ 1&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), as well as extraordinary selectivity (2405.7 for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 22.7 for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Remarkably, SNNU-98-Mn can efficiently separate C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures with a benchmark C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1/99) breakthrough time of 2325&#8197;min&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and produce 99.9999&#8201;% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a productivity up to 64.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing values of reported MOF adsorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transient and Dissipative Host&#8211;Guest Hydrogels Regulated by Consumption of a Reactive Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to prepare hydrogels relies on consumption of a chemical fuel to transiently drive network crosslinking by host&#8211;guest motifs, thereby prompting hydrogelation. The temporary nature of this fuel&#8208;directed change in the interacting molecules causes the gels that are formed from this fuel to have a limited lifetime, autonomously converting back to their original pre&#8208;gel state over time without additional user input. Details of the study are reported by Matthew&#8197;J. Webber et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216537).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Lengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of multidentate ligands is made to successfully construct metal&#8208;backboned polymers with well&#8208;defined lengths and excellent optical, electrochemical, thermal and solution properties, representing a general and effective strategy to the creation of a new type of functional polymers.







Abstract
Constructing the backbones of polymers with metal atoms is an attractive strategy to develop new functional polymeric materials, but it has yet to be studied due to synthetic challenges. Here, metal atoms are interconnected as the backbones of polymers to yield metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs). Rational design of multidentate ligands synthesized via an efficient iterative approach leads to the successful construction of a series of nickel&#8208;backboned polymers (NBPs) with well&#8208;defined lengths and up to 21 nickel atoms, whose structures are systematically confirmed. These NBPs exhibit strong and length&#8208;depended absorption with narrow band gaps, offering promising applications in optoelectronic devices and semiconductors. We also demonstrate the high thermal stability and solution processsability of such nickel&#8208;backboned polymers. Our results represent a new opportunity to design and synthesize a variety of new metal&#8208;backboned polymers for promising applications in the future.

         <title>Guanidine Additive Enabled Intermolecular ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde&#8208;Amine&#8208;Thiol Three&#8208;Component Reactions for Modular Constructions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reaction were realized through the use of a guanidine additive. This method enables the construction of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates in a modular fashion, and it is anticipated that it will open up new and diverse opportunities to access new conjugate structures for chemical biology, medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.







Abstract
Recently, ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) is experiencing a renascence for the modification of proteins and peptides through OPA&#8208;amine two&#8208;component reactions for bioconjugation and intramolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reactions for cyclization. Historically, small thiol molecules were used in large excess to allow for the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol reaction forming 1&#8208;thio&#8208;isoindole derivatives. In this study, we discovered that guanidine could serve as an effective additive to switch the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reaction to a stoichiometric process and enable the modular construction of peptide&#8208;peptide, and peptide&#8208;drug conjugate structures. Thus, 12 model peptide&#8208;peptide conjugates have been synthesized from unprotected peptides featuring all proteinogenic residues. Besides, 6 peptide&#8208;drug conjugates have been prepared in one step, with excellent conversions and isolated yields. In addition, a conjugate product has been further functionalized by utilizing a premodified OPA derivative, demonstrating the versatility and flexibility of this reaction.

         <title>Discovering the Intrinsic Causes of Dendrite Formation in Zinc Metal Anodes: Lattice Defects and Residual Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a highly stable and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode is essential to the commercial application of zinc metal batteries. However, the understanding of zinc dendrites formation mechanism is still insufficient. Herein, for the first time, we discover that the interfacial heterogeneous deposition induced by lattice defects and epitaxial growth limited by residual stress are intrinsic and critical causes for zinc dendrite formation. Therefore, an annealing reconstruction strategy was proposed to eliminate lattice defects and stresses in zinc crystals, which achieve dense epitaxial electrodeposition of zinc anode. The as&#8208;prepared annealed zinc anodes exhibit dendrite&#8208;free morphology and enhanced electrochemical cycling stability. This work first proves that lattice defects and residual stresses are also very important factors for epitaxial electrodeposition of zinc in addition to crystal orientation, which can provide a new mechanism for future researches on zinc anode modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Asymmetric Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Electronically Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diarylation of electronically unactivated alkenes has emerged as an extensive research topic in organic synthesis. However, most examples are mainly limited to terminal alkenes. Furthermore, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated alkenes still remains unsolved and is a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a highly efficient directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes with high diastereoselectivities. More importantly, our further effort towards enantioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of the unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes is achieved, furnishing various polyarylalkanes featuring benzylic stereocenters in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities and high diastereoselectivities. Interestingly, the generation of cationic Ni&#8208;catalyst by adding alkali metal fluoride is the key to increased efficiency of this enantioselective reaction.</dc:description>

More importantly, our further effort towards enantioselective 1,2-diarylation of the unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes is achieved, furnishing various polyarylalkanes featuring benzylic stereocenters in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities and high diastereoselectivities. Interestingly, the generation of cationic Ni-catalyst by adding alkali metal fluoride is the key to increased efficiency of this enantioselective reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Enhancement and Quenching in Single&#8208;Molecule Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite intensive research in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), the influence mechanism of chemical effects on Raman signals remains elusive. Here, we investigate such chemical effects through tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) of a single planar ZnPc molecule with varying but controlled contact environments. TERS signals are found dramatically enhanced upon making a tip&#8211;molecule point contact. A combined physico&#8208;chemical mechanism is proposed to explain such an enhancement via the generation of a ground&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer induced vertical Raman polarizability that is further enhanced by the strong vertical plasmonic field in the nanocavity. In contrast, TERS signals from ZnPc chemisorbed flatly on substrates are found strongly quenched, which is rationalized by the Raman polarizability screening effect induced by interfacial dynamic charge transfer. Our results provide deep insights into the understanding of the chemical effects in TERS/SERS enhancement and quenching.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore&#8208;Environment&#8208;Dependent Photoresponsive Oxidase&#8208;like Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking the bioactivity of native enzymes through synthetic chemistry is an efficient means to advance the biocatalysts in a cell&#8208;free environment, however, remains long&#8208;standing challenges. Herein, we utilize structurally explicit hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to mimic photo&#8208;responsive oxidase, and uncover the important role of pore environments on mediating oxidase&#8208;like activity by means of constructing isostructural HOFs. We discover that the HOF pore with suitable geometry can stabilize and spatially organize the catalytic substrate into a favorable catalytic route, as with the function of the native enzyme pocket. Based on the desirable photo&#8208;responsive oxidase&#8208;like activity, a visual and sensitive HOFs biosensor is established for the detection of phosphatase, an important biomarker of skeletal and hepatobiliary diseases. This work demonstrates that the pore environments significantly influence the nanozymes&#8217; activity in addition to the active center.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Determination and Chemical Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycan from the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asparagine&#8208;linked protein glycosylations (N&#8208;glycosylations) are one of the most abundant post&#8208;translational modifications and are essential for various biological phenomena. In this study, we achieved the isolation, structural determination, and chemical synthesis of N&#8208;glycan from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis. The N&#8208;glycan from the organism possesses a unique structure including myo&#8208;inositol, which has not been found in previously characterized N&#8208;glycans. In this structure, myo&#8208;inositol is highly glycosylated and linked with a disaccharide unit through a phosphodiester. The straightforward synthesis of this glycan was accomplished via diastereoselective phosphorylation and phosphodiester construction by SN2 coupling. Considering the early divergence of hyperthermophilic organisms in evolution, this study can be expected to open the door to approaching the primitive function of glycan modification at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering Stabilizes Rhombohedral Sodium Manganese Hexacyanoferrates for High&#8208;Energy Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rhombohedral sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) only containing cheap Fe and Mn metals was regarded as a scalable, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy cathode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the unexpected Jahn&#8208;teller effect and significant phase transformation would cause Mn dissolution and anisotropic volume change, thus leading to capacity loss and structural instability. Here we report a simple room&#8208;temperature route to construct a magical CoxB skin on the surface of MnHCF. Benefited from the complete coverage and the buffer effect of CoxB layer, the modified MnHCF cathode exhibits suppressed Mn dissolution and reduced intergranular cracks inside particles, thereby demonstrating thousands&#8208;cycle level cycling lifespan. By comparing two key parameters in the real energy world, i.e., cost per kilowatt&#8208;hours and cost per cycle&#8208;life, our developed CoxB coated MnHCF cathode demonstrates more competitive application potential than the benchmarking LiFePO4 for Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as a Selective Molecular Trap for LiF/[BeF]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion of ionic compounds into open&#8208;cage fullerenes is a challenging task due to the electron positive nature of the cavity. The present work reports the preparation of an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative with a hydroxyl group pointing towards the centre of the cavity, which can coordinate to a metal cation, thus acting as a bait/hook to trap the metal cation such as the lithium cation in neutral LiF and the beryllium cation in the cationic [BeF]+ species. Other metal salts could not be inserted under similar conditions. The structure of MF in the cage was unambiguously determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Owing to its polycoordination tendency, Li+ monomer salt has not yet been isolated before in spite of extensive research on Li&#8208;bond. The present results provide a unique example of Li&#8208;bond.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Observation of Porosity Formation in Porous Single&#8208;crystalline TiO2 Monolith for Enhanced and Stable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing pores in single crystals creates a new type of porous materials that incorporate porosity and structural coherence. Herein, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy to disclose the porosity formation by converting KTiOPO4 (KTP) single crystals into porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) TiO2 monoliths in a solid&#8208;solid transformation. The isolated crystalline nuclei of TiO2 clusters with identical lattice orientation on KTP surface moves TiO2/KTP interface toward mother phase for growing PSC TiO2 monoliths. The relative density in PSC TiO2 monoliths dominates porosity while the macroscopic dimensions remain unchanged in the transformation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of porous architecture stabilizes oxygen vacancy to activate lattice oxygen while the three&#8208;dimensional percolation enhances species diffusion. PSC TiO2 monoliths with deposited Pt clusters show enhanced and stable catalytic CO oxidation in air at ~75 &#176;C for 200 hours of operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular mechanisms behind acetylene selectivity in functional porous materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its first industrial production in 1890s, acetylene has played a vital role in manufacturing a wide spectrum of materials. Although current methods and infrastructures for various segments of acetylene industries are well&#8208;established, with emerging functional porous materials that enabled desired selectivity toward target molecules, it is of timely interests to develop new efficient technologies to promote safer acetylene processes with higher energy efficiency and lower carbon footprint. In this mini&#8208;review, we, from the perspective of materials chemistry, review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8208;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. We also discuss the challenges on the roadmap of translational research in the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlight areas which require future research efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Roles of Polymers in Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials: Modulation of Intersystem Crossing, Air Sensitivity and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials routinely incorporate polymeric components, which usually act as non&#8208;functional or &#8220;inert&#8221; media to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from thermal and collisional quenching, but are lesser explored for other influences. Here, we report some exemplary &#8220;active roles&#8221; of polymer matrices played in organic RTP materials, including: 1) color modulation of total delayed emissions via balancing the population ratio between thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and RTP due to dielectric&#8208;dependent intersystem crossing; 2) altered air sensitivity of RTP materials by generating various surface morphologies such as nano&#8208;sized granules; 3) enhanced bacterial elimination for enhanced electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bio&#8208;membranes. These active roles demonstrated that the vast library of polymeric structures and functionalities can be married to organic phosphors to broaden new application horizons for RTP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>ATP&#8208;independent and cell&#8208;free biosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids using vinyl esters as smart substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vitro biosynthetic pathways that condense and reduce molecules through coenzyme A (CoASH) activation demand energy and redox power in the form of ATP and NAD(P)H, respectively. These coenzymes must be orthogonally recycled by ancillary reactions that consume chemicals, electricity, or light, impacting the atom economy and/or the energy consumption of the biosystem. In this work, we have exploited vinyl esters as dual acyl and electron donor substrates to synthesize &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids through a non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, reduction and hydrolysis stepwise cascade, including a NADH recycling step, catalyzed by a total of 4 enzymes. Herein, the chemical energy to activate the acyl group with CoASH and the redox power for the reduction are embedded into the vinyl esters. Upon optimization, this self&#8208;sustaining cascade reached a titer of 3&#8208;hydroxy butyrate of 24 mM without requiring ATP and simultaneously recycling CoASH and NADH. This work illustrates the potential of in vitro biocatalysis to transform simple molecules into multi&#8208;functional ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Supramolecular A8Bn Miktoarm Star Copolymers by Host&#8211;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a brand&#8208;new synthetic method to construct supramolecular A8Bn&#160;(n = 1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers via host&#8211;guest complexation between a resorcinarene&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene chains and 4,4&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl guest molecules keeping one, two and four polymethyl acrylate chains. The formation of the supramolecular A8Bn&#160;(n = 1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers was confirmed by dynamic light scattering&#160;(DLS), size exclusion chromatography&#160;(SEC), and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy&#160;(DOSY). Differential scanning calorimetry&#160;(DSC)&#160;measurements revealed that the miktoarm copolymers were phase&#8208;separated in bulk. The micro Brownian motion of the capsule surrounded by polymethyl acrylate arms and polystyrene arms in the A8B4&#160;structure was markedly enhanced in bulk due to a weak&#160;segregation&#160;interaction between the immiscible arms.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiroborate&#8208;Based Host Materials with High Triplet Energies and Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transport Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) receive considerable attention because of their commercial use in flat panel displays. Herein, highly efficient spiroborate&#8208;based host materials are reported for use in blue OLEDs. Our designed spiroborates (SBOX) were simple to synthesize and exhibited high triplet excitation energies, narrow S&#8208;T gaps, and balanced charge carrier mobilities. A blue OLED containing one of the designed spiroborates, SBON, as a host exhibited a high external quantum efficiency (27.6%) and low turn&#8208;on voltage (3.7 V) compared to those observed using 3,3&#697;&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#697;&#8208;biphenyl (17.6% and 4.5 V, respectively), indicating their potential as host materials in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Semiconductor SERS on Colourful Substrates with Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;metallic materials have emerged as a new family of active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), with unique advantages over their metal counterparts. However, owing to their inefficient interaction with the incident wavelength, the Raman enhancement achieved with non&#8208;metallic materials is considerably lower with respect to the metallic ones. Herein, we propose colourful semiconductor&#8208;based SERS substrates for the first time by utilizing a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity, which realize a large freedom in manipulating light. Owing to the delicate adjustment of the absorption in terms of both frequency and intensity, resonant absorption can be achieved with a variety of non&#8208;metal SERS substrates, with the sensitivity further enhanced by ~100 times. As a typical example, by introducing a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot&#8208;type substrate fabricated with SiO2/Si, a rather low detection limit of 10&#8722;16 M for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2S protein is achieved on SnS2. This study provides a realistic strategy for increasing SERS sensitivity when semiconductors are employed as SERS substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin and Rein of Interface Fusion during Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interface fusion plays a key role in constructing Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal cathodes, and is governed by the atomic migration related to kinetics. However, the interfacial atom migration path and its control factors are lack of clearly understanding. Herein, we systematically probe the solid&#8208;state synthesis mechanism of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, including the effects of precursor size, Li/transition metal (TM) ratio and sintering temperature on the structure. Multi&#8208;dimensional analysis unravels that thermodynamics drives interface atoms migration through intermediate state (i.e., cation mixing phase) to induce grain boundary fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller precursor size (&lt; 6 &#956;m), lager Li/TM ratio (&gt; 1.0) and higher temperature (&#8805; 810 &#8451;) are conducive to promote the growth of the intermediate state due to reaction kinetics enhancement, and ultimately strengthen the atomic migration&#8208;induced interface fusion.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxodicarbonate as a Green Oxidizer for the Selective Degradation of Kraft Lignin into Vanillin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin, the world&#8217;s largest resource of renewable aromatics, with annually roughly 50 million tons of accruing technical lignin, mainly Kraft lignin, is highly underdeveloped regarding the production of monoaromatics. We demonstrate the oxidative depolymerization of Kraft lignin at 180 &#176;C to produce vanillin 1 in yields up to 6.2 wt% and 92% referred to the maximum yield gained from the quantification reaction utilizing nitrobenzene. Using peroxo&#173;dicarbonate (C2O62&#8722;) as &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation, toxic and/or harmful reagents are prevented. Also, the formed waste can serve as makeup chemical in the pulping process. Na2C2O6 is synthesized in an ex&#8208;cell electrolysis of aqueous Na2CO3 at BDD anodes, achieving a yield of Na2C2O6 with 41%. At least, the oxidation and degradation of Kraft lignin is analysis via UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

We demonstrate the oxidative depolymerization of Kraft lignin at 180 &#176;C to produce vanillin 1 in yields up to 6.2 wt% and 92% referred to the maximum yield gained from the quantification reaction utilizing nitrobenzene. Using peroxo&#173;dicarbonate (C2O62&#8722;) as &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation, toxic and/or harmful reagents are prevented. Also, the formed waste can serve as makeup chemical in the pulping process. Na2C2O6 is synthesized in an ex-cell electrolysis of aqueous Na2CO3 at BDD anodes, achieving a yield of Na2C2O6 with 41%. At least, the oxidation and degradation of Kraft lignin is analysis via UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2 Aggregation on Monoethanolamine: Observation from Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The initial stages of the gas&#8208;phase nucleation between CO2 and monoethanolamine were investigated via broadband rotational spectroscopy with the aid of extensive theoretical structure sampling. Sub&#8208;nanometer scale aggregation patterns of monoethanolamine&#8208;(CO2)n, n = 1&#8208;4, were identified. An interesting competition between the monoethanolamine intramolecular hydrogen bond and the intermolecular interactions between monoethanolamine and CO2 upon cluster growth was discovered, revealing an intriguing CO2&#160;binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. These findings are in sharp contrast to the general results for aqueous solutions. In the quinary complex, a cap&#8208;like CO2 tetramer was observed cooperatively surrounding the monoethanolamine. As the cluster approaches the critical size of new particle formation, the contribution of CO2&#160;self&#8208;assembly to the overall stability increases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8208;) has long been used as a spectator counter anion. Herein, we report an unprecedented salt metathesis between a variety of BF4&#8208; salts and a series of organoboronic acids yielding the corresponding organotrifluoroborates. We identified conditions for fast and efficient fluoridation (&lt;1 h) with minimal workup.

         <title>A Bidentate Ligand Featuring Ditopic Lewis Acids in the Second Sphere for Selective Substrate Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a ligand platform featuring appended ditopic Lewis acids to facilitate capture/activation of diatomic substrates. We show that incorporation of two 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN) units on a single carbon tethered to a pyridine pyrazole scaffold maintains a set of unquenched nitrogen donors available to coordinate Fe(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II). Using hydride ion affinity and competition experiments, we establish an additive effect for ditopic secondary sphere boranes, compared to the monotopic analogue. These effects are exploited to achieve high selectivity for binding NO2&#8208; in the presence of competitive anions such as F&#8208; and NO3&#8208;. Finally, we demonstrate hydrazine capture within the second&#8208;sphere of metal complexes, followed by unique activation pathways to generate hydrazido and diazene ligands on Zn and Fe, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast One&#8208;Handed Helix Induction and Its Static Helicity Memory in a Poly(biphenylylacetylene) with a Catalytic Amount of Chiral Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and subsequent static helicity memory in poly(biphenylylacetylene) (PBPA&#8208;A) assisted by a catalytic amount of nonracemic ammonium salts comprised of non&#8208;coordinating tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (BArF&#8211;) as a counter anion. The remarkable acceleration of the helix&#8208;induction rate in PBPA&#8208;A accompanied by the significant amplification of the asymmetry relies on the two methoxymethoxy groups&#160;of the biphenyl pendants, which can gain access to enfold the chiral ammoniums in a crown&#8208;ether manner in specific aromatic solvents, leading to ultra&#8208;fast helicity induction, which is completed within 30 sec. In aromatic solvents, helicity memory is lost rapidly, but is quite stable in long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. The best use of specific solvents for helicity induction and&#160;static helicity memory, respectively, provides a highly sensitive chirality sensing system toward a small amount of chiral amines and amino acids when complexed with BArF&#8211;.</dc:description>

The &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters can be chemoselectively coupled with allyl electrophiles, affording a diverse set of enantioenriched (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;dienes in good yields, with excellent stereoselectivity. By permuting the chiral iridium catalysts and the substrates, we efficiently and selectively obtained all four stereoisomers bearing two consecutive chiral centers. Mechanistic studies via density functional theory calculations revealed the origins of the diastereo&#8208; and chemoselectivities, indicating the pivotal roles of the steric interaction, the &#946;&#8208;silicon effect, and a rapid desilylation process.

         <title>Antibacterial Nanomaterials:&#160;Mechanisms, Impacts on Antimicrobial Resistance and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to the environment and health. AMR rapidly invalidates conventional antibiotics, and antimicrobial nanomaterials have been increasingly explored as alternatives. Interestingly, several antimicrobial nanomaterials show AMR&#8208;independent antimicrobial effects without detectable new resistance and have therefore been suggested to prevent AMR evolution. In contrast, some are found to trigger the evolution of AMR. Given these seemingly conflicting findings, a timely discussion of the two faces of antimicrobial nanomaterials is urgently needed. This review systematically compares the killing mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships of antibiotics and antimicrobial nanomaterials. We then focus on nano&#8208;microbe interactions to elucidate the impacts of molecular initiating events on AMR evolution. Finally, we provide an outlook on future antimicrobial nanomaterials and propose design principles for the prevention of AMR evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Medium&#8208;Ring Strategy Enables Multiple Resonance Emitters with Twisted Geometry and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip to Suppress Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and reducing device efficiency roll&#8208;off are both crucial yet challenging for multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters. Herein, we put forward a medium&#8208;ring strategy to design efficient MR emitters that feature heptagonal tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) donors. The highly twisted conformation enlarges the intermolecular distances between the MR&#8208;emitting cores, and thus suppresses ACQ effect. Meanwhile, the introduction of heptagonal donors enhances spin&#8208;orbital coupling, so as to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This medium&#8208;ring strategy gives rise to the first example of blue MR emitter that simultaneously possesses radiative decay rate as fast as 108 s&#8208;1 and RISC rate as fast as 106 s&#8208;1. Accordingly, DTBA&#8208;B2N3 enables to assemble high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.9% and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 20.5%).</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze&#160;Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8210;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of C(sp3)&#8210;H bonds is appealing for synthetic applications due to the biocompatibility and high earth abundance of iron, but examples of such reactions are sparse. Herein we describe chiral iron complexes of meso&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;porphyrins that can catalyze asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8210;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to afford chiral indolines (29 examples) and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides (17 examples) with up to 93% ee (yield: up to 99%) upon 410 nm LED light irradiation under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculations for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO2Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp3)&#8210;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO2Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Induced Conversion of a Self&#8208;Assembled Gyrobifastigium to a Barrel and Encapsulation of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine within the Barrel for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rare gyrobifastigium architecture (GB) was constructed by self&#8208;assembly of a tetradentate donor (L) with Pd(II) acceptor in DMSO. The GB was converted to its isomeric tetragonal barrel (MB) upon treatment with water. The hydrophobic cavity of MB has been explored for the encapsulation of zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), which is an excellent photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the poor water&#8208;solubility and aggregation tendency are the main reasons for the suboptimal PDT performance of free ZnPc in the aqueous medium. Effective solubilization of ZnPc in an aqueous medium was achieved by encapsulating it in the cavity of MB. The inclusion complex (ZnPc&#8834;MB) showed enhanced singlet oxygen generation in water. Higher cellular uptake and anticancer activity of the ZnPc&#8834;MB compared to free ZnPc on HeLa cells indicate that encapsulation of ZnPc in an aqueous host is a potential strategy for enhancement of its PDT activity in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Influencing Factors on Li&#8208;ion Conductivity and Interfacial Stability of Solid Polymer Electrolytes, Exampled by Polycarbonates, Polyoxalates and Polymalonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) batteries is hindered by lower Li+&#8208;conductivity and narrower electrochemical window. Here, three families of ester&#8208;based F&#8208;modified SPEs of poly&#8208;carbonate (PCE), poly&#8208;oxalate (POE) and poly&#8208;malonate (PME) were investigated. The Li+&#8208;conductivity of these SPEs prepared from pentanediol are all higher than the counterparts made of butanediol, owing to the enhanced asymmetry and flexibility. Because of stronger chelating coordination with Li+, the Li+&#8208;conductivity of PME and POE is around 10 and 5 times of PCE. The trifluoroacetyl&#8208;units are observed more effective than &#8208;O&#8208;CH2&#8208;CF2&#8208;CF2&#8208;CH2&#8208;O&#8208; during the in&#8208;situ passivation of Li&#8208;metal. Using trifluoroacetyl terminated POE and PCE as SPE, the interfaces with Li&#8208;metal and high&#8208;voltage&#8208;cathode are stabilized simultaneously, endowing stable cycling of ASS Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells. Owing to an enol isomerization of malonate, the cycling stability of Li/PME/NCM622 is deteriorated, which is recovered with the introduce of dimethyl&#8208;group in malonate and the suppression of enol isomerization. The coordinating capability with Li+, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F, are all critical for the molecular design of SPEs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>TTwo new ring expansion strategies are reported for the synthesis of medium sized ring and macrocyclic sulfonamides. Both methods can be performed without using classical protecting groups, with the key ring expansion step initiated by nitro reduction and amine conjugate addition respectively.

         <title>Bending actuation of hydrogels through rotation of light&#8208;driven molecular motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unidirectional rotation of chemically crosslinked light&#8208;driven molecular motors is shown to progressively shift the swelling equilibrium of hydrogels. The concentration of molecular motors and the initial strand density of the polymer network are key parameters to modulate the macroscopic contraction of the material, and both parameters can be tuned using polymer chains of different molecular weights. These findings led to the design of optimized hydrogels revealing a half&#8208;time contraction of approximately 5 min. Furthermore, under inhomogeneous stimulation, the local contraction event was exploited to design useful bending actuators with an energy output 400 times higher than for previously reported self&#8208;assembled systems involving rotary motors. In the present configuration, we measure that a single molecular motor can lift up loads of 200 times its own molecular weight.</dc:description>

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Cas Biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;Based Molecular Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#8208;based nucleic acid testing has played a critical role in disease diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and many more. However, this method requires a long turnaround time, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, limiting its widespread availability and diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has recently demonstrated capability for nucleic acid detection with high sensitivity and specificity. CRISPR&#8208;mediated biosensing holds great promise for revolutionizing nucleic acid testing procedures and developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based nucleic acid testing has played a critical role in disease diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and many more. However, this method requires a long turnaround time, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, limiting its widespread availability and diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has recently demonstrated capability for nucleic acid detection with high sensitivity and specificity. CRISPR-mediated biosensing holds great promise for revolutionizing nucleic acid testing procedures and developing point-of-care diagnostics. This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection techniques. Four ongoing research hotspots in molecular diagnostics&#8211;target preamplification-free detection, microRNA (miRNA) detection, non-nucleic-acid detection, and SARS-CoV-2 detection&#8211;are also covered&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Probing and Identification of Electrochemical Reaction Intermediates by Floating Electrolytic Electrospray Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth study of electrochemical (EC) synthesis can require a powerful mass spectrometry (MS) analytical platform which can discover and identify fleeting intermediates in EC reactions. Here we report a floating electrolytic electrospray ionization (FE&#8208;ESI) strategy that can perform EC process in a floating electrolytic cell and monitor intermediates by high&#8208;resolution MS. Compared with previous EC&#8208;MS methods, a significant advantage of FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS is it allows one to modulate the electrolytic and electrospray process individually, ensuring its high sensitivity in discovering intermediate and universality to investigate redox reactions in different scenarios. This powerful platform had been successfully used to investigate EC reductive coupling of p&#8208;tolylboronic acid and p&#8208;nitrotoluene. A series of nitrene intermediates were discovered and identified by FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, indicating a hidden mechanism involving nitrene formation might play key role in EC reductive coupling process.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Heterometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets Incorporating Four Lanthanoceniums</title>

         <dc:description>The syntheses and magnetic properties of organometallic heterometallic compounds [K(THF)6]{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (1&#8208;RE) and [K(Crypt)]2{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (2&#8208;RE) containing hexaazatrinaphthylene radicals (HAN &#183; 3&#8208;) and four rare earth (RE) ions are reported. 1&#8208;RE shows isolable species with ligand&#8208;based mixed valency as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) thus leading to the isolation of 2&#8208;RE via one&#8208;electron chemical reduction. Strong electronic communication in mixed&#8208;valency supports stronger overall ferromagnetic behaviors in 2&#8208;RE than 1&#8208;RE containing Gd and Dy ions. Ac magnetic susceptibility data reveal 1&#8208;Dy and 2&#8208;Dy both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation. Importantly, larger coercive field was observed in the hysteresis of 2&#8208;Dy at 2.0 K, indicating the enhanced SMM behavior compared with 1&#8208;Dy. Ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valency strategy has been used for the first time to improve the magnetic coupling in lanthanide (Ln) SMMs, thus opening up new ways to construct strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazo[1,2&#8208;B]indazoles: Straightforward Access to Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Polyaromatics from s&#8208;Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported. Starting from readily available fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine, a cyclization process with azide leads to the formation of an unprecedented tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole or a bis&#8208;tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole (cis and trans). Based on the new nitrogen core, further N&#8208;directed palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8211;H bond functionalization allows the introduction of halides or acetates. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were studied by a joint experimental/theoretical approach. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state p&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential,absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A Transformable and Bulky Methacrylate Monomer That Enables the Synthesis of an MMA&#8208;nBA Alternating Copolymer: Sequence&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed a methacrylate molecule with an alkyl&#8208;substituted trichloro salicylic acid pendant as a transformable bulky monomer to enable the synthesis of an alternating copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA). The adamantyl&#8208;substituted methacrylate monomer (1&#8208;Ad) showed very low homopolymerization propensity in radical polymerizations, but afforded the alternating copolymer with nBA via copolymerization. The 1&#8208;Ad units in the resultant copolymer were quantitatively and selectively transformed into MMA via transesterification with methanol to yield the alternating copolymer of MMA and nBA. Its alternating sequence was clearly demonstrated by a structural analysis via 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as the low reactivity ratios for the 1&#8208;Ad and nBA pair. Finally, we verified the superior self&#8208;healing ability of the alternating copolymer compared to that of the corresponding 1:1 statistical copolymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplification of Lipid Peroxidation by Regulating Cell Membrane Unsaturation to Enhance Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is one of the most damaging processes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although it is well known that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are much more susceptible than saturated or monounsaturated ones to LPO, there is no study exploring the effect of cell membrane unsaturation degree on CDT. Here, we report a self&#8208;reinforcing CDT agent (denoted as OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs), consisting of oleanolic acid (OA)&#8208;loaded iron single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC)&#8208;embedded hollow carbon nanosphere encapsulated by erythrocyte membrane (EM), which promotes LPO to improve chemodynamic efficacy via modulating the degree of membrane unsaturation. Upon uptake of OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs by cancer cells, Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed conversion of endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, in addition to initiating chemodynamic therapeutic process, causes the dissociation of EM shell and the ensuing release of OA that can enrich cellular membranes with PUFAs, enabling LPO amplification&#8208;enhanced CDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Boranes Paving the Way to Anionic Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First examples of anionic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs) that contain borane substituents have been synthesized. The nature of the borane substituents allows a modulation of the &#963;&#8208;donor or &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities compared to their neutral analogues. A B(CN)3&#8208;substituted Ani&#8208;cAAC has been generated and used in situ. The corresponding C2F5BF2&#8208;Ani&#8208;cAAC&#160;6&#160;was ob&#173;tain&#173;ed in high yield on a multi&#8208;gram scale. First reactions of these novel ligands with elemental sele&#173;nium and chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) led to the ani&#173;onic selenium adducts&#160;7&#160;and&#160;8&#160;and the Ani&#8208;cAAC gold complex&#160;9. The properties of these compounds and data derived from theoretical calculations provide an insight into the electronic and steric properties of these novel anionic cAACs. Especially the ease of synthesis and the combination of properties such as negative charge, large buried volume, and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability renders Ani&#8208;cAACs unique and promising new building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Switchable Selective Oxidations of Styrene Over Covalent Triazine Frameworks in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using photocatalytic oxidation to convert basic chemicals into high value compounds in environmentally benign reaction media is a current focus in catalytic research. The challenge lies at gaining controllability over product formation selectivity. Herein, we design covalent triazine frameworks as heterogeneous, metal&#8208;free and recyclable photocatalysts for visible light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. The product formation selectivity was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species. Using the same photocatalyst, by deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99% conversion and over 99% selectivity as single product. The highly challenging and sensitive epoxidation reaction of styrene was carried out by creating peroxymonocarbonate as initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate, which led to a formation of styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76% with nearly quantitative conversion. This study demonstrates a preliminary yet interesting example for simple control over switchable product formation selectivity for challenging oxidation reactions of organic compounds in pure water.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Novel Plasticizers by Direct Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Di&#8208; or Multi&#8208;carbonylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first di&#8208; and multi&#8208;carbonylations of olefins with di&#8208; or polyols provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of di&#8208; or multiesters with high efficiency and selectivity. Representative diesters show potential performance (Tg) as novel plasticizers.







Abstract
Diesters are of fundamental importance in the chemical industry and are used for many applications, e.g. as plasticizers, surfactants, emulsifiers, and lubricants. Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient method for the selective synthesis of diesters via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct carbonylation of di&#8208; or polyols with readily available alkenes. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success is the use of a specific palladium catalyst with the &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8208;base&#8221; ligand L16 providing esterification of all alcohols and a high n/iso ratio. The synthesized diesters were evaluated as potential plasticizers in PVC films by measuring the glass transition temperature (Tg) via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

         <title>Unusual Changes of C&#8722;H Bond Lengths in Chiral Zinc Complexes Induced by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution neutron diffraction studies have been successfully performed on chiral complexes to observe C&#8722;H bond elongations and shortenings caused by three types of tetrel bonds (TBs) and a trifurcated improper hydrogen bond, respectively. This study helps to fundamentally understand uncommon and subtle C&#8722;H bond changes induced by weak interactions.







Abstract
In order to better understand the effect of non&#8208;covalent weak interactions on molecules, we have explored a variety of weak interactions, such as improper H&#8208;bonding (HB), tetrel bonds (TBs) and halogen bonds, in fluorinated chiral zinc complexes. High resolution neutron diffraction studies revealed a methylene carbon&#8208;hydrogen bond elongation and shortening due to TB and improper HB interactions, respectively. To show the accumulative effects of multiple weak interactions on the C&#8722;H bond, three types of tetrel bonds have been carefully examined. We have also shown how C&#8722;H bond elongation can be easily offset by forming an improper HB with the H atom from this C&#8722;H bond. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and electrostatic potential analysis investigations have been used to affirm the nature of the interactions based on density functional theory (DFT) and other related calculations.

         <title>Optical Spin Polarization of a Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Electron&#8208;Spin Qubit in a Chromophore/Stable&#8208;Radical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach to molecular qubits employs a photoexcited chromophore covalently linked to a deuterated stable radical (C&#8722;R&#8901;). Photoexcitation of the C within C&#8722;R&#8901; results in ultrafast intersystem crossing to produce the spin&#8208;polarized quartet state (Q) that decays to the spin&#8208;polarized ground state (D0). Both Q and D0 have narrow linewidths that allow facile addressability using microwave pulses.







Abstract
Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to stable radicals can serve as qubit and/or qudit candidates for quantum information applications. 1,6,7,12&#8208;Tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy)&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4&#8201;:&#8201;9,10&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) linked to a partially deuterated &#945;,&#947;&#8208;bisdiphenylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylallyl radical (BDPA&#8208;d16) was synthesized and characterized by time&#8208;resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Photoexcitation of tpPDI&#8208;BDPA&#8208;d16 results in ultrafast radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing to produce a quartet state (Q) followed by formation of a spin&#8208;polarized doublet ground state (D0). Pulse&#8208;EPR experiments confirmed the spin multiplicity of Q and yielded coherence times of Tm=2.1&#177;0.1&#8197;&#956;s and 2.8&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;s for Q and D0, respectively. BDPA&#8208;d16 eliminates the dominant 1H hyperfine couplings, resulting in a single narrow line for both the Q and D0 states, which enhances the spectral resolution needed for good qubit addressability.

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Organic Photonic Synapses for Selective Detection of SWIR Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the color recognition function of the retina, an artificial photonic synapse, based on a novel narrow&#8208;band gap polymer P1 and PC71BM, with unprecedentedly selective response to short wavelength infrared (SWIR) light is reported, which realized letter imaging and memory with noise reduction function. This work has the potential to broaden the range of artificial visual systems and facilitate the coupling of neuromorphic computing with optical communication.







Abstract
Photonic synapses with the dual function of optical signal detection and information processing can simulate human visual system. However, photonic synapses with selective detection of short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light have never been reported, which can not only broaden the human vision region but also integrate neuromorphic computation and infrared optical communication. Here, organic photonic synapses based on a new donor&#8208;acceptor copolymer P1 are fabricated, which exhibit excellent synaptic characteristics with selective detection for SWIR and extremely low energy consumption (2.85&#8201;fJ). The working mechanism is rooted in energy level barriers and unbalanced charge transportation. Moreover, these photonic synapses demonstrate excellent performance in multi&#8208;signal logic editing, letter imaging and memory with noise reduction function. This contribution provides ideas of constructing selective&#8208;response synapses for artificial visual system and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Strong Coupling of Chiral Frenkel Exciton for Intense, Bisignate Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly coupled chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08, measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregate bundles. The bisignate, highly correlated dissymmetry factors in absorption gabs and in emission glum reveal a small Davydov splitting of the excited states and the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission.







Abstract
We show that chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circularly polarized luminescence with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08. This outstanding value is measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregates that form twisted bundles. Our measurements, obtained by a Mueller polarization analysis, are artifact&#8208;free and reveal a quasi&#8208;perfect correlation between the dissymmetry factors in absorption, gabs, and in emission glum. We interpret the bisignate dissymmetry factors as the signature of a strong coupling between chiral Frenkel excitons longitudinally excited along the bundles. We further resolve by polarimetry analysis the split in energy between the excited states with a Davydov splitting as small as 28&#8197;meV. We finally show the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission bands with opposite optical chirality. These mirror&#8208;imaged emissive chiroptical features emerge from the structural rigidity of the bundles that preserves the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>Controlled Construction of Heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)]4+ Cages: A Facile Approach for Site&#8208;Selective endo&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented heteroleptic [Pd2 (LA)2 (LB) (LC)] supramolecular cages were selectively constructed by taking advantage of a pair of orthogonal steric control elements encoded in distinct ligands. This strategy allows the site&#8208;selective introduction of distinct endo&#8208;functionalities into the cavity of the heteroleptic cage.







Abstract
Construction of supramolecular structures with internal functionalities is a promising approach to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities. The endo&#8208;functionalized [Pd12L24] and [Pd2L4] coordination cages represent the most successful systems in this regard. However, these systems mainly contain one type of endo&#8208;moiety. We herein provide a solution for the controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of [Pd2L4] cages. Site&#8208;selective introduction of the endo&#8208;functional group was achieved through the formation of heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)] cages. Using two orthogonal steric control elements is the key for the selective formation of the hetero&#8208;assemblies. We demonstrated the construction of two hetero&#8208;cages with a single internal functional group as well as a hetero&#8208;cage with two distinct endohedral functionalities. The endo&#8208;functionalized hetero&#8208;cages bound sulfonate guests with fast&#8208;exchange dynamics. This strategy provides a new solution for the controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of supramolecular cavities.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Dioxaphosphorane&#8208;Fused Diphosphacycles Exhibiting Unique Dynamic Fluorescence &#8220;On/Off&#8221; Properties</title>

Herein, we report a straightforward three&#8208;component synthesis of novel dioxaphosphorane&#8208;fused diphosphacycles with distinctive photophysical properties. Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing mechanism.







Abstract
Rigidly planar polycyclic phosphacycles featuring an internal dioxaphosphorane are promising photofunctional materials. However, the lack of efficient synthetic methods resulted in limited structural diversities which significantly hampered extensive study. Herein, we report a straightforward three&#8208;component synthesis of novel dioxaphosphorane&#8208;fused diphosphacycles with distinctive photophysical properties. Control experiments and theory calculations were performed to account for a plausible reaction mechanism. We also systematically investigated the structure&#8208;property relationships of these unprecedented platforms by combining experiments (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical computations. Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing process.

The insulin family proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre&#8208;made diaminodiacid bridge (DADA) at A&#8208;B chain terminal disulfide can be very easily and rapidly synthesized by a single&#8208;shot automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis. These new insulin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of insulin superfamily proteins (ISPs) has recently been widely studied to develop next&#8208;generation drugs. Separate synthesis of multiple peptide fragments and tedious chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain folding are usually encountered in these studies, limiting accessibility to ISP derivatives. Here we report the finding that insulin superfamily proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre&#8208;made diaminodiacid bridge at A&#8208;B chain terminal disulfide can be easily and rapidly synthesized by a single&#8208;shot automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis and expedient one&#8208;step folding. Our new H2 relaxin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts. This new synthetic strategy will expediate production of new ISP analogues for pharmaceutical studies.

         <title>Programmable 3D Hexagonal Geometry of DNA Tensegrity Triangles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In DNA nanotechnology, the programmability of non&#8208;canonical interactions is a key area of exploration. Here, we present three methods for programming a non&#8208;canonical hexagonal arrangement of normally rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles. We also determine cross&#8208;talking and reconfiguration between hexagonal and rhombohedral DNA crystals. These methods allow for additional versatility and programmability of non&#8208;canonical 3D DNA constructs.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical interactions in DNA remain under&#8208;explored in DNA nanotechnology. Recently, many structures with non&#8208;canonical motifs have been discovered, notably a hexagonal arrangement of typically rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles that forms through non&#8208;canonical sticky end interactions. Here, we find a series of mechanisms to program a hexagonal arrangement using: the sticky end sequence; triangle edge torsional stress; and crystallization condition.

     alt="Programmable 3D Hexagonal Geometry of DNA Tensegrity Triangles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DNA nanotechnology, the programmability of non-canonical interactions is a key area of exploration. Here, we present three methods for programming a non-canonical hexagonal arrangement of normally rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles. We also determine cross-talking and reconfiguration between hexagonal and rhombohedral DNA crystals. These methods allow for additional versatility and programmability of non-canonical 3D DNA constructs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-canonical interactions in DNA remain under-explored in DNA nanotechnology. Recently, many structures with non-canonical motifs have been discovered, notably a hexagonal arrangement of typically rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles that forms through non-canonical sticky end interactions. Here, we find a series of mechanisms to program a hexagonal arrangement using: the sticky end sequence; triangle edge torsional stress; and crystallization condition. We showcase cross-talking between Watson&#8211;Crick and non-canonical sticky ends in which the ratio between the two dictates segregation by crystal forms or combination into composite crystals. Finally, we develop a method for reconfiguring the long-range geometry of formed crystals from rhombohedral to hexagonal and vice versa. These data demonstrate fine control over non-canonical motifs and their topological self-assembly. This will vastly increase the programmability, functionality, and versatility of rationally designed DNA constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 Cathode Catalysts for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties have been synthesized, and the ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell not only presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 but also a long&#8208;term durability with more than 100&#8197;h operations in H2&#8208;O2 system. Density functional calculation further reveals that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst.







Abstract
To achieve practical application of fuel cell, it is vital to develop highly efficient and durable Pt&#8208;free catalysts. Herein, we prepare atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties and abundant mesoporous structure. The ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63 and 0.83&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free), and also exhibits long&#8208;term stability with more than 120 and 100&#8197;h for H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free) and H2&#8208;O2, respectively. Density functional calculations further unveil that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst, while the Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moiety is inactive for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which successfully explain the puzzle why most Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;organic framework &#8208;derived ZnNC catalysts in previous reports did not present good ORR activity because of their Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moieties. This work offers a new route for speeding up development of AEMFCs.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoximines via Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective C&#8722;H Borylation: A Remarkable Sidearm Effect of Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational&#8208;designed chiral bidentate boryl ligand (CBL) with a bulky side arm was effective in iridium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;and enantioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;silyl diaryl sulfoximines, affording a vast array of non&#8208;annulated chiral diaryl sulfoximines (39 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;%). DFT calculations revealed that the side arm was critical to confer high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity by virtue of the steric effect.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation of prochiral sulfoximines for non&#8208;annulated products remains a formidable challenge. We herein report iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;silyl diaryl sulfoximines using a well&#8208;designed chiral bidentate boryl ligand with a bulky side arm. This method is capable of accommodating a broad range of substrates under mild reaction conditions, affording a vast array of chiral sulfoximines with high enantioselectivities. We also demonstrated the synthetic utility on a preparative&#8208;scale C&#8722;H borylation for diverse downstream transformations, including the synthesis of chiral version of bioactive molecules. Computational studies showed that the bulky side arm of the ligand confers high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric effect.

         <title>Stable Operation of Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries in Air Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of aqueous organic redox flow batteries were operated in an insert atmosphere because the reduced organic molecules in anolyte were sensitive to oxygen. We propose a strategy for it by using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte to balance oxygen reduction reaction in anolyte. Just with a trace OER catalyst layer (Ni (OH)2) on the surface of current collector for catholyte, the flow cell shows excellent stability in air atmosphere.







Abstract
As a green route for large&#8208;scale energy storage, aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported AORFBs were operated in an inert atmosphere. Herein, we clarify this issue by using the reported AORFB (i.e., 3, 3&#8242;&#8208;(9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;methylbutanoicacid) (DPivOHAQ)||Ferrocyanide) as an example. We demonstrate that the dissolved O2 can oxidize the discharged DPivOHAQ in anolyte, leading to capacity&#8208;imbalance between anolyte and catholyte. Therefore, this cell shows continuous capacity fading when operated in an air atmosphere. We propose a simple strategy for this challenge, in which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte is employed to balance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anolyte. When using the Ni(OH)2&#8208;modifed carbon felt (CF) as a current collector for catholyte, this cell shows an excellent stability in air atmosphere because the Ni(OH)2&#8208;induced OER capacity in catholyte exactly balances the ORR capacity in anolyte. Such O2&#8208;balance strategy facilitates AORFBs&#8217; practical application.

         <title>Cadmium&#8208;Doped and Pincer Ligand&#8208;Modified Gold Nanocluster for Catalytic KA2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2 (PNP)2 (SR)12 with an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two PNP pincer ligands and two Au2Cd (SR)6 staple motifs has been developed as an efficient catalyst for the KA2 reaction. The cooperation between the three parts of the gold nanocluster has been verified as contributing to its high activity.







Abstract
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 (PNP=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyridine, SR=4&#8208;MeOPhS) consisting of an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two Au2CdS6 staple motifs, and two PNP pincer ligands has been designed, synthesized and well characterized. This cadmium and PNP pincer ligand co&#8208;modified gold nanocluster showed high catalytic efficiency in the KA2 reaction, featuring high TON, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as catalyst recyclability. Comparison of the catalytic performance between Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 and the structurally similar single cadmium (or PNP) modified gold nanoclusters demonstrates that the co&#8208;existence of the cadmium and PNP on the surface is crucial for the high catalytic activity of the gold nanocluster. This work would be enlightening for developing efficient catalysts for cascade reactions and discovering the catalytic potential of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations.

&lt;p&gt;A gold nanocluster Au&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PNP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (PNP=2,6-bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyridine, SR=4-MeOPhS) consisting of an icosahedral Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; kernel, two Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CdS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; staple motifs, and two PNP pincer ligands has been designed, synthesized and well characterized. This cadmium and PNP pincer ligand co-modified gold nanocluster showed high catalytic efficiency in the KA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reaction, featuring high TON, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as catalyst recyclability. Comparison of the catalytic performance between Au&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PNP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and the structurally similar single cadmium (or PNP) modified gold nanoclusters demonstrates that the co-existence of the cadmium and PNP on the surface is crucial for the high catalytic activity of the gold nanocluster. This work would be enlightening for developing efficient catalysts for cascade reactions and discovering the catalytic potential of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of the Active Sites on Metallic MoO2&#8722;x Nano&#8208;Sea&#8208;Urchin for Atmospheric CO2 Photoreduction Under UV, Visible, and Near&#8208;Infrared Light Illumination</title>

Metallic vacancy&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin shows excellent light absorption property covering from UV to NIR light and exhibits greatly enhanced selective photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction on a dual active site (Mo&#8722;Vo&#8722;Mo).







Abstract
We report an oxygen vacancy (Vo)&#8208;rich metallic MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin with partially occupied band, which exhibits super CO2 (even directly from the air) photoreduction performance under UV, visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light illumination. The Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin displays a CH4 evolution rate of 12.2 and 5.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under full spectrum and NIR light illumination in concentrated CO2, which is ca. 7&#8208; and 10&#8208;fold higher than the Vo&#8208;poor MoO2&#8722;x, respectively. More interestingly, the as&#8208;developed Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin can even reduce CO2 directly from the air with a CO evolution rate of 6.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under NIR light illumination. Experiments together with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy in MoO2&#8722;x can facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation to generate *COOH as well as the subsequent protonation of *CO towards the formation of CH4 because of the formation of a highly stable Mo&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo intermediate.

         <title>Design and Manipulation of a Minimalistic Hydrocarbon Nanocar on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design and construction of a minimalistic nanocar is described, featuring an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, controlled and fast manipulation of a nanocar is shown along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope.







Abstract
Nanocars are carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;molecules with a precise design that facilitates their atomic&#8208;scale control on a surface. The rational design of these molecules is important in atomic and molecular&#8208;scale manipulation to advance the development of molecular machines, as well as for a better understanding of self&#8208;assembly, diffusion and desorption processes. Here, we introduce the molecular design and construction of a collection of minimalistic nanocars. They feature an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, we show controlled and fast manipulation of the nanocars along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The mechanism behind the successful displacement is the induced dipole created over the nanocar by the STM tip. We utilized carbon monoxide functionalized tips both to avoid decomposition and accidentally picking the nanocars up during the manipulation. This strategy allowed thousands of maneuvers to successfully win the Nanocar Race II championship.

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with fast&#8208;charge capability and long lifespan could be applied in various sustainable energy storage systems, from personal devices to grid storage. Inspired by the disordered Rubik's cube, here, we report that the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept can lead to a very substantial improvement in the sodium storage properties of hexacyanoferrate (HCF). An example of HE&#8208;HCF has been synthesized as a proof of concept, which has achieved impressive cycling stability over 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and an outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability up to 75&#8197;C. Remarkable air stability and all&#8208;climate performance are observed. Its quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been measured and analyzed by multiple in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations. This strategy provides new insights into the development of advanced electrodes and provides the opportunity to tune electrochemical performance by tailoring the atomic composition.

         <title>Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalysis Manipulated Sulfur Speciation Pathway for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Na&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis facilitates successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas porous Fe2O3 core serves as the main reactor and accelerates long&#8208;chain Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe (CN)64&#8722;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell functions as physical barrier and catalyzes confined short&#8208;chain Na2S4 reduction to final Na2S inside the nanopores.







Abstract
The sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics and the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway, leading to serious shuttling effect and high activation barrier associated with sulfur cathode. We describe here the use of core&#8211;shell structured composite matrixes containing abundant catalytic sites for nearly fully reversible cycling of sulfur cathodes for Na&#8208;S batteries. The bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis provide successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas Fe2O3 accelerates Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe(CN)64&#8722;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell catalyzes Na2S4 reduction to Na2S. The electrochemically reactive Na2S can be readily charged back to sulfur with minimal overpotential. Simultaneously, stable cycling of Na&#8208;S pouch cell with a high reversible capacity of 696&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is also demonstrated. The bidirectional confined tandem catalysis renders the manipulation of sulfur redox electrochemistry for practical Na&#8208;S cells.

&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-doped polypyrrole shell catalyzes Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. The electrochemically reactive Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S can be readily charged back to sulfur with minimal overpotential. Simultaneously, stable cycling of Na-S pouch cell with a high reversible capacity of 696&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is also demonstrated. The bidirectional confined tandem catalysis renders the manipulation of sulfur redox electrochemistry for practical Na-S cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Telomerase&#8208;Assisted Strategy for Regeneration of DNA Nanomachines in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a smart DNA nanomachine that can perform regeneration operations via telomerase (TE)&#8208;aided track extension in living cells. By customizing apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) as the responsive module of the nanomachine, multiply augmented imaging of APE1 at the single&#8208;cell level could be implemented. By arranging the regenerative module, the nanomachine could provide the expression diversity of TE in different cell lines.







Abstract
DNA nanomachines have been engineered into diverse personalized devices for diagnostic imaging of biomarkers; however, the regeneration of DNA nanomachines in living cells remains challenging. Here, we report an ingenious DNA nanomachine that can implement telomerase (TE)&#8208;activated regeneration in living cells. Upon apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;responsive initiation of the nanomachine, the walker of the nanomachine moves along tracks regenerated by TE, generating multiply amplified signals through which APE1 can be imaged in situ. Additionally, augmentation of the signal due to the regeneration of the nanomachines could reveal differential expression of TE in different cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the use of biomarkers to assist in the regeneration of nanomachines in living cells. This study offers a new paradigm for the development of more applicable and efficient DNA nanomachines.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing Passivation Layer via Surface Chelation for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface treatment of inorganic perovskite film by trifluoroacetamidine featuring chelation configuration and multiple fluorine atoms allows record power conversion efficiency of inorganic perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Minimizing surface defect is vital to further improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed a passivator trifluoroacetamidine (TFA) to suppress CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx film defects. The amidine group of TFA can strongly chelate onto the perovskite surface to suppress the iodide vacancy, strengthened by additional hydrogen bonds. Moreover, three fluorine atoms allow strong intermolecular connection via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus constructing a robust shield against moisture. The TFA&#8208;treated PSCs exhibit remarkably suppressed recombination, yielding the record PCEs of 21.35&#8201;% and 17.21&#8201;% for 0.09&#8197;cm2 and 1.0&#8197;cm2 device areas, both of which are the highest for all&#8208;inorganic PSCs so far. The device also achieves a PCE of 39.78&#8201;% under indoor illumination, the highest for all&#8208;inorganic indoor photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, TFA greatly improves device ambient stability by preserving 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 960&#8197;h.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Inspired Polymers with Metal&#8208;Site&#8208;Regulated Ordered Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in poly(amino acid)s mediated by an exogenous ligand and metal ions. The polypeptides show controllable transitions between &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix conformations as well as a conformation&#8208;driven vesicular expanding and shrinking phenomenon. Moreover, the metallopolymers self&#8208;assemble into ferritin&#8208;inspired nanovehicles for efficient brain delivery and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging in vivo.







Abstract
Metal ions play critical roles in facilitating peptide folding and inducing conformational transitions, thereby impacting on the biological activity of many proteins. However, the effect of metal sites on the hierarchical structures of biopolymers is still poorly understood. Herein, inspired by metalloproteins, we report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in synthetic polymers mediated by a variety of metal ions. The copolymers are decorated with clinically available desferrioxamine (DFO) as an exogenous ligand template, which presents a geometric constraint toward peptide backbone via short&#8208;range hydrogen bonding interactions, thus dramatically altering the secondary conformations and self&#8208;assembly behaviors of polypeptides and allowing for a controllable &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition modulated by metal&#8211;ligand interactions. These metallopolymers could form ferritin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structures with high stability and membrane activity for efficient brain delivery across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo.

         <title>MOFs with Open Metal(III) Sites for the Environmental Capture of Polar Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimeric metaIII) carboxylate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) exhibit a preferential adsorption of polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over water through a direct binding of the VOC vapor on the open metal sites, paving the way for their utilization in indoor air quality control.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMS) interact strongly with a range of polar gases/vapors. However, under ambient conditions, their selective adsorption is generally impaired due to a high OMS affinity to water. This led previously to the privilege selection of hydrophobic MOFs for the selective capture/detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we show that this paradigm is challenged by metal(III) polycarboxylates MOFs, bearing a high concentration of OMS, as MIL&#8208;100(Fe), enabling the selective capture of polar VOCs even in the presence of water. With experimental and computational tools, including single&#8208;component gravimetric and dynamic mixture adsorption measurements, in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory calculations we reveal that this adsorption mechanism involves a direct coordination of the VOC on the OMS, associated with an interaction energy that exceeds that of water. Hence, MOFs with OMS are demonstrated to be of interest for air purification purposes.

         <title>Co&#8208;Dissolved Isostructural Polyoxovanadates to Construct Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>

Dispersing nanosized [PtV9O28]7&#8722; clusters into a [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution, the so&#8208;called co&#8208;dissolved strategy, ensures double separations resulting in the construction of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The SAC with Pt/O synergism can efficiently boost CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
We explored a co&#8208;dissolved strategy to embed mono&#8208;dispersed Pt center into V2O5 support via dissolving [PtV9O28]7&#8722; into [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution. The uniform dispersion of [PtV9O28]7&#8722; in [V10O28]6&#8722; solution allows [PtV9O28]7&#8722; to be surrounded by [V10O28]6&#8722; clusters via a freeze&#8208;drying process. The V centers in both [PtV9O28]7&#8722; and [V10O28]6&#8722; were converted into V2O5 via a calcination process to stabilize Pt center. These double separations can effectively prevent the Pt center agglomeration during the high&#8208;temperature conversion process, and achieve 100&#8201;% utilization of Pt in [PtV9O28]7&#8722;. The resulting Pt&#8208;V2O5 single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a CH4 yield of 247.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 25&#8197;times higher than that of Pt nanoparticle on the V2O5 support, which was accompanied by the lactic acid photooxidation to form pyruvic acid. Systematical investigations on this unambiguous structure demonstrate an important role of Pt&#8722;O atomic pair synergy for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Pore Geometry and Surface Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Anhydrous Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three robust and porous covalent organic frameworks with rare concave dodecagonal nanopores were designed and synthesized via a pore engineering approach. The fine&#8208;tailored and functionalized pored can anchor H3PO4 molecules to form abundant proton hopping sites, thus affording high proton conductivity at anhydrous conditions.







Abstract
Developing new materials for anhydrous proton conduction under high&#8208;temperature conditions is significant and challenging. Herein, we create a series of highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a pore engineering approach. We simultaneously engineer the pore geometry (generating concave dodecagonal nanopores) and pore surface (installing multiple functional groups such as &#8722;C=N&#8722;, &#8722;OH, &#8722;N=N&#8722; and &#8722;CF3) to improve the utilization efficiency and host&#8211;guest interaction of proton carriers, hence benefiting the enhancement of anhydrous proton conduction. Upon loading with H3PO4, COFs can realize a proton conductivity of 2.33&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under anhydrous conditions, among the highest values of all COF materials. These materials demonstrate good stability and maintain high proton conductivity over a wide temperature range (80&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This work paves a new way for designing COFs for anhydrous proton conduction applications, which shows great potential as high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membranes.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Near&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence from Functionalized Lead&#8208;Free Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient thermally&#8208;activated delayed near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence has been achieved in lead&#8208;free CuInSe2&#8208;based nanocrystals surface&#8208;functionalized with tetracene ligands, prolonging the exciton lifetime to 60&#8197;&#956;s at room temperature. Such long&#8208;lived near&#8208;infrared emission may find an array of applications.







Abstract
As an analogue to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of organic molecules, thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) observed in molecule&#8208;functionalized semiconductor nanocrystals represents an exotic mechanism to harvest energy from dark molecular triplets and to obtain controllable, long&#8208;lived PL from nanocrystals. The reported TADPL systems have successfully covered the visible spectrum. However, TADF molecules already emit very efficiently in the visible, diminishing the technological impact of the less&#8208;efficient nanocrystal&#8208;molecule TADPL. Here we report bright, near&#8208;infrared TADPL in lead&#8208;free CuInSe2 nanocrystals functionalized with carboxylated tetracene ligands, which results from efficient triplet energy transfer from photoexcited nanocrystals to ligands, followed with thermally activated reverse energy transfer from ligand triplets back to nanocrystals. This strategy prolonged the nanocrystal exciton lifetime from 100&#8197;ns to 60&#8197;&#956;s at room temperature.

         <title>Designing Solid Electrolyte Interfaces towards Homogeneous Na Deposition: Theoretical Guidelines for Electrolyte Additives and Superior High&#8208;Rate Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) electrolyte additive is developed to accelerate Na ion diffusion through the solid electrolyte interphase layer and induce spherical Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode due to the derived NaBr with high ionic conductivity. As enabled by the 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, the Na||Na3V2 (PO4)3 full cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising metal anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Nevertheless, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and uncontrollable Na dendrite growth lead to disastrous short circuit and poor cycle life. Through phase field and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, we first predict that the sodium bromide (NaBr) with the lowest Na ion diffusion energy barrier among sodium halogen compounds (NaX, X=F, Cl, Br, I) is the ideal SEI composition to induce the spherical Na deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Then, 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) additive is introduced into the common fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte (the corresponding SEI has high mechanical stability) to construct a desirable NaBr&#8208;rich stable SEI layer. When the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell utilizes the electrolyte with 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, an extraordinary capacity retention of 94&#8201;% is achieved after 2000&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 10&#8197;C. This study provides a design philosophy for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode and can be expanded to other metal anodes.

         <title>Rational Positioning of Metal Ions to Stabilize Open Tin Sites in Beta Zeolite for Catalytic Conversion of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal ions such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ were positioned within Sn&#8208;Beta zeolite to form adjacent bimetallic catalytically active sites with stable open Sn sites. The Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst selectively converts glucose to methyl lactate and methyl vinyl glycolate in methanol in high yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively.

Via hydrothermal synthesis of Sn&#8208;Al gels, mild dealumination and ion exchange, a bimetallic Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst was prepared which can convert glucose to methyl lactate (MLA) and methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) in methanol at yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively. Results from solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, spectroscopic analysis, probe&#8208;temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, and density functional theory calculations conclusively reveal that the openness of the Sn sites, such as by the formation of [(SiO)3&#8722;Sn&#8722;OH] entities, is governed by an adjacent metal cation such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. This relies on the low structure&#8208;defective pore channel, provided by the current synthesis scheme, and the specific silica hydroxyl anchor point is associated with the incorporation of Sn for additional and precise metal ion localization. The presence of metal cations significantly improved the catalytic performance of Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta for glucose isomerization and conversion to MLA of sugar compared with Sn&#8208;Beta.

         <title>Increased Surface Density of States at the Fermi Level for Electron Transport Across Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductance of molecular junctions bridged in Pt&#8208; or Pd&#8208;adlayer modified Au electrodes was investigated. The conductance on bimetallic electrodes was found 2&#8211;30 fold higher than that on Au electrodes. This was attributed to the increase in the local density of states by partially&#8208;filled d shells of the adlayer.







Abstract
Fermi's golden rule, a remarkable concept for the transition probability involving continuous states, is applicable to the interfacial electron&#8208;transporting efficiency via correlation with the surface density of states (SDOS). Yet, this concept has not been reported to tailor single&#8208;molecule junctions where gold is an overwhelmingly popular electrode material due to its superior amenability in regenerating molecular junctions. At the Fermi level, however, the SDOS of gold is small due to its fully filled d&#8208;shell. To increase the electron&#8208;transport efficiency, herein, gold electrodes are modified by a monolayer of platinum or palladium that bears partially filled d&#8208;shells and exhibits significant SDOS at the Fermi energy. An increase by 2&#8211;30 fold is found for single&#8208;molecule conductance of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hexanes bridged via common headgroups. The improved junction conductance is attributed to the electrode self&#8208;energy which involves a stronger coupling with the molecule and a larger SDOS participated by d&#8208;electrons at the electrode&#8208;molecule interfaces.

         <title>Multilayered Ceramic Membrane with Ion Conducting Thin Layer Induced by Interface Reaction for Stable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting thin layers rooted in multilayered ceramic membranes has been developed. This novel technique paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance multilayered ceramics with functional layers for various applications, from ceramic fuel cells and membrane reactors to gas sensors.







Abstract
Conventional methods for fabricating multilayered ceramic membranes with ion conducting dense thin layers are often cumbersome, costly, and limited by poor adhesion between layers. Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, here, we report an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2&#8722;&#948; (CGO) thin layers rooted in the parent multilayered ceramic membranes by only one firing step. The CGO dense layers are very thin, and adhered strongly to the parent support layer, ensuring low ionic transport resistance and structural integrity of the multilayered membranes. When using as an oxygen permeable membrane for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen, it shows very long durability in harsh conditions containing H2O, CH4, H2, CO2 and H2S. Furthermore, our approach is highly scalable and applicable to a wide variety of ion conducting thin layers, including Y0.08Zr0.92O2&#8722;&#948;, Ce0.9Sm0.1O2&#8722;&#948; and Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;.

         <title>Correlating Oxidation State and Surface Ligand Motifs with the Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface oxidation state of titanium oxynitride photocatalysts influences C2 product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction. The surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state can be regulated and controlled through the concentration of nitrogen dopant and oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The design for non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based catalysts with the function of producing C2+ products requires systematic knowledge of the intrinsic connection between the surface state as well as the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this work, photochemical in situ spectral surface characterization techniques combined with the first principle calculations (DFT) were applied to investigate the relationships between the composition of surface states, coordinated motifs, and catalytic selectivity of a titanium oxynitride catalyst. When the catalyst mediates CO2 photoreduction, C2 product selectivity is positively correlated with the surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state is regulated and controlled by coordinated motifs of N&#8722;Ti&#8208;O/V[O], which can reduce the potential dimerization energy barriers of *CO&#8722;CO* and promote spontaneous formation of the subsequent *CO&#8722;CH2* intermediate. This phenomenon provides a new perspective for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for photoreduction of CO2 into useful products.

         <title>An All&#8208;Natural Wood&#8208;Inspired Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting surface nanocrystallization method was developed to make the surface&#8208;inert and weakly interacting wood particles better assemble to construct the aerogel. This bottom&#8208;up method allows the preparation of large&#8208;size composite aerogels. The wood&#8208;inspired oriented channel structure endows the obtained aerogel with superior thermal insulation properties to natural wood and most existing commercial sponges.







Abstract
The oriented pore structure of wood endows it with a variety of outstanding properties, among which the low thermal conductivity has attracted researchers to develop wood&#8208;like aerogels as excellent thermal insulation materials. However, the increasing demands of environmental protection have put forward new and strict requirements for the sustainability of aerogels. Here, we report an all&#8208;natural wood&#8208;inspired aerogel consisting of all&#8208;natural ingredients and develop a method to activate the surface&#8208;inert wood particles to construct the aerogel. The obtained wood&#8208;inspired aerogel has channel structure similar to that of natural wood, endowing it with superior thermal insulation properties to most existing commercial sponges. In addition, remarkable fire retardancy and complete biodegradability are integrated. With the above outstanding performances, this sustainable wood&#8208;inspired aerogel will be an ideal substitute for the existing commercial thermal insulation materials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;controllable Luminescence from Radicals Leading to Ratiometric Emission Switching via Dynamic Intermolecular Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;controllable luminescence from a new molecular radical system featuring photoinduced structural change and dynamic intermolecular coupling was achieved. Unprecedented ratiometric emission with a wide range of color changes was demonstrated. Luminescence&#8208;encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns with a &#8220;burn after reading&#8221; mode are demonstrated by employing the dynamic luminescent radical material.







Abstract
The development of photoinduced luminescent radicals with dynamic emission color is still challenging. Herein we report a novel molecular radical system (TBIQ) that shows photo&#8208;controllable luminescence, leading to a wide range of ratiometric color changes via light excitation. The conjugated skeleton of TBIQ is decorated with steric&#8208;demanding tertiary butyl groups that enable appropriate intermolecular interaction to make dynamic intermolecular coupling possible for controllable behaviors. We reveal that the helicenic pseudo&#8208;planar conformation of TBIQ experiences a planarization process after light excitation, leading to more compactly stacked supermolecules and thus generating radicals via intermolecular charge transfer. The photo&#8208;controllable luminescent radical system is employed for a high&#8208;level information encryption application. This study may offer unique insight into molecular dynamic motion for optical manufacturing and broaden the scope of smart&#8208;responsive materials for advanced applications.

         <title>Increasing Molecular Planarity through Donor/Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Improved NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy under 1064&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a simple strategy based on molecular planarity to design a high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type conjugated small molecule with both intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and robust energy output. The resulting probe was used for 1064&#8197;nm laser&#8208;triggered NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and dual&#8208;mode imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy in vivo.







Abstract
Developing conjugated small molecules (CSM) with intense NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) absorption for phototheranostic is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to a lack of reliable design guidelines. This study reports a high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CSM for phototheranostic by tailoring molecular planarity. A series of CSM show bathochromic absorption extended to the NIR&#8208;II region upon the increasing thiophene number, but an excessive number of thiophene results in decreased NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1400&#8197;nm) brightness and photothermal effects. Further introduction of terminal nonconjugated alkyl chain can enhance NIR&#8208;II absorption coefficient, NIR&#8208;IIa brightness, and photothermal effects. Mechanism studies ascribe this overall enhancement to molecular planarity stemming from the collective contribution of donor/side&#8208;chain engineering. This finding directs the design of NIR&#8208;II CSM by rational manipulating molecular planarity to perform 1064&#8197;nm mediated phototheranostic at high efficiency.

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis of Urea with Nitrate and Carbon Dioxide over Iron&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based electrocatalyst was fabricated by a facile liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation technique, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis with CO2 and NO3&#8722;. The superior performance is ascribed to the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe3O4 on CNTs as the dual active sites for facilitating the generation of *NH2 and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts to generate key *NH2 and *CO intermediates is crucial for ambient urea electrosynthesis with nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Here we report a liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation method to fabricate symbiotic graphitic carbon encapsulated amorphous iron and iron oxide nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe3O4/CNTs). Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe3O4/CNTs exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis using NO3&#8722; and CO2, affording a urea yield of 1341.3&#177;112.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a faradic efficiency of 16.5&#177;6.1&#8201;% at ambient conditions. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe3O4 on CNTs provide dual active sites for the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722; and CO2, thus generating key *NH2 and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation. This work would be helpful for design and development of high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts for ambient urea synthesis.

An unprecedented Smiles&#8208;like rearrangement of diphenyl&#8208;(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane gives access to a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane that forms stable heteroleptic [Cu (NN) (PP)]+ complexes. Unfavorable flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state as a result of diimine encapsulation (bpy, phen, or mmp) is responsible for the enhanced luminescent properties.







Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane with metal&#8208;confining properties was efficiently synthesized thanks to an unprecedented Smiles&#8208;like rearrangement of diphenyl&#8208;(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane in the presence of excess n&#8208;BuLi. The cis&#8208;chelating bidentate ligand is capable of forming very stable heteroleptic [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ complexes in which a metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand (bpy, phen, or mmp) is located within the cyclodextrin cavity. As a result of ligand encapsulation, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is disfavored, thereby resulting in enhanced luminescent properties.

A molecular design principle of the third component is established to tackle the issue of excessive self&#8208;aggregation of Y6&#8208;derivatives during the film formation through crystallinity and miscibility regulation. With the addition of BTP&#8208;Th, the ternary device yielded a remarkable efficiency of 18.53&#8201;%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control reference binary device.







Abstract
On the premise of strongly crystalline materials involved, it is a challenge to control the phase separation of bulk&#8208;heterojunction donor/acceptor active layer to fabricate high&#8208;performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we develop a molecular design strategy of the third component to synthesize three guest materials (namely BTPT, BTP&#8208;Th, and BTP&#8208;2Th) to address this issue. We investigate and reveal the effect of crystallinity and miscibility of the third component in controlling the phase separation of Y6&#8208;derivatives&#8208;based blend film. As a result, a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% is obtained in the ternary PSC based on PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6 with BTP&#8208;Th as the third component, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control binary device. Our study offers a molecular design strategy to develop a third component for building ternary PSCs in terms of crystallinity and miscibility regulation.

         <title>Water&#8208;Harvesting Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Gigantic Al24 Units and their Deconstruction into Molecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;linkage strategy to make single crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) gives porous solids with gigantic Al24 units. Selective linkage replacement rigidifies the MOFs resulting in outstanding water&#8208;harvesting behaviour. The selective linkage dissociation of the MOF provides a new route to prepare highly symmetrical clusters.







Abstract
In contrast to the vast Al&#8208;oxo molecular cluster chemistry, Al&#8208;based building units for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) construction are limited in structural diversity and complexity. Synthesis of single crystalline MOFs based on this &#8220;hard&#8221; metal is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the Al&#8208;organic coordination linkages. Here, a strategy to employ two kinds of linkages with distinct strength&#8212;strong Al&#8208;carboxylate linkage and weak Cu&#8208;pyrazol N linkage&#8212;gives FDM&#8208;91 (FDM=Fudan Materials) with gigantic Al24&#8208;based units. After replacing the weak moieties with organic linkers post&#8208;synthetically, two new stable MOFs with exceptional water harvesting capacity (up to 0.53&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycling performance are developed. Linkage&#8208;selective dissociation of FDM&#8208;91 further leads to the isolation of the Al24 molecular clusters. The versatile chemistry performed here to reinforce or deconstruct MOFs provides a new way to make important extended and discrete structures.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Vinylphosphonates and Diarylvinylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first efficient Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using H2 was developed, affording chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee and 1000&#8197;S/C (substrate/catalyst). The calculation and experimental mechanism study indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the product originate from H2 and the reaction proceeds through a NiII rather than Ni0 cyclic process.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted ethylphosphonate and ethylphosphine oxide compounds are widely used in drugs, pesticides, and ligands. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis is still rare. Of the only asymmetric hydrogenation methods available at present, all cases use rare metal catalysts. Herein, we report an efficient earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal nickel catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation affording the corresponding chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99&#8201;% ee, after recrystallization) and 1000&#8197;S/C (substrate/catalyst); this is also the first study on the asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using a nickel catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere. The catalytic mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and calculations which indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the products come from hydrogen gas. Additionally, it is believed that the reaction involves a NiII rather than Ni0 cyclic process based on the weak attractive interactions between the Ni catalyst and terminal olefin substrate.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Fluorofluorophores for Multicolor In Vivo Imaging
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorofluorophores (fluoro refers to fluorine and fluorescence) are chemical tools to study perfluorocarbons. To understand the biodistribution of perfluorocarbons in animals, fluorofluorophores that emit past 1000&#8197;nm are necessary. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, and application of shortwave infrared (SWIR)&#8208;emissive fluorofluorophores towards understanding how to control the pharmacokinetics of perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions in mammals.







Abstract
Developing chemical tools to detect and influence biological processes is a cornerstone of chemical biology. Here we combine two tools which rely on orthogonality&#8211; perfluorocarbons and multiplexed shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence imaging&#8211; to visualize nanoemulsions in real time in living mice. Drawing inspiration from fluorous and SWIR fluorophore development, we prepared two SWIR&#8208;emissive, fluorous&#8208;soluble chromenylium polymethine dyes. These are the most red&#8208;shifted fluorous fluorophores&#8211; &#8220;fluorofluorophores&#8221;&#8212;to date. After characterizing the dyes, their utility was demonstrated by tracking perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion biodistribution in vivo. Using an excitation&#8208;multiplexed approach to image two variables simultaneously, we gained insight into the importance of size and surfactant identity on biodistribution.

         <title>C3&#8208;Cyanation of Pyridines: Constraints on Electrophiles and Determinants of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;selective cyanation of pyridines was accomplished by a tandem process of borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration, substitution of the resulting dihydropyridine with a cyano electrophile, and finally oxidative aromatization. This method was suitable for use in late&#8208;stage cyanation of pyridine drugs.







Abstract
Methods for C&#8722;H cyanation of pyridines are rare. Here, we report a method for C3&#8208;selective cyanation of pyridines by a tandem process with the reaction of an in situ generated dihydropyridine with a cyano electrophile as the key step. The method is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine drugs. The low reduction potential of the electrophile and effective transfer of the nitrile group were found to be essential for the success of this method. We studied the reaction mechanism in detail by means of control experiments and theoretical calculations and found that a combination of electronic and steric factors determined the regioselectivity of reactions involving C2&#8208;substituted pyridines.

         <title>Evidence of Sulfur Non&#8208;Innocence in [CoII(dithiacyclam)]2+&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison of the abilities of two CoII complexes bearing N4 and S2N2 ligations to mediate 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the reactive intermediates point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
In many metalloenzymes, sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8208;ligation in cobalt mediated oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (1; cyclam=1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) and the S&#8208;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (2; S2N2&#8208;cyclam=1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the CoII centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.

         <title>Electronic Perturbation of Copper Single&#8208;Atom CO2 Reduction Catalysts in a Molecular Way</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atoms is achieved on graphdiyne derivates with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H, &#8722;OMe), rendering distinctive Cu&#948;+ valance and electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity. In situ spectroscopical and theoretical studies reveal that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the &#8722;F group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward a high CH4 production.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) plays a crucial role in harnessing their catalytic activities, yet challenges remain at a molecular scale in a controlled fashion. By tailoring the structure of graphdiyne (GDY) with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups, we show herein the electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atom CO2 reduction catalysts in a molecular way. The elaborately introduced functional groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H and &#8722;OMe) can regulate the valance state of Cu&#948;+, which is found to be directly scaled with the selectivity of the electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. An optimum CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 72.3&#8201;% was achieved over the Cu SAC on the F&#8208;substituted GDY. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the electron&#8208;withdrawing group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward the CH4 production. Our strategy paves the way for precise electronic perturbation of SACs toward efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheets@Crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorods for High Current&#8208;density Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step strategy. The catalysts display efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER, as well as for water splitting in neutral solution. The amorphous structure abundant unsaturated sites altered the local electronic structure of metallic sites and optimized the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (O* to OOH*).







Abstract
It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheets@crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorods (Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5) was synthesized using a facil one&#8208;step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514&#8197;mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 delivers excellent stability for at least 300&#8197;h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect&#8208;rich amorphous structure of Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H2O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.

         <title>Persicamidines&#8212;Unprecedented Sesquarterpenoids with Potent Antiviral Bioactivity against Coronaviruses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of highly unusual terpenoids (persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E) was isolated. Extensive NMR analysis unraveled a hexacyclic terpenoid with a modified sugar and a highly unusual isourea moiety. Persicamidines showed potent antiviral activity. Each displayed single&#8208;digit nanomolar activity against hCoV&#8208;229E, comparable to that of remdesivir. Particularly Persicamidine&#8197;C was a very potent inhibitor of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, with an IC50 value of 74&#8197;nM.







Abstract
A new family of highly unusual sesquarterpenoids (persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E) exhibiting significant antiviral activity was isolated from a newly discovered actinobacterial strain, Kibdelosporangium persicum sp. nov., collected from a hot desert in Iran. Extensive NMR analysis unraveled a hexacyclic terpenoid molecule with a modified sugar moiety on one side and a highly unusual isourea moiety fused to the terpenoid structure. The structures of the five analogues differed only in the aminoalkyl side chain attached to the isourea moiety. Persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E showed potent activity against hCoV&#8208;229E and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses in the nanomolar range together with very good selectivity indices, making persicamidines promising as starting points for drug development.

Encapsulation makes the difference!. A&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane ligand with metal&#8208;confining properties is key in the stabilization of heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes. In their Research Article (e202214638), Nicola Armaroli, B&#233;atrice Delavaux&#8208;Nicot, Jean&#8208;Fran&#231;ois Nierengarten, Dominique Armspach et&#8197;al. show how encapsulation of the metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand moiety in the cyclodextrin cavity influences their electronic properties. In particular, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is largely prevented, which results in enhanced luminescent properties.

Multilayered ceramic membranes with ion&#8208;conducting dense thin layers are essential platforms for solid&#8208;state electrochemical devices, gas separation membranes, and sensors. In their Research Article (e202210485), Heqing Jiang et&#8197;al. develop a new interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of zirconia&#8208; or ceria&#8208;based dense thin layers rooted in multilayered ceramic membranes that show robust and practical performance for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen.

         <title>Biological Effects of Black Phosphorus Nanomaterials on Mammalian Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of black phosphorus nanomaterials (BPNMs) on biological systems and human health is of significant concern as a result of their increased usage. The mechanisms and regulation factors of BPNMs&#8217; endogenous toxicity to mammalian systems are reviewed at the levels of body, tissues, cells, organelles, and molecules. A rule&#8208;based machine learning model reveals that experimental methods, lateral size, and incubation time are determinants for their cell viability.







Abstract
The remarkable progress of applied black phosphorus nanomaterials (BPNMs) is attributed to BP's outstanding properties. Due to its potential for applications, environmental release and subsequent human exposure are virtually inevitable. Therefore, how BPNMs impact biological systems and human health needs to be considered. In this comprehensive Minireview, the most recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms and regulation factors of BPNMs&#8217; endogenous toxicity to mammalian systems are presented. These achievements lay the groundwork for an understanding of its biological effects, aimed towards establishing regulatory principles to minimize the adverse health impacts.

         <title>Exploring Helical Peptides and Foldamers for the Design of Metal Helix Frameworks: Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress of metal peptide frameworks (MPFs) comprised of helical peptides and foldamers for future energy storage, chiral recognition, and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Flexible and biocompatible metal peptide frameworks (MPFs) derived from short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been explored for the storage of greenhouse gases, molecular recognition, and chiral transformations. In addition to short flexible peptides, peptides with specifically folded conformations have recently been utilized to fabricate a variety of metal helix frameworks (MHFs). The secondary structures of the peptides govern the structure&#8208;assembly relationship and thereby control the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#8208;MHFs. Particularly, the hierarchical structural organization of peptide&#8208;based MHFs has not yet been discussed in detail. Here, we describe the recent progress of metal&#8208;driven folded peptide assembly to construct 3D porous structures for use in future energy storage, chiral recognition, and biomedical applications, which could be envisioned as an alternative to the conventional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Multicolour Luminescence of Organic Materials: Internal Mechanism and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to Kasha's rule for luminescent materials, the emitting electronic level of a given multiplicity is the lowest excited level of that multiplicity. A characteristic exception, excitation&#8208;dependent multicolour emission, is presented systemically, with the aim of enriching fundamental photophysics and potential applications. This Minireview will serve as a timely summary of the scattered reports of multicolour phenomena and their underlying mechanisms.







Abstract
Excitation&#8208;dependent emission (Ex&#8208;de) materials have been of considerable academic interest and have potential applications in real life. Such multicolour luminescence is a characteristic exception to the ubiquitously accepted Kasha's rule. This phenomenon has been increasingly presented in some studies on different luminescence systems; however, a systematic overview of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is currently absent. Herein, we resolve this issue by classifying multicolour luminescence from single chromophores and dual/ternary chromophores, as well as multiple emitting species. The underlying processes are described based on electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which the phenomenon occurs. Before we present it in categories, related photophysical and photochemical foundations are introduced. This systematic overview will provide a clear approach to designing multicolour luminescence materials for special applications.

         <title>The Covalent Functionalization of Surface&#8208;Supported Graphene: An Update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent modification of graphene supported on a surface makes it possible to control the graphene reactivity, tailor its electronic properties, and immobilize active molecules. Based on a critical comparison of the different chemical routes, this Review provides up&#8208;to&#8208;date guidelines for working with chemically modified 2D materials on a surface.







Abstract
In the last decade, the use of graphene supported on solid surfaces has broadened its scope and applications, and graphene has acquire a promising role as a major component of high&#8208;performance electronic devices. In this context, the chemical modification of graphene has become essential. In particular, covalent modification offers key benefits, including controllability, stability, and the facility to be integrated into manufacturing operations. In this Review, we critically comment on the latest advances in the covalent modification of supported graphene on substrates. We analyze the different chemical modifications with special attention to radical reactions. In this context, we review the latest achievements in reactivity control, tailoring electronic properties, and introducing active functionalities. Finally, we extended our analysis to other emerging 2D materials supported on surfaces, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, and elemental analogs of graphene.

         <title>sn&#8208;1 Specificity of Lysophosphatidylcholine Acyltransferase&#8208;1 Revealed by a Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isomer&#8208;resolving mass spectrometry assay reveals that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) has an sn&#8208;1 specificity when catalyzing the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The specific link between PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 and the activity of LPCAT1 enables visualization of the boundaries between cancerous and normal regions in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue via desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).







Abstract
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) plays a critical role in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in cellular lipidome. However, evidence is scarce regarding its sn&#8208;selectivity, viz. the preference of assembling acyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;A (CoA) at the C1 or C2&#8208;hydroxyl on a glycerol backbone because of difficulty to quantify the thus&#8208;formed PC sn&#8208;isomers. We have established a multiplexed assay to measure both sn&#8208; and acyl&#8208;chain selectivity of LPCAT1 toward a mixture of acyl&#8208;CoAs by integrating isomer&#8208;resolving tandem mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal that LPCAT1 shows exclusive sn&#8208;1 specificity regardless of the identity of acyl&#8208;CoAs. We further confirm that elevated PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 relative to its sn&#8208;isomer results from an increased expression of LPCAT1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue as compared to normal liver tissue. MS imaging via desorption electrospray ionization of PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 thus enables visualization of HCC margins in human liver tissue at a molecular level.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Nanoconfinement Effect on Nanoreactor via Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence microscopy based on Ru@MSN realizes direct observation of nanoconfinement during electrochemical process which can bridges mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications. Long time decay and recover ability caused by nanoarchitecture are resolved. The nanoconfinement effects are stable even in complex biological conditions, offering excellent route for single biomolecule imaging.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement in mesoporous nanoarchitectures could dramatically change molecular transport and reaction kinetics during electrochemical process. A molecular&#8208;level understanding of nanoconfinement and mass transport is critical for the applications, but a proper route to study it is lacking. Herein, we develop a single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence (SNECL) microscopy based on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle to directly visualize in situ nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced electrochemical reactions at the single molecule level. Meanwhile, mass transport capability of single nanoreactor, reflected as long decay time and recovery ability, is monitored and simulated with a high spatial resolution. The nanoconfinement effects in our system also enable imaging single proteins on cellular membrane. Our SNECL approach may pave the way to decipher the nanoconfinement effects during electrochemical process, and build bridges between mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications.

         <title>A Type 1 Aldolase, NahE, Catalyzes a Stereoselective Nitro&#8208;Michael Reaction: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective Michael addition of pyruvate to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes catalyzed by NahE, a type 1 aldolase, is reported. &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids can be isolated after oxidative decarboxylation in high yields on a preparative scale, providing access to precursors of &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogues of demonstrated pharmacological activity.







Abstract
Michael addition reactions are highly useful in organic synthesis and are commonly accomplished using organocatalysts. However, the corresponding biocatalytic Michael additions are rare, typically lack synthetically useful substrate scope, and suffer from low stereoselectivity. Herein we report a biocatalytic nitro&#8208;Michael addition, catalyzed by NahE, that proceeds with low catalyst loading at room temperature in moderate to excellent enantioselectivity and high yields. A series of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes reacted with pyruvate in the presence of NahE to give, after oxidative decarboxylation, &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids in up to 99&#8201;% yield without need for chromatography, providing a simple preparative&#8208;scale route to chiral GABA analogues. This reaction represents the first example of an aldolase displaying promiscuous Michaelase activity and opens the use of nitroalkenes in place of aldehydes as substrates for aldolases.

         <title>Dearomatization of Biaryls through Polarity Mismatched Radical Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral dearomatization transforms biaryls into complex spirocycles commonly found in bioactive natural products. This polarity mismatched radical spirocyclization tolerates diverse functional groups and is applied in the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones. The first synthesis of denobilone A, a cytotoxic plant metabolite, showcases its utility to access underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions involving radical cyclizations can facilitate the synthesis of complex polycyclic systems that find applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. Here we employ redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis to affect a radical spirocyclization that transforms biaryls into spirocyclic cyclohexadienones under mild reaction conditions. In a departure from previously reported methods, our work demonstrates the polarity mismatched addition of a nucleophilic radical to an electron rich arene, and allows the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones with broad functional group tolerance. By transforming biaryls into spirocycles, our methodology accesses underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space, and provides an efficient means of creating quaternary spirocenters that we apply to the first synthesis of the cytotoxic plant metabolite denobilone A.

         <title>Didepside Formation by the Nonreducing Polyketide Synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera Requires Interaction of Starter Acyl Transferase and Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ester&#8208;bond&#8208;forming dimerization to afford the didepside lecanoric acid is shown to require both the starter acyltransferase and the thioesterase domains of the nonreducing polyketide synthase Preu6 of the fungus Preussia isomera. These domains also engage in an unexpected, direct protein&#8211;protein interaction that must be considered when attempting combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.







Abstract
Orsellinic acid (OA) derivatives are produced by filamentous fungi using nonreducing polyketide synthases (nrPKSs). The chain&#8208;releasing thioesterase (TE) domains of such nrPKSs were proposed to also catalyze dimerization to yield didepsides, such as lecanoric acid. Here, we use combinatorial domain exchanges, domain dissections and reconstitutions to reveal that the TE domain of the lecanoric acid synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera must collaborate with the starter acyl transferase (SAT) domain from the same nrPKS. We show that artificial SAT&#8208;TE fusion proteins are highly effective catalysts and reprogram the ketide homologation chassis to form didepsides. We also demonstrate that dissected SAT and TE domains of Preu6 physically interact, and SAT and TE domains of OA&#8208;synthesizing nrPKSs may co&#8208;evolve. Our work highlights an unexpected domain&#8211;domain interaction in nrPKSs that must be considered for the combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.

         <title>Overall Carbon&#8208;neutral Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Molten Salts using a Liquid Metal Sn Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts is established by using liquid metal Sn cathode due to enhanced CO2 conversion and excellent energy&#8208;storage capability of Sn@C.







Abstract
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral CO2 electroreduction requires enhanced conversion efficiency and intensified functionality of CO2&#8208;derived products to balance the carbon footprint from CO2 electroreduction against fixed CO2. A liquid Sn cathode is herein introduced into electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts to fabricate core&#8211;shell Sn&#8722;C spheres (Sn@C). An in situ generated Li2SnO3/C directs a self&#8208;template formation of Sn@C. Benefitting from the accelerated reaction kinetics from the liquid Sn cathode and the core&#8211;shell structure of Sn@C, a CO2&#8208;fixation current efficiency higher than 84&#8201;% and a high reversible lithium&#8208;storage capacity of Sn@C are achieved. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by other low melting point metals, such as Zn and Bi. This process integrates energy&#8208;efficient CO2 conversion and template&#8208;free fabrication of value&#8208;added metal&#8208;carbon, achieving an overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2.

         <title>Planar Chiral Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two efficient planar chiral multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent compounds showing narrow emissions and circularly polarized luminescence were prepared. The sky&#8208;blue circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diode exhibited the narrowest emission and high external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;%, and the first nearly pure green circularly polarized electroluminescence was realized. Both devices display g factors at 10&#8722;3 level.







Abstract
Chiral boron/nitrogen doped multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising for highly efficient and color&#8208;pure circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Herein, we report two pairs of MR&#8208;TADF materials (Czp&#8208;tBuCzB, Czp&#8208;POAB) based on planar chiral paracyclophane with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The enantiomers showed symmetric circularly polarized photoluminescence spectra with dissymmetry factors |gPL| of up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;3 in doped films. Meanwhile, the sky&#8208;blue CP&#8208;OLEDs with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;tBuCzB showed an external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;% with the narrowest full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 24&#8197;nm among the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs, while the devices with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;POAB displayed the first nearly pure green CP electroluminescence with |gEL| factors at the 10&#8722;3 level. These results demonstrate the incorporation of planar chirality into MR&#8208;TADF emitter is a reliable strategy for constructing of efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Fluorogenic Inhibitor of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuOCou is a novel fluorogenic inhibitor of the mitochondria calcium uniporter (MCU). Its aquation&#8208;activated increase in MCU&#8208;inhibitory activity can be visualized directly by a concomitant enhancement in fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Inhibitors of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) are valuable tools for studying the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in various pathophysiological conditions. In this study, a new fluorogenic MCU inhibitor, RuOCou, is presented. This compound is an analogue of the known MCU inhibitor Ru265 that contains fluorescent axial coumarin carboxylate ligands. Upon aquation of RuOCou and release of the axial coumarin ligands, a simultaneous increase in its MCU&#8208;inhibitory activity and fluorescence intensity is observed. The fluorescence response of this compound enabled its aquation to be monitored in both HeLa cell lysates and live HeLa cells. This fluorogenic prodrug represents a potential theranostic MCU inhibitor that can be leveraged for the treatment of human diseases related to MCU activity.

         <title>Biodegradable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene&#8208;like Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While it resembles high density polyethylene with regard to its mechanical properties and solid&#8208;state structure and has a high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C), the novel polyester&#8208;2,18 material at the same time fully hydrolyzes in in vitro enzymatic degradation studies and mineralizes under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) within two months.







Abstract
We report a novel polyester material generated from readily available biobased 1,18&#8208;octadecanedicarboxylic acid and ethylene glycol possesses a polyethylene&#8208;like solid&#8208;state structure and also tensile properties similar to high density polyethylene (HDPE). Despite its crystallinity, high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C) and hydrophobic nature, polyester&#8208;2,18 is subject to rapid and complete hydrolytic degradation in in vitro assays with isolated naturally occurring enzymes. Under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) the material is biodegraded with mineralization above 95&#8201;% within two months. Reference studies with polyester&#8208;18,18 (Tm=99&#8201;&#176;C) reveal a strong impact of the nature of the diol repeating unit on degradation rates, possibly related to the density of ester groups in the amorphous phase. Depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenane&#8208;based catalysts that can be activated &#8216;on&#8208;demand&#8217; through the controlled breakdown of the mechanical bond have been developed. Encapsulation of the CuI ion within the cavity formed by the two interlocked macrocycles inhibits its ability to catalyze the CuAAC reaction. However, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture by the opening of the macrocycles restores the capacity of the copper catalyst to form triazoles.







Abstract
Rotaxanes and molecular knots exhibit particular properties resulting from the presence of a mechanical bond within their structure that maintains the molecular components interlocked in a permanent manner. On the other hand, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture through the breakdown of the mechanical bond can activate properties which are masked in the parent compound. Herein, we present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenanes as OFF/ON catalysts for the copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. The encapsulation of the CuI ion inside the [2]catenanes inhibits its ability to catalyze the formation of triazoles. In contrast, the controlled opening of the two macrocycles induces the breaking of the mechanical bond, thereby restoring the catalytic activity of the CuI ion for the CuAAC reaction. Such OFF/ON catalysts can be involved in signal amplification processes with various potential applications.

         <title>Programming Photodegradability into Vinylic Polymers via Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic allylic sulfides were obtained through intramolecular photocycloaddition of coumarin under UVA light. Subsequent radical ring&#8208;opening copolymerization with MA using RAFT, incorporated the coumarin dimers into the backbone of polymers. By decreasing the irradiation wavelength to UVB light or exposing the polymer to sun light, the photocycloreversion of the imbedded coumarin dimers initiated photodegradation of the polymer.







Abstract
Incorporation of photolabile moieties into the polymer backbone holds promise to remotely&#8208;control polymer degradation. However, suitable synthetic avenues are limited, especially for radical polymerizations. Here we report a strategy to program photodegradability into vinylic polymers by exploiting the wavelength selectivity of photocycloadditions for radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP). Irradiation of coumarin terminated allylic sulfides with UVA light initiated intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition producing cyclic macromonomers. Subsequent RAFT&#8208;mediated rROP with methyl acrylate yielded copolymers that inherited the photoreactivity of the cyclic parent monomer. Irradiation with UVB initiated efficient photocycloreversion of the coumarin dimers, causing polymer degradation within minutes under UVB light or days under sunlight exposure. Our synthetic strategy may pave the way to insert photolabile linkages into vinylic polymers, tuning degradation for specific wavelengths.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of photolabile moieties into the polymer backbone holds promise to remotely-control polymer degradation. However, suitable synthetic avenues are limited, especially for radical polymerizations. Here we report a strategy to program photodegradability into vinylic polymers by exploiting the wavelength selectivity of photocycloadditions for radical ring-opening polymerization (rROP). Irradiation of coumarin terminated allylic sulfides with UVA light initiated intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition producing cyclic macromonomers. Subsequent RAFT-mediated rROP with methyl acrylate yielded copolymers that inherited the photoreactivity of the cyclic parent monomer. Irradiation with UVB initiated efficient photocycloreversion of the coumarin dimers, causing polymer degradation within minutes under UVB light or days under sunlight exposure. Our synthetic strategy may pave the way to insert photolabile linkages into vinylic polymers, tuning degradation for specific wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Kinetics Support a Second Coordination Sphere Mechanism in Metal&#8208;Based Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Mo/W formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) is debated because the metal ion of the active site is 6&#8208;coordinated, leaving no coordination site open for substrate binding. We have used direct electrochemistry to investigate the catalytic cycle of two homologous FDHs: our results strongly support a &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based formate dehydrogenases are molybdenum or tungsten&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between formate and CO2. According to the current consensus, the metal ion of the catalytic center in its active form is coordinated by 6&#8201;S (or 5&#8201;S and 1&#8201;Se) atoms, leaving no free coordination sites to which formate could bind to the metal. Some authors have proposed that one of the active site ligands decoordinates during turnover to allow formate binding. Another proposal is that the oxidation of formate takes place in the second coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we have used electrochemical steady&#8208;state kinetics to elucidate the order of the steps in the catalytic cycle of two formate dehydrogenases. Our results strongly support the &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; hypothesis.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosides by Silver&#8208;Assisted Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8208;assisted gold catalysis was applied to alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors for the synthesis of purine, pyrimidine, quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one, and asparagine glycosides. It was demonstrated (40 examples) to be highly versatile for the synthesis of important types of N&#8208;glycosides. The method has been utilized for the synthesis of various 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and the disaccharide dipeptide moiety of chloroviruses.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8208;glycosides from stable glycosyl donors in a catalytic fashion is still challenging, though they exist ubiquitously in DNA, RNA, glycoproteins, and other biological molecules. Herein, silver&#8208;assisted gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors is shown to be a versatile approach for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, asparagine glycosides and quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one N&#8208;glycosides. Thus synthesized nucleosides were subjected to the oxidation&#8211;reduction sequence for the conversion of Ribf&#8208; into Araf&#8208; nucleosides, giving access to nucleosides that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, the protocol is demonstrated to be suitable for the synthesis of 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides in a facile manner. Direct attachment of an asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptide to the glucopyranose and subsequent extrapolation to afford the dipeptide disaccharide unit of chloroviruses is yet another facet of this endeavor.

         <title>Schlenk's Legacy&#8212;Methyllithium Put under Close Scrutiny</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide contaminations of commercial methyllithium solutions (MeLi&#8208;c) can be simply removed by the use of K [N (SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent and solvent&#8208;dependent precipitation. 7Li&#8208;NMR spectroscopy is an efficient tool for quantifying the halide contaminations, which can effect solid&#8208;state structures as shown for monomeric [(Me3TACN)LiCH3].







Abstract
Commercially available stock solutions of organolithium reagents are well&#8208;implemented tools in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, such solutions are inherently contaminated with lithium halide salts, which can complicate certain synthesis protocols and purification processes. Here, we report the isolation of chloride&#8208;free methyllithium employing K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent. The influence of distinct LiCl contaminations on the 7Li&#8208;NMR chemical shift is examined and their quantification demonstrated. The structural parameters of new chloride&#8208;free monomeric methyllithium complex [(Me3TACN)LiCH3], ligated by an azacrown ether, are assessed by comparison with a halide&#8208;contaminated variant and monomeric lithium chloride [(Me3TACN)LiCl], further emphasizing the effect of halide impurities.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenative Desulfurization of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides was developed to selectively cleave the C=S bond. Remarkably, functional groups such as aldehyde, ketone, sulfone, or even nitro could be unprecedentedly tolerated in this manganese&#8208;based protocol and this, despite their sensitivity to reductive conditions.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important alternative to noble transition metal catalysis in hydrogenation reactions. However, there has been no Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides reported so far, presumably due to the poisoning of catalysts by sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, we described the first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides to amines or imines. The key to success is the use of MnBr(CO)5 instead of commonly&#8208;employed pincer&#8208;manganese catalysts, together with simple NEt3 and CuBr. This protocol features excellent selectivity on sole cleavage of the C=S bond of thioamides, in contrast to the only known Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides, and unprecedented chemo&#8208;selectivity tolerating vulnerable functional groups such as nitrile, ketone, aldehyde, ester, sulfone, nitro, olefin, alkyne and heterocycle, which are usually susceptible to common hydride&#8208;type reductive protocols.

         <title>Unconventional Pathway in the Gas&#8208;Phase Synthesis of 9H&#8208;Fluorene (C13H10) via the Radical&#8211;Radical Reaction of Benzyl (C7H7) with Phenyl (C6H5)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>

Gas&#8208;phase synthesis of 9H&#8208;fluorene (C13H10)&#8212;the simplest polycyclic aromatic system carrying a five&#8208;membered ring&#8212;along with diphenylmethane (C13H12) via unconventional reaction dynamics of the benzyl (C7H7&#8901;) with the phenyl (C6H5&#8901;) radical is reported.







Abstract
The simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carrying a five&#8208;membered ring&#8212;9H&#8208;fluorene (C13H10)&#8212;is produced isomer&#8208;specifically in the gas phase by reacting benzyl (C7H7&#8901;) with phenyl (C6H5&#8901;) radicals in a pyrolytic reactor coupled with single photon ionization mass spectrometry. The unconventional mechanism of reaction is supported by theoretical calculations, which first produces diphenylmethane and unexpected 1&#8208;(6&#8208;methylenecyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienyl)benzene intermediates (C13H12) accessed via addition of the phenyl radical to the ortho position of the benzyl radical. These findings offer convincing evidence for molecular mass growth processes defying conventional wisdom that radical&#8208;radical reactions are initiated through recombination at their radical centers.

&lt;p&gt;Gas-phase synthesis of 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluorene (C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8212;the simplest polycyclic aromatic system carrying a five-membered ring&#8212;along with diphenylmethane (C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) via unconventional reaction dynamics of the benzyl (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) with the phenyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) radical is reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carrying a five-membered ring&#8212;9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluorene (C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8212;is produced isomer-specifically in the gas phase by reacting benzyl (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) with phenyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) radicals in a pyrolytic reactor coupled with single photon ionization mass spectrometry. The unconventional mechanism of reaction is supported by theoretical calculations, which first produces diphenylmethane and unexpected 1-(6-methylenecyclohexa-2,4-dienyl)benzene intermediates (C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) accessed via addition of the phenyl radical to the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; position of the benzyl radical. These findings offer convincing evidence for molecular mass growth processes defying conventional wisdom that radical-radical reactions are initiated through recombination at their radical centers. The structure of 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-fluorene acts as a molecular building block for complex curved nanostructures like fullerenes and nanobowls providing fundamental insights into the hydrocarbon evolution in high temperature settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Transmembrane Transport of Exogenous Lithium Ions through Rationally Designed Supramolecular Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial Li+ channels composed of pore&#8208;forming small aromatic molecules show almost exclusive transport of exogenous lithium ions over major physiological cations, with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium ions have been applied in the clinic in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In this work, we report artificial supramolecular lithium channels composed of pore&#8208;containing small aromatic molecules. By adjusting the lumen size and coordination numbers, we found that one of the supramolecular channels developed shows unprecedented transmembrane transport of exogenous lithium ions with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0, which is in the same level of that of natural Na+ channels. Furthermore, four coordination sites inside channels are found to be the basic requirement for ion transport function. Importantly, this artificial lithium channel displays very low transport of physiological Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions, especially in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed formal [6;2] annulation of allenyl benzoxazinanones with terminal allenes has been developed, forming the challenging 8&#8208;membered cycles. Decent yields and excellent regioselectivity have been observed under mild conditions with a remarkable Z&#8208;stereoselectivity for the exo&#8208;cyclic C=C bonds.







Abstract
An efficient double allene protocol for the formation of benzazocines has been developed. The reaction constitutes a highly regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed formal [6+2] annulation of allenyl benzoxazinanones with terminal allenes forming the challenging 8&#8208;membered cycles. Decent yields and excellent regioselectivity have been observed under mild conditions with a remarkable Z&#8208;stereoselectivity for the exo&#8208;cyclic C=C bonds. The synthetic potentials of benzazocine products have been demonstrated.
