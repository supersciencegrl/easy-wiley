         <title>Tunable Catalytic Vertex Wall Chemistry in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) because of their unique structural properties and notable stability. To enhance both catalytic activity and selectivity, a variety of linkers and linkages have been investigated in efforts to precisely engineer COFs. However, the impact of vertex structures within COFs on ORR catalysis remains largely underexplored. Here, to modulate COF catalytic performance, we introduce tunable catalytic vertex wall chemistry by introducing diverse triazine and thiophene units. The catalytic vertex wall approach allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic surface states, leading to improved intermediate adsorption characteristics and accelerated ORR activity. Remarkably, the engineered COF achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V, surpassing COFs modified by linker or linkage strategies. Theoretical calculations suggest that this enhanced activity arises from the strong binding affinity of OOH* intermediates to carbon atoms adjacent to the thiophene vertex, facilitating OOH* reduction to a O2 molecule, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the ORR. These findings reveal the pivotal role of vertex wall engineering in conjugated COF frameworks, and offer critical insights to advance COFs design toward superior ORR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Extended Bipolar Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. Two&#8208; and threefold&#8208;fused bipolar dyes based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide and various electron&#8208;rich motifs were synthesized by a facile and efficient cascade process with cesium carbonate. These polyaromatic systems could not be obtained by transition&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
The development of straightforward synthetic methods for photoactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that avoid Pd&#8208;catalyzed or radical&#8208;based processes remains a challenge. Such methods are essential to reducing the cost and environmental impact of organic photodevices. In this work, we present a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for creating novel bipolar PAHs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which are not accessible via conventional Pd&#8208;catalyzed routes. Our cascade process operates exclusively under basic conditions, utilizing cesium carbonate and molecular sieves to facilitate the coupling of electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;fluoronaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide with halogenated electron&#8208;rich moieties. This results in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective formation of new 6&#8208; and/or 5&#8208;membered conjugated rings via consecutive SNAr reactions, as confirmed through experimental and computational studies. The resulting PAHs exhibit strong emissive properties, with quantum yields ranging from 34&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. This work provides a simple and efficient synthetic strategy for producing novel semiconducting materials, offering a new framework for designing bipolar PAHs with distinct optical characteristics.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Metal&#8208;Organic Layer on Polyoxometalate&#8208;etching Cu2O to Boost CO2 Reduction with High Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
POM&#8208;etching for in situ growth of metal&#8208;organic layer can simultaneously incorporate electron sponge and protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites exhibit exceptional robustness and achieve efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH with a yield 55 times higher than that of binary Cu2O@HKUST.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;etching and in situ growth of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron&#8208;sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM=PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt;x&#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60&#8197;h without noticeable activity loss.

         <title>Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the potential of DESs for practical applications, we propose a novel competition coordination strategy for designing the ternary DESs, which can reinforce the construction of H&#8208;bond interaction and facilitate the exsolution of the ligand (OxA), leading to an enhanced mass transfer kinetic and an excellent selective precipitation of metals (Ni).







Abstract
The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal&#8208;oxygen (MO6) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8211;liquid ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5&#8201;% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals&#8208;oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing&#8208;ligand (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36&#8201;% to 17.76&#8201;% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O product (~95.7&#8201;% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.

         <title>Adjusting TADF and Phosphorescence for Tailored Dynamic Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Colored Carbon Dots spanning Full Visible Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a convenient strategy to achieve TDAC CDs that cover the entire visible region. By optimizing the doping level of Pyr&#8208;CDs and embedding them in different rigid matrices, we can effectively tailor various color variations of the afterglow within the visible region. The successful utilization of 4D coding technique for multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption promotes the practical applications of afterglow materials.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;level encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)&#8208;based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long&#8208; and short&#8208;wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface&#8208;rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Confining Phosphoric Acid in Quaternized COF Channels for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs) with different positively charged groups were fabricated. The strong confinement effect affords ultrahigh H3PO4 retention capability under hydration condition, and the suitable H&#8208;bond length between H3PO4 and highly interconnected H&#8208;bond network enables ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport.







Abstract
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) doping is a widely employed strategy to facilitate anhydrous proton transport in high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). However, significant H3PO4 leaching during long&#8208;term operation poses critical challenges to maintaining membrane stability and proton conductivity. Herein, H3PO4 is incorporated into positively charged nanochannels of quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs), leveraging strong electrostatic interactions and confinement effects to achieve exceptional H3PO4 retention under hydration conditions. Moreover, the shortened hydrogen bond length between H3PO4 (O&#8722;H&#8230;O &lt;2.7&#8201;&#197;) and the highly interconnected hydrogen bond network in the H3PO4@QACOFMs facilitate ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport. As a result, the H3PO4@QACOFMs exhibit superior anhydrous proton transport in a broader temperature range (60&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C) and the highest proton conductivity reaches about 379.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field Strength in Ru/RuO2 Interfaces through Ni Doping to Enhance Hydrogen Conversion at Ampere&#8208;level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use DFT calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni&#8208;RuO2 is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO2 to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface with a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.







Abstract
Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere&#8208;level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO2, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface having a significant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over a 1000&#8208;hour period.

         <title>CO Adsorption on a Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Stably Embedded in Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the chemical activity of isolated metal atoms confined in graphene on Ni(111), using carbon monoxide as a probe molecule. At room temperature, CO stably adsorbs on Co but not on Ni. Electronic descriptors clarify this behavior, offering valuable insights for designing graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Confined single metal atoms in graphene&#8208;based materials have proven to be excellent catalysts for several reactions and promising gas sensing systems. However, whether the chemical activity arises from the specific type of metal atom or is a direct consequence of the confinement itself remains unclear.

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorescence Behavior of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes from the Perspective of Excited State Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide complexes has been synthesized. The doped PMMA films demonstrate a light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence phenomenon. Our research reveals that these complexes exhibit a long phosphorescence lifetime, a high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate, and significant phosphorescence intensity. These three characteristics enable the phosphorescence of the CMA complex&#8208;doped films to be activated by light, allowing for a change in the emission color of the films.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A novel type of carbene-metal-amide complexes has been synthesized. The doped PMMA films demonstrate a light-induced dynamic phosphorescence phenomenon. Our research reveals that these complexes exhibit a long phosphorescence lifetime, a high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate, and significant phosphorescence intensity. These three characteristics enable the phosphorescence of the CMA complex-doped films to be activated by light, allowing for a change in the emission color of the films.

         <title>New Thermoplastic Elastomers based on Ethylene&#8208;Butadiene&#8208;Rubber (EBR) by Switching from Anionic to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermoplastic elastomers: Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene, ethylene butadiene rubber and highly crystalline polyethylene segments are prepared using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization. They display low&#8208;viscosity above the melting point of PE and high elastic performances upon crystallization of PE segments.







Abstract
Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene (PS), ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) and highly crystalline polyethylene (PE) segments were prepared for the first time using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization (CCT(co)P). PS chains obtained by anionic polymerization were transmetalated with mesitylmagnesium bromide (BrMgMes) to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macro&#8208;CTA, PS&#8208;MgMes) in the CCTcoP of ethylene and butadiene using {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex (1). Further chain extension by CCTP using pure ethylene in the monomer feed afforded well&#8208;defined PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE triblock copolymers. The structural, rheological and mechanical properties of these materials demonstrate excellent balance between properties and easy processability at moderate temperatures (&gt;150&#8201;&#176;C). We demonstrate that such triblock copolymers behave effectively as low&#8208;viscosity PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR diblock copolymers above the melting point of PE domains and high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) upon crystallization of PE segments.

         <title>Enzymatic Cascades for Stereoselective and Regioselective Amide Bond Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes catalyse amide formation in an environmentally friendly manner. This study advances the application of ABS by integrating these enzymes with other compatible biocatalysts, creating enantioselective and scalable cascade reactions to produce valuable amide products from abundant nitrile precursors. Furthermore, two innovative methods for C&#8722;H bond amidation of aromatic compounds are introduced.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is fundamental in nature and is widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Current methods for amide synthesis are often step and atom inefficient, requiring the use of protecting groups, deleterious reagents and organic solvents that create significant waste. The development of cleaner and more efficient catalytic methods for amide synthesis remains an urgent unmet need. Herein, we present novel biocatalytic cascade reactions for synthesising various amides under mild aqueous conditions from readily available organic nitriles combining nitrile hydrolysing enzymes and amide bond synthetase enzymes. These cooperative biocatalytic cascades enable kinetic resolution of racemic nitriles and provide a highly enantioselective biocatalytic extension of the Strecker reaction. The regioselective non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple arenes was demonstrated through the incorporation of photoredox catalysis to the front end of the cascade. C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO2 fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one&#8208;pot.

         <title>Isolation and Structure Elucidation of the Heterocumulene Anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; (L=CO, CS, N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cumulated 5&#8208;atomic cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and thioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722; were synthesized from the metalated ylide and ketenyl anion, respectively. Both anions exhibit unexpected stability, but with notable structural differences. While the cyanodiazomethanide features a distinctly bent geometry, the thioketenyl anion was found to be linear, which can be explained by to the stronger &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the CS ligand.







Abstract
Cumulenes are molecules characterized by a series of consecutive double bonds. They serve as important reagents and intermediates in the synthesis of polymers and a wide variety of functionalized compounds, including various heterocycles. Understanding the properties of cumulenes and developing synthetic routes to these often highly reactive species is essential for unlocking new applications. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of the cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and cyanothioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722;. These 5&#8208;atomic anions exhibit unexpected stabilities but distinct structural differences. Despite the explosive nature of diazoacetonitrile, the [NCCNN]&#8722; anion was sufficiently stable at 0&#8201;&#176;C to allow for first reactivity studies and its structure elucidation revealing a bent structure. The thioketenyl anion is stable at room&#8208;temperature and can be accessed from the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722; via a [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion sequence with COS elimination. Comparative structural, spectroscopic and computational studies including those on the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722;, demonstrate that the degree of bending of these heterocumulene anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; can be explained by a transition in the bonding situation from a cumulene structure to an anionic carbone, with the strongly &#960; accepting CS ligand leading to a linear structure of the thioketenyl anion.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Blue Narrowband OLED Devices with External Quantum Efficiency Beyond 35&#8201;% through Horizontal Dipole Orientation Induced by Electrostatic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host (8CzTPS) with a strong positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and a dendritic emitter (D2&#8208;DBN) with multiple negative ESP sites was used to induce a high horizontal dipole orientation of 83.0&#8201;% for the emitter in solution&#8208;processed films. The resulting blue narrowband device realizes an external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) device has drawn great attention due to their outstanding efficiency and color purity. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed MR&#8208;TADF devices is still far behind their vacuum&#8208;deposited counterparts, due to the uncontrollable horizontal emitting dipole orientation for emitters during solution process, resulting in low light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy namely electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host with high positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and dendritic emitter with multiple negative ESP sites, which could induce high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;||) up to 83.0&#8201;% in solution&#8208;processed films. For this couple, the largest plane of dendritic host tends to anchor on the substrate, and thus the strong positive electrostatic site mainly lies at the exposed tetraphenylsilicon, which could electrostatically attract the multiple negative electrostatic sites of the dendritic emitter, realizing horizontal dipole orientation. Moreover, the highly twisted structure of dendritic host and dendron encapsulation of emitter could effectively suppress aggregation, leading a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.6&#8201;%. As a result, the solution&#8208;processed blue MR&#8208;TADF devices exhibit a record&#8208;break external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;%, as well as narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.176).

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Peptides Directed by a Removable, Backbone&#8208;Inserted Amidoxime Ether</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides has been developed, directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. The backbone&#8208;installed directing group facilitates site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides, including at internal residues. Removal of the amidoxime ether generates the parent amide enabling a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.







Abstract
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted considerable attention as a pathway to late&#8208;stage modification of peptides. Herein, we report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be easily incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. Site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides has been achieved, including unprecedented functionalization of internal residues of native peptides. Removal of the amidoxime ether was achieved to generate the parent amide and facilitate a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers Incorporating Shape&#8208;Persistent Cyclobenzoin Macrocycles for Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic porous organic polymer has been synthesized for the efficient separation of organic solvents. The resulting polymer exhibits high uptake capacities for small solvents, correlating with their kinetic diameters, and effectively differentiates between xylene isomers. These findings highlight the potential of porous organic polymers in advanced solvent separation technologies.







Abstract
The recovery and separation of organic solvents is highly important for the chemical industry and environmental protection. In this context, porous organic polymers (POPs) have significant potential owing to the possibility of integrating shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units with high guest selectivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a macrocyclic porous organic polymer (np&#8208;POP) and the corresponding model compound by reacting the cyclotetrabenzil naphthalene octaketone macrocycle with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene and 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene, respectively, under solvothermal conditions. Co&#8208;crystallization of the macrocycle and the model compound with various solvent molecules revealed their size&#8208;selective inclusion within the macrocycle. Building on this finding, the np&#8208;POP with a hierarchical pore structure and a surface area of 579&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 showed solvent uptake strongly correlated with their kinetic diameters. Solvents with kinetic diameters below 0.6&#8197;nm &#8211; such as acetonitrile and dichloromethane &#8211; showed high uptake capacities exceeding 7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Xylene separation tests revealed a high overall uptake (~34&#8197;wt&#8201;%), with o&#8208;xylene displaying a significantly lower uptake (~10&#8197;wt&#8201;% less than other isomers), demonstrating the possibility of size and shape selective separation of organic solvents.

         <title>Tunable Organic&#8208;Inorganic p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d Electron Conjugation Triggers d&#8208;&#960; Hybridization in Quinonized MnO2 Superlattice toward Ultrastable and High&#8208;Rate Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The tunable organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d electron conjugation of quinonized superlattice, inducing more dxy orbitals occupancy, more polarons near Fermi level, the downshift of O p band center, and reinforced Mn&#8722;O &#960;&#8208;type orbitals hybrid, which successively contributes to the significant improvement of electrochemical activity, diffusion kinetics of Zn2+ and structure stability.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with two&#8208;electron transfer harvest high energy density, high working voltage, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Zn2+ as the dominant charge carriers suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the strong Zn2+&#8722;MnO2 coulombic interaction, which is also the origin of pestilent MnO2 lattice deformation and performance degradation. Current studies particularly involve H+ insertion&#8208;dominating chemistry, where the long&#8208;term cycle stability remains challenging due to the accumulative Zn2+ insertion and structural collapse. Herein, a simultaneously enhanced and stabilized Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry is proposed by the quinone&#8208;hybridized MnO2 superlattice, a first&#8208;of&#8208;this&#8208;kind structure with a distinctive organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d conjugation, which enables a tunable interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization. Theoretical and experimental results substantiate that the interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization triggers the enhancement of polarons occupancy near Fermi level, the downward shift of O p&#8208;band center, the elevated Mn t2g occupation and thus improved [MnO6] stability upon unprecedentedly high Zn2+ contribution. The notable d&#8208;&#960; hybridization endows MnO2 superlattice an ultrahigh specific capacity (435.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) with substantially enhanced rate performance. Our findings enlighten a new paradigm in the adjustment of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry towards high&#8208;performance rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerizing plastic waste through hydrogen&#8208;based processes, such as hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking, presents a promising solution for converting plastics into liquid fuels. However, conventional hydrogen production methods rely heavily on fossil fuels, exacerbating global warming. This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste hydrogenolysis that utilizes in situ hydrogen generated via the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol, a biomass&#8208;derived chemical offering a more sustainable alternative. Our results show that a bimetallic Ru&#8208;Pt/TiO2 catalyst achieved high conversion (85.1%) and selectivity (81.0%) towards liquid fuels and lubricant oils in a tandem process combining polyethylene (PE) hydrogenolysis and methanol APR. By tuning the metal loading, we identified that Pt enhances hydrogen production through methanol APR, while Ru drives C&#8211;C bond cleavage, which is crucial for PE hydrogenolysis. Isotope labeling analysis confirmed that hydrogen generated from methanol APR is effectively utilized in the PE hydrogenolysis reaction. This method was also successfully applied to post&#8208;consumer polyolefin waste, with selectivity toward valuable products ranging from 75.0% to 88.9%. This study highlights an innovative strategy to reduce reliance on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen in plastic waste depolymerization, promoting both sustainability and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Actinide Oxo&#8208;Bond Manipulation in Actinyl Thiacalix[4]arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the chemistry of the inert actinide oxo bond in actinyl ions AnO22+ is important for controlling actinide behavior in the environment, during separations, and in nuclear waste (An = U, Np, Pu).  The thioether calixarene TC4A (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetrathiacalix[4]arene) binds equatorially to [AnO2]n+ (An = U, Np) forming a conical pocket that differentiates the two trans&#8208;oxo groups. The &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, [A]2[UO2(TC4A)] (A = [Li(DME)2], HNEt3) and [HNEt3]2[NpO2(TC4A)], enable selective oxo chemistry. Silylation of the UVI oxo groups by bis(trimethylsilyl)pyrazine occurs first at only the unencapsulated exo oxo and only one silylation is needed to enable migration of the endo oxo out of the cone, whereupon a second silylation affords the stable UIV cis&#8208;bis(siloxide) [A]2[U(OSiMe3)2(TC4A)]. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate&#160;oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8208; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically, at only 23 kcal.mol&#8208;1 in energy above the classical trans dioxo. The aryloxide (OAr) groups of the macrocycle are essential in stabilizing this as&#8208;yet unseen uranyl geometry, with further bonding in the TC4A U&#8208;OAr groups stabilizing the U=O &#8216;yl&#8217; bonds, explaining the stability of a calculated cis[UO2(TC4A)]2&#8208; in this ligand framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminadichalcogeniranes and Aluminatrichalcogenetanes: Heavier Analogs of Dioxiranes and Trioxetanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dioxiranes and their heavier chalcogen analogs have long been recognized as pivotal reagents and intermediates in synthetic chemistry, while trioxetanes have largely remained theoretical constructs. In this work, we present the synthesis of neutral, isoelectronic aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, specifically aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and a mixed Se/Te analog of aluminatrichalcogenetane. These compounds, featuring strained AlCh2 and AlCh3 ring (Ch = Se, Te), exhibit significant polarization between the aluminum and chalcogen components. Reactivity studies have revealed that both aluminadiselenirane and aluminaditellurirane show pronounced ambiphilic behavior when interacting with proximal substrates, undergoing facile ring&#8208;opening (cyclo)additions. Additionally, the coordination chemistry of aluminatriselenetane with a Lewis acid has been documented. These investigations not only broaden the repertoire of unique main group species but also provide access to heterocyclic structures that present synthetic challenges through conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Stepwise Reduction of Aliphatic Carboxylic Esters to Aldehydes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes and alcohols is a fundamental functional group transformation in chemistry. However, the inertness of carbonyl group and the instability of ketyl radical anion intermediate impede the reduction of carboxylic esters via photochemical strategy. Herein, we described the reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters with synergistic dual photocatalysis via phenolate&#8208;catalyzed single electron transfer process and thiol&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer process. The competitive back electron transfer process was effectively inhibited by protonation of the ketyl&#8208;type radical anion. This protocol enabled the efficient reduction of carboxylic esters to alcohols under mild conditions. By interruption of the reduction with prolinol, the step&#8208;controlled reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes was accomplished. The developed process was also successfully applied to the preparation of deuterated alcohols and aldehydes from esters with D2O as the deuterium source.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Substitution Strategy for Enhanced Mobility, Tunable Bandgap, and Improved Electrochemical Energy Storage in Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs), a novel class of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, are distinguished by their unique structural characteristics and exceptional charge transport properties. The electronic properties of these materials are critically determined by the constituting coordination atoms, with electron&#8208;rich selenol ligands emerging as promising candidates for constructing high&#8208;mobility semiconducting c&#8208;CPs. Currently,&#160;c&#8208;CPs incorporating selenium&#8208;substituted ligands remain scarce. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new tetraseleno&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ) ligand using a &#8220;4+2&#8221; design strategy and developed a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;Se coordination polymer, Ag4TSHQ. Ag4TSHQ exhibits room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity of up to 1.6 S/m and shares the same structural topology as Ag4TTHQ (TTHQ = tetrathiol&#8208;hydroxyquinone), enabling precise bandgap modulation from 0.6 eV to 1.5 eV via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. Time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy reveals that the charge mobility of Ag4TSHQ in the dc limit is ~350 cm2/V&#8901;s, which is twice that of its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ. Furthermore, our evaluations of their electrochemical energy storage capabilities demonstrate that Ag4TSHQ effectively utilizes its redox potential, achieving a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 340 F/g&#8212;significantly outperforming Ag4TTHQ, which has a capacitance of 294 F/g. These findings underscore the potential of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs for optoelectronic applications and energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Introduction of sp3&#160;Quantum Defects in Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over low&#8208;dimensional materials holds an immense potential for their applications in sensing, imaging and information processing. The controlled introduction of sp3 quantum defects (color centers) can be used to tailor the optoelectronic properties of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the tissue transparency (&gt;&#160;800&#160;nm) and the telecommunication window. However, an uncontrolled functionalization of SWCNTs with defects leads to a loss of the NIR fluorescence. Here, we use mechanochemistry with aryldiazonium salts to create quantum defects in SWCNTs. The reaction proceeds within 5&#160;min without solvents or illumination and can be controlled by a varied mechanochemical energy impact. By working in the solid&#8208;state, this method presents an alternative synthetic route and marks a crucial step for tailoring photophysics of SWCNTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Olympic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catenated networks exclusively composed of intertwining rings were first envisioned as "Olympic gels"&#160;by Pierre&#8208;Gilles de Gennes four decades ago but have not been successfully prepared in artificial materials yet due to the challenge in synthesis. Herein, we present a bio&#8208;inspired, evaporation&#8208;assisted strategy to address this issue. In our design, the evaporation of liquid catalysts that induce ring&#8208;chain equilibrium of polymer systems drives macrocycles to encounter and assists their catenation through reversible cyclization. Complete removal of liquid catalysts stabilizes the resulting ring&#8208;interlocked networks by deactivating the catenation&#8208;decatenation process. The strategy is demonstrated by the system of hydroxyethyl lipoate (LpHE) and dimethyl formamide (DMF). The results indicate that DMF evaporation leads to the formation of global LpHE polycatenane networks.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Catenated networks exclusively composed of intertwining rings were first envisioned as "Olympic gels"&#160;by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes four decades ago but have not been successfully prepared in artificial materials yet due to the challenge in synthesis. Herein, we present a bio-inspired, evaporation-assisted strategy to address this issue. In our design, the evaporation of liquid catalysts that induce ring-chain equilibrium of polymer systems drives macrocycles to encounter and assists their catenation through reversible cyclization. Complete removal of liquid catalysts stabilizes the resulting ring-interlocked networks by deactivating the catenation-decatenation process.

         <title>Super Strong Bonding at the interface between ETL and Perovskite for Robust Flexible Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated great potential for flexible optoelectronic devices due to their superior optoelectronic properties and structural flexibility. However, mechanical deformation&#8208;induced cracks at the buried interface and delamination from the substrate severely constrain the optoelectronic performance and device lifespan. Here, we design a two&#8208;site bonding strategy aiming to reinforce the mechanical stability of the SnO2/perovskite interface and perovskite layer using a multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH). This approach significantly enhances the bonding at the buried interface between the electronic transport layer and perovskite layer, which is demonstrated by TPH&#8208;modified SnO2/perovskite interface remaining intact after 10,000 bending cycles. Meanwhile, TPH mitigates void formation, enhances perovskite crystallinity at the buried interface, and inhibits ion migration inside the devices. Furthermore, incorporating TPH in perovskite bulk decreases the nucleation activation energy and accelerates nucleation, leading to high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.64% and 23.61% are achieved for target flexible and rigid perovskite solar cells, respectively. The target flexible device retained 92.3% of its initial PCE after 25,000 bending cycles. This approach provides a robust solution for enhancing the mechanical durability of flexible perovskite optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Converting Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalyst to a new FeNxSey cluster catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is the most promising alternative to platinum catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), however its high performance cannot be maintained for a long enough time in device. The construction of a new Fe coordination environment that is different from the square&#8208;planar Fe&#8211;N 4&#160;configuration in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is expected to break current stability limits, which however remains unexplored. Here, we report the conversion of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C to a new FeNxSey catalyst, where the Fe sites are three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) co&#8208;coordinated by N and Se atoms. The FeNxSey&#160;catalyst exhibits much better 4e&#8211;&#160;ORR activity and selectivity than the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst. Specifically, the yields of H2O2 and &#183;OH radicals on FeNxSey&#160;are only one&#8208;quarter and one&#8208;third of that on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, respectively. Therefore, the FeNxSey&#160;catalyst exhibits outstanding stability, losing only 10 mV in E1/2&#160;after 10,000 cycles, much smaller than that of the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst (56 mV), representing the most stable Pt&#8208;free catalysts ever reported. Moreover, the 3D co&#8208;coordination structure&#160;inhibits the Fe demetallization in the presence of H2O2. As a result, the FeNxSey&#160;based PEMFC shows excellent durability, with the current density attenuation significantly lower than that of the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C based device after accelerated durability testing.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol via Precise Single&#8208;Atom Ir Deposition on Functional P Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol has attracted significant interest because ethanol offers ease of transport and substantial value in chemical synthesis. Here, we present a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol achieved by precisely depositing single&#8208;atom Ir species on P cluster islands situated on the In2O3 nanosheets. The Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst achieves an impressive ethanol yield of 3.33 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 914 h&#8208;1 under 1.0 MPa (H2/CO2 = 3:1) at 180 &#176;C, nearly 8 times higher than that of the unmodified Ir1/In2O3 catalyst. Additionally, at a more industrially relevant pressure of 5.0 MPa, the TOF of the Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst can reach up to 2108 h&#8208;1, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Combined in&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogenation process is significantly enhanced by the Ir1&#8208;Px entities. Specifically, the Ir atom facilitates CO2 activation and C&#8211;C coupling, while the surrounding P island exhibits exceptional H2 dissociation ability. These three steps have been found crucial for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. This discovery opens new opportunities for the regulation of the microenvironment of current catalysts by providing essential chemical functionalities that enhance intricate and complex reaction processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;functionalized&#160;Triazolate&#8208;based&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Diluted CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient CO2 capture at concentrations between 400&#8208;2000 ppm is essential for maintaining air quality in a habitable environment and advancing carbon capture technologies. This study introduces NICS&#8208;24 (National Institute of Chemistry Structures No. 24), a Zn&#8208;oxalate 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate framework with two distinct square&#8208;shaped channels, designed to enhance CO2 capture at indoor&#8208;relevant concentrations. NICS&#8208;24 exhibits a CO2 uptake of 0.7 mmol/g at 2 mbar and 25 &#176;C, significantly outperforming the compositionally related Zn&#8208;oxalate 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate &#8208; CALF&#8208;20 (0.17 mmol/g). Improved performance is attributed to amino&#8208;functions that enhance CO2 binding and enable superior selectivity over N2 and O2, achieving 8&#8208;fold and 30&#8208;fold improvements, respectively, in simulated CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 atmospheric ratios. In humid environments, NICS&#8208;24 retained structural integrity but exhibited an 85 % reduction in CO2 capacity due to competitive water adsorption. Breakthrough sorption experiments, atomistic NMR analysis, and DFT calculations revealed that water preferentially adsorbs over CO2 due to strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the framework. Gained understanding of the interaction between CO2 and H2O within the MOF framework could guide the modification via rational design with improved performance under real&#8208;world conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;enhanced Ion Recognition of Triazine Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;resolution Li+/Mg2+ Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise and rapid extraction of lithium from salt&#8208;lake brines is critical to meeting the global demand for lithium resources. However, it remains a major challenge to design ion&#8208;transport membranes with accurate recognition and fast transport path for the target ion. Here, we report a triazine covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with high resolution for Li+ and Mg2+ that enables fast Li+ transport while almost completely inhibiting Mg2+ permeation. The remarkably high rejection of Mg2+ by the COF membrane is achieved via imposed ion dehydration and the construction of the energy well. The proper hydrophilic environment of the COF channel promotes the dissociation of Li+ from the negatively charged functional groups, allowing Li+ for hopping transport supported by the sulfonate side&#8208;chains to shorten the diffusion path of Li+. Under high&#8208;salinity electrodialysis conditions, the COF membrane demonstrates robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance (No Mg2+ were detected in the collected solution), achieving efficient lithium recovery and high product purity (Li2CO3: 99.3%). This membrane design strategy enables high energy efficiency and powerful lithium extraction in the electrodialysis lithium extraction process, and can be generalized to other energy and separation related membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Needle in a Haystack: Transient Porosity in a Closed Pore Square Lattice Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guest transport through discrete voids (closed pores) in crystalline solids is poorly understood. Herein, we report the gas sorption properties of a nonporous coordination network, [Co(bib)2Cl2]n&#183;2MeOH (sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945;), featuring square lattice (sql) topology and the bent linker 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene (bib). The as&#8208;synthesized sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; has 11.3% (313 &#197;3) of its unit cell volume in closed pores occupied by methanol (MeOH). Upon desolvation and air exposure, sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; underwent a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) phase transformation to sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946;&#8242;, wherein MeOH was replaced by water. Activation (vacuum or N2 flow) resulted in dehydration and retention of the closed pores, affording sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; with 7.7% (194 &#197;3) guest&#8208;accessible space. sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; was found to preferentially adsorb C2H2 (at 265 K) over CO2 (at 195 K) through gate&#8208;opening mechanisms, at gate&#8208;opening pressures of 31.1 and 59.8 kPa, respectively, while other C2 gases were excluded. PXRD was used to monitor transformations between the three phases of sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl, while in situ DSC, in situ SCXRD under CO2 pressure, and computational studies provided insight into the guest transport mechanism, which we attribute to the angular, flexible nature of the bib ligand. Further the preferential adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 and other C2 gases suggests that transiently porous sorbents might have utility in separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Interlocking Mode in Pd4L8 Cage Catenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of Pd2L4 cage leads to formation two distinct Pd4L8 species with different interlocking degree: the classical quadruply interlocked double cage and a novel triply interlocked double cage, representing a previously unreported topology for Pd4L8 complexes. The degree of interlocking and equilibrium in the double cage system can be controlled thermally and through anion exchange.







Abstract
Precise control over the catenation process in interlocked supramolecular systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a system in which a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 cage can dimerize to form two distinct Pd4L8 catenanes with different interlocking degree: a previously described quadruply interlocked double cage motif of D4 symmetry and an unprecedented triply interlocked structure of C2h symmetry. While the former structure features a linear arrangement of four Pd(II) centers, separated by three mechanically linked pockets, the new motif has a staggered shape. Both assemblies are topological isomers, coexisting in equilibrium in solution. The triply interlocked species is thermodynamically more stable due to extended noncovalent interactions between the ligands, as supported by X&#8208;ray structure analysis and electronic structure calculations. Notably, the degree of interlocking in the double cage system can be controlled by a change of temperature and through anion exchange. Cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations were followed by NMR, MS and TIMS methods.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Localization Transfer Regulation in 3D COFs Enhances Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [8+4] 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were developed and applied to photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation for the first time, which expanded the scope of application of 3D COFs and provided new insight into the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts.







Abstract
In this work, a series of new crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on [8+4] construction was designed and successfully realized efficient photocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4). By regulating the hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer effect in these 3D COFs, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;H containing cobalt glyoximate active centers exhibited excellent C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 performance, with an average C2H4 yield of 1755.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure C2H2, also showed near 100&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 in 1&#8201;% C2H2 contained crude C2H4 mixtures (industry&#8208;relevant conditions), and finally obtain polymer grade C2H4. In contrast, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;BF2 only showed one fifth activity due to lack of hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer. The density functional theory (DFT), projected density of states (PDOS) and molecular dynamics &#8220;slow&#8208;growth&#8221; kinetic calculations based on precise 3D COF structures confirmed that the rapid hydrogen species transfer, enhanced water dissociation and suitable C2H2 adsorption in COFs jointly contributed efficient photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (PAH). This work provides new opportunity towards rational design and development of crystalline photocatalysts for C2H2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of a New Class of Minor Immunosuppressive Plant Sesterterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gracilisoids, a new family of plant sesterterpenoids with highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons (named neo&#8208;eurysolanes), were discovered from Eurysolen gracilis. The collective total synthesis of nine gracilisoid members has been accomplished by employing a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization and late&#8208;stage photo&#8208;oxidation as key steps. Immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was also found.







Abstract
Plant sesterterpenoids are an extremely rare family of natural products that generally possess novel chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented group of minor plant sesterterpenoids, gracilisoids B&#8722;E (2&#8211;5), which feature two types of highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons, along with their biogenetically related precursor gracilisoid A (1), from a Lamiaceae ethnomedicinal plant, Eurysolen gracilis. To confirm their structures and obtain adequate materials for biological research, the asymmetric total syntheses of gracilisoids A&#8722;E (1&#8211;5) and four new biogenetically&#8208;related congeners gracilisoids F&#8722;I (6&#8211;9) were achieved from commercially available (&#8722;)&#8208;citronellal by a bioinspired approach that involves a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization/&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone rearrangement tandem reaction and a late&#8208;stage biomimetic photooxidation as key steps. Biological investigations revealed that gracilisoids A&#8722;I (1&#8211;9) significantly inhibited IFN&#8208;&#947; production and/or T cell proliferation probably through inhibition of the STAT pathway. The findings herald the potential of these gracilisoids as novel immunosuppressive agents, and efficient synthetic approaches will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of their value in future drug development.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Guanylation Reaction for Removing MACl Residual and In&#8208;Situ Forming 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) was added into perovskite precursor to solve the issues of methylammonium chloride (MACl) residual and in situ form two&#8208;dimensional perovskite by guanylation reaction between MCH and MACl, thus yielding high quality three&#8208;dimensional perovskite. The MCH&#8208;treated inverted perovskite solar cells realized a 26.81&#8201;%&#8208;efficiency (certified 26.02&#8201;%) with excellent device stability.

The thermodynamical deprotonation of methylammonium chloride (MACl) has several detrimental influences on the quality of formamidinium (FA+)&#8208;based perovskite, which limits both efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Herein, a new additive strategy was developed by introducing methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) into perovskite precursor, where guanylation reaction occurred between MCH and MACl to form a new intermediate of methyl&#8208;substituted guanidine (MSG). MSG could then bond with undercoordinated Pb2+ to in situ form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite, which would promote the growth and crystallization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite with higher crystallinity, lower defect&#8208;states density and superior stability. Finally, the MCH&#8208;treated IPSC with a small area (0.09&#8197;cm2) achieved an impressive power conversation efficiency (PCE) of 26.81&#8201;% (certified as 26.02&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs reported to date. The large area MCH&#8208;treated device (1.00&#8197;cm2) also obtained a high PCE of 24.36&#8201;%. Moreover, the unencapsulated and MCH&#8208;treated device exhibited excellent operational stability, maintaining 91.95&#8201;% and 97.06&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after aging in air and a nitrogen&#8208;filled atmosphere at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h. The encapsulated MCH&#8208;treated devices retained 94.25&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuously tracking at the maximum power&#8208;point for 1200&#8197;h in air.

The optimization of one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence through linker installation in an interpenetrated TPE&#8208;MOF. Both the crystal packing density and ligand conformations can be modulated by linker installation.







Abstract
Immobilizing organic chromophores within the rigid framework of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) augments fluorescence by effectively curtailing molecular motions. Yet, the substantial interspaces and free volumes inherent to MOFs can undermine photoluminescence efficiency, as they partially constrain intramolecular dynamics. In this study, we achieved optimization of both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence by incorporating linkers into an interpenetrated tetraphenylethene&#8208;based MOF (TPE&#8208;MOF). This linker installation strategy enables fine&#8208;tuning of both crystal packing density and ligand conformations. Strikingly, the desolvated MOFs exhibit remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections, reaching an impressive 8801&#8197;GM. Consequently, these materials demonstrate exceptional performance in one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited cellular imaging of HepG2 cells. Our work introduces an innovative approach to enhancing two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and broadens the scope of research into one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (1/2 PEF).

         <title>A photosynthesis&#8208;derived bionic system for sustainable biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process, a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module was proposed for supply of NADPH and ATP in cell factory. The proposed new strategy enables facilitating both CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing and opens the possibility of manufacturing industry revolution driven by sustainable solar energy.







Abstract
&#8220;Cell factory&#8221; strategy based on microbial anabolism pathways offers an intriguing alternative to relieve the dependence on fossil fuels, which are recognized as the main sources of CO2 emission. Typically, anabolism of intracellular substance in cell factory requires the consumption of sufficient reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide /nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD(P)H and adenosine triphosphate ATP. However, it is of great challenge to modify the natural limited anabolism and to increase the insufficient level of NAD(P)H and ATP to optimum concentrations without causing metabolic disorder. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process in which NAD(P)H and ATP can both be produced through the coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer processes driven by sunlight, herein we designed a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module. The proposed strategy of light&#8208;driven bionic system enables for achieving simultaneous and controllable supplies of NAD(P)H and ATP, thus facilitating both highly efficient CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing. The proposed light&#8208;driven bionic system design strategy in this work might pave new sustainable ways for reducing power and energy regeneration to optimize microbial metabolism, offering intriguing alternatives for CO2 emission mitigation and high&#8208;value chemical biomanufacturing.

         <title>Interstitial Doping in Ultrafine Nanocrystals for Efficient and Durable Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy is proposed for preparing heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon. The interstitial C and N atoms regulate the electronic structure of metal sites to promote the adsorption/dissociation process of HER intermediates, and accelerate the formation of high OER activity hydroxyl oxides on the surface.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre&#8208;deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9&#8197;nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption&#8208;dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62&#8197;mV and 237&#8197;mV for the HER and OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. This work presents a new perspective for synthesizing TMISS nanocrystals and promotes their application in bifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <title>Vesicle&#8208;Encapsulated Chemosensing Ensembles Allow Monitoring of Transmembrane Uptake Coupled with Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have encapsulated a host&#8211;guest reporter pair together with three enzymes within vesicles to monitor a two&#8208;compartment cascade reaction which includes transmembrane transport of peptide substrates and their subsequent enzymatic conversion inside the vesicles. Our &#8220;protocell&#8221; system mimics a simplistic cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism cycle. To reflect the various mechanisms of nutrient uptake by cells, we studied the uptake of different analytes by means of pore&#8208;forming proteins, amphiphilic transmembrane carriers, and direct bilayer permeation.







Abstract
Compartmentalized models with coupled catalytic networks are considered as &#8220;protocells&#8221; in the context of research related to the origin of life. To model the kinetics of a simple cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism process, we use a compartmentalized protocell system that combines liposome&#8208;encapsulated intravesicular reporter pairs with co&#8208;encapsulated enzymes to monitor the membrane transport of a substrate (analyte uptake) and its subsequent enzymatic reaction inside the vesicles (metabolism to the product). The intravesicular chemosensing ensembles consist of the macrocycles cucurbit[7]uril or p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene and matching fluorescent dyes to set up suitable reporter pairs. When these macrocycle/dye reporter pairs are co&#8208;encapsulated with enzymes (trypsin, protein kinase A, or butyrylcholinesterase), it is possible to monitor first the transport of different substrates (polylysine, protamine, H&#8208;LRRWSLG&#8208;OH, or butyrylcholine) through added pores (outer membrane proteins F and C), with synthetic carriers (amphiphilic calixarenes), or by direct permeation (only for butyrylcholine). The subsequent enzymatic conversions of the substrates after they have entered the corresponding protocells can be monitored as consecutive reactions. The new type of in vitro assays can be applied to different enzymes and analytes, affording a comprehensive chemosensing system of high chemical complexity.

The new type of in vitro assays can be applied to different enzymes and analytes, affording a comprehensive chemosensing system of high chemical complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Imines and Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes is reported for the first time. Tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted chiral allylamines were synthesized in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Experimental and computational studies show that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst drives oxidative cyclization. Zinc acts as an electron source and a transmetallating agent for catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Chiral allylamines are important structural components in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes to synthesize chiral allylamines. The reaction is catalyzed by a cobalt complex derived from commercially available bisphosphine ligand utilizing zinc as the electron donor. The substrate scope is extensive. Symmetric and unsymmetric alkyl and aryl alkynes have been successfully coupled with various imines derived from aryl and alkyl aldehydes. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl amines were isolated in high yields, with enantiomeric excess surpassing &gt;99.9&#8201;% and regioselectivities exceeding &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1. These chiral allyl amines can serve as versatile platforms for subsequent transformations while preserving their stereochemical integrity. Extensive experimental and computational mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism. These investigations have indicated that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst enables the oxidative cyclization of alkynes and imines, and a spin crossover occurs during the enantio&#8208;determining step. Zinc plays a pivotal role in facilitating the transmetallation of the resulting azacobaltacycle. The observed enantioselectivity was interpreted by the stabilization of the transition state through higher stabilizing interaction energy from high negative polarization, dispersion, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Modular Photoswitchable Molecular Glues for Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Control of Protein Function in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. This system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
Optogenetic systems using photosensitive proteins and chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) approaches enabled by chemical dimerizers (also termed molecular glues), are powerful tools to elucidate the dynamics of biological systems and to dissect complex biological regulatory networks. Here, we report a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular, photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that can undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally design the sMGs and further expand their scope by incorporating different photoswitches, resulting in sMGs with customizable properties. We demonstrate that this system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision. This system enables sophisticated optical manipulation of cellular processes and thus opens up a new avenue for chemo&#8208;optogenetics.

         <title>Retrieving the Stability and Practical Performance of Activation&#8208;Unstable Mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Calibrating Acidity Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilize and improve! Mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker&#8208;installation both retrieved the activation&#8208;unstable framework of mesoporous NKM&#8208;809 and produced stabilized MOF derivatives. They established enhanced pyridyl&#8208;site density and mass transfer, and capable in self&#8208;calibrating pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. Extra quenching of emission&#8208;noise further distinguished NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, integrating quality&#8208;self&#8208;monitoring for practical usage.







Abstract
The practical applications of activation&#8208;unstable mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often constrained by their structural instability. However, enhancing their stability could unlock valuable functionalities. Herein, we stabilized the otherwise unstable, post&#8208;activated structure of a novel mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF, NKM&#8208;809, which constructed from a pyridine&#8208;containing amphiprotic linker (PPTB). We applied two strategies: mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker installation. In the mixed&#8208;linker approach, we incorporated an auxiliary linker, TPTB, which resembles PPTB, during synthesis to improve the framework's stability. In the linker installation approach, we introduced a ditopic carboxylate linker (BPDC) into the coordination&#8208;unsaturated sites of NKM&#8208;809. These strategies produced stabilized derivatives, named NKM&#8208;808.X (X=&#967;PPTB) and NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, which exhibit pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence at distinct emission wavelengths. Remarkably, these emissions shift oppositely upon protonation and dissociation, distinguishing them as highly sensitive, self&#8208;calibrating acidity sensors. In NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, an additional quenching of the linker&#8208;emission (419&#8197;nm) minimizes inherent interference, enabling integrated quality and lifespan self&#8208;monitoring. Theoretical calculations identified transitions between (n, &#960;*) and (&#960;, &#960;*) emission states during the sensing process and highlighted the role of a stable mesoporous network in achieving stronger protonation response. These findings showcase the potential of stabilized mesoporous MOFs for practical applications, alongside valuable insights into strategies for optimizing such materials.

         <title>Accurate Molecular Sensing based on a Modular and Customizable CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we establish a universal nanopore sensing strategy named CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes of distinctive nanopore signals. The detection thus can be easily customized into various application scenes with all advantages of high accuracy, high resolution, high simplicity and multi&#8208;assay available.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nanopore is a promising single molecular detection technique, but is largely limited by relatively low resolution to small&#8208;size targets and laborious design of signaling probes. Here we establish a universal, CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes via a &#8220;Signal&#8208;ON&#8221; mode. Target recognition activates the cleavage activity of a Cas12a/crRNA system and then completely digest the blocker of an initiator. The unblocked initiator then triggers downstream DNA assembly reaction and generate a large&#8208;size structure easy for nanopore detection. Such integration of Cas12a/crRNA with DNA assembly establishes an accurate correspondence among the input targets, output DNA structures, and the ultimate nanopore signals. We demonstrated dsDNA, long RNA (i.e., Flu virus gene), short microRNA (i.e., let&#8208;7d) and non&#8208;nucleic acids (i.e., Pb2+) as input paradigms. Various structural assembly reactions, such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR), G&#8208;HCR and duplex polymerization strategy (DPS), are adapted as outputs for nanopore signaling. Simultaneous assay is also verified via transferring FluA and FluB genes into HCR and G&#8208;HCR, respectively. CANON is thus a modular sensing platform holding multiple advantages such as high accuracy, high resolution and high universality, which can be easily customized into various application scenes.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;mediated Assembly of New Heterocycles: From Borylenes to Oxaboroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;stabilized rhodium borylene, generated by metal&#8208;ligand cooperative dehydrogenation of H2BMes (Mes=mesityl), regioselectively adds a series of alkynes (R=Ph, Me, H, CO2Et) across boron and the carbon atom of a CO ligand.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Framework as a Highly Porous Photosensitizer for Environmental Remediation and Pollutants Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores have been directly implemented into the highly porous covalent organic framework BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF which crystallizes in AA stacking mode with hbc topology. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications ranging from dual&#8208;mode fluorescence sensing to pollutants removal from aqueous solutions and detoxification of a mustard gas simulant via photosensitization.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) subunits into the structural backbone of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gives facile access to porous photosensitizers but is still a challenging task. Here, we introduce &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF, which crystallizes in AA&#8208;stacking mode with hcb topology. A comprehensive characterization reveals high crystallinity and enhanced stability in a variety of solvents, excellent mesoporosity (SABET=1042&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), broad light absorption in the visible region, and red emission upon the exfoliation of few&#8208;layer COF nanosheets. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications. Pollutants Bisphenol A (BPA, qmax=426&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Methylene Blue (MB, qmax=96&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) have been efficiently removed from H2O. Fluorescence quenching or enhancement of exfoliated BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF nanosheets have been utilized for dual&#8208;mode sensing of MB or NEt3, respectively. Ultimately, the photosensitizing effect of the BODIPY units is retained in the COF. Thus, BPD&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF was established as a metal&#8208;free triplet photosensitizer, which efficiently oxidized a mustard gas simulant under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Organonitrogen Compounds via Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated cascade reaction combines the electrochemical synthesis of hydroxylamine and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient pathway. The system alleviates the environmental crisis caused by the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle and reduces the waste of resources in the transport and purification process.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is a key intermediate in the formation of numerous high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds. The traditional synthesis of NH2OH requires the use of precious metals under high temperature conditions, which leads to high cost, high energy consumption, and environmental pollution. The NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction integrates the electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient alternative. This review presents the recent advances on electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds by NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. We present key concepts and the transformation process of different N&#8208;species to NH2OH, discuss suitable substrates and electrocatalysts, and elucidate the reaction mechanisms involved in generating compounds such as amino acids, cyclohexanone oxime, urea, amine, etc.. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in this emerging field to encourage further research effort and the development of NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Preparation of High&#8208;Crystalline Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy is developed to achieve rapid and kilogram&#8208;scale preparation of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. The obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and micropollutant removal efficiency as well as superior solution processability.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has been extensively applied to the preparation of various porous organic polymers because of its simple operation and abundant building blocks. However, due to its poor reversibility and excessive random reactive sites, the synthesis of crystalline organic polymers/frameworks by Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has never been realized so far. Herein, we develop a molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy to achieve rapid preparation (within only 30 minutes) of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. Theoretical calculations and detailed experiments revealed the critical role of carboxyl groups in aromatic benzene monomer during the CTFs crystallization, which can not only effectively cause a suitable activation barrier for the electrophilic attack of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine through their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, but also introduce anchoring effects (molecular confinement effects) to facilitate the ordered polymerization at specific sites in 2D planar direction. Benefiting from the convenient synthetic route and low&#8208;cost raw materials, we could unprecedentedly realize the kilogram&#8208;scale fabrication of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized high&#8208;crystalline CTFs. Moreover, thanks to the hydrophilic and ionizable properties of carboxyl groups, the obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and superior solution processability.

         <title>Mastering the Copolymerization Behavior of Ethyl Cyanoacrylate as Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;metal Battery Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a facile approach to achieve efficient and controllable copolymerization behaviour of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, affording mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolytes for high voltage and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano&#8208;containing polymers) are attractive for a wide range of applications due to their high dielectric constant and outstanding electrochemical stability. However, the polymerization of such monomers is difficult to control with trace of water affording instant reactions, and copolymerization with other monomers without using strong acid is even more challenging. The present study demonstrates a facile approach enabling efficient and controllable copolymerization of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, achieving mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for safe and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The incorporated dual&#8208;lithium salts, i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only facilitate radical polymerization of ECA monomers by suppressing their anionic polymerization, but also promote the formation of high&#8208;ionic conducting GPE. The incorporated methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer accelerates the radical polymerization of ECA (confirmed by DFT calculations), achieving controlled copolymerization of ECA&#8208;based copolymers.

&lt;p&gt;We develop a facile approach to achieve efficient and controllable copolymerization behaviour of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, affording mechanically robust and high ion-conduction gel polymer electrolytes for high voltage and long cycle-life lithium-metal batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymers with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano-containing polymers) are attractive for a wide range of applications due to their high dielectric constant and outstanding electrochemical stability. However, the polymerization of such monomers is difficult to control with trace of water affording instant reactions, and copolymerization with other monomers without using strong acid is even more challenging. The present study demonstrates a facile approach enabling efficient and controllable copolymerization of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, achieving mechanically robust and high ion-conduction gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for safe and long cycle-life lithium-metal batteries (LMBs). The incorporated dual-lithium salts, i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only facilitate radical polymerization of ECA monomers by suppressing their anionic polymerization, but also promote the formation of high-ionic conducting GPE. The incorporated methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer accelerates the radical polymerization of ECA (confirmed by DFT calculations), achieving controlled copolymerization of ECA-based copolymers. The mechanically robust polymer network made by the ECA copolymer enables LMBs with both LFP cathodes and high-voltage LCO cathodes (4.5&#8197;V) operatable at different temperatures with ultra-long cycle life at 1&#8197;C (capacity retention of 81.1&#8201;% and 83.8&#8201;%, respectively, over 1000 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Opening Control Strategy via Nitrate&#8211;Chloride Anion Exchange for Enhanced Hydrogen Isotope Separation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gate&#8208;opening control via anion exchange in JCM&#8208;1 enables enhanced hydrogen isotope separation through precise tuning of pore aperture and diffusion barriers. The dynamic interplay between structural flexibility and adsorption energetics maximizes D2/H2 selectivity, establishing a robust platform for cryogenic gas separation applications.







Abstract
Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes, especially deuterium (D2), is pivotal for advancing industries such as nuclear fusion, semiconductor processing, and metabolic imaging. Current technologies, including cryogenic distillation and Girdler sulfide processes, suffer from significant limitations in selectivity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we introduce a novel approach utilizing an imidazolium&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), JCM&#8208;1, designed to enhance D2/H2 separation through temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;opening controlled by ion exchange. By substituting NO3&#8722; ions in JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) with Cl&#8722; ions to form JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;), we precisely modulate the gate&#8208;opening threshold, achieving a significant enhancement in isotope selectivity. JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) exhibited a D2/H2 selectivity (SD2/H2) of 14.4 at 30&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, while JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;) achieved an exceptional selectivity of 27.7 at 50&#8197;K and 1&#8197;mbar. This heightened performance is attributed to the reduced pore aperture and higher gate&#8208;opening temperature resulting from the Cl&#8722; exchange, which optimizes the selective adsorption of D2. Our findings reveal that JCM&#8208;1 frameworks, with their finely tunable gate&#8208;opening properties, offer a highly efficient and adaptable platform for hydrogen isotope separation. This work not only advances the understanding of ion&#8208;exchanged MOFs but also opens new pathways for targeted applications in isotope separation and other gas separation processes.

         <title>Regularly Arranged Heterogeneous Pores in Gas Separation Membranes Constructed by Cocrystallization of Porous Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating heterogeneous pore membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. The co&#8208;crystal membranes, featuring alternating small pore&#8208;large pore structure, exhibited good H2/CO2 gas separation performance by overcoming the selectivity&#8208;permeability trade&#8208;off.







Abstract
Integrating two or more materials to construct membranes with heterogeneous pore structures is an effective strategy for enhancing separation performance. Regularly arranging these heterogeneous pores can significantly optimize the combined effect of the introduced components. Porous Organic Cages (POCs), an emerging subclass of porous materials composed of discrete molecules, assemble to form interconnected pores and exhibit permanent porosity in the solid state. A unique feature of POCs is their modularity, enabling a &#8220;mix and match&#8221; approach to create co&#8208;crystal structures driven by the intermolecular interactions. Herein, we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating gas separation membranes. We prepared membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. By optimizing the cocrystalization conditions, we successfully fabricated continuous, defect&#8208;free gas membranes, benefiting from chiral recognition interactions. By introducing regularly alternating small and large pores, we addressed challenges such as the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity in gas separation membrane. Moreover, the cocrystallization strategy has been proven effective for other molecular systems besides POCs, such as macrocycles, for the preparation of co&#8208;crystal membranes. This method broadens the scope for fabricating high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes with ordered heterogeneous pores.

         <title>A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Radical Emission System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems have been built by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. The ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer and ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer effects between metal compounds and organic radicals endow these systems&#8217; multi&#8208;band and multiple stimulus&#8208;response emissions. In addition, such materials have been used to detect radioactive metal ions.







Abstract
Developing new organic radical emission systems and regulating their luminescence properties presents a significant challenge. Herein, we build dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. After the assembling, dual&#8208;band, and excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission was observed upon ultraviolet light irradiation, one emission band originates from carbonyl radical after light irradiation, the other band from the ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which benefits from the charge transfer from the radicals to the metal salts. The dual emission centers also introduce excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties for the molecules. In addition, three&#8208;band emission covering the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions can be shown when two or three kinds of metal ions are simultaneously doped into the radical system driven by the ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT). Interestingly, visible light can quickly quench the radical emission of systems, thus realizing a dynamic luminescence. The LMMCT effect and strong supramolecular interactions significantly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by up to 67.2&#8201;%. Moreover, such materials can be successfully used for detecting radioactive metal ions and information encryption. This study develops a platform for manufacturing various metal&#8208;organic radical emission systems with diverse properties.

         <title>Phosphorescent Liquid Crystalline Polymer&#8208;based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides for Enhanced Photonic Signal Processing and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized phosphorescent optical waveguides with high efficiency have been designed and synthesized using liquid crystalline polymers. These waveguides exhibit low optical loss and emit circularly polarized phosphorescence, making them promising candidates for applications in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching.







Abstract
Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguides have significant potential for advancing photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, the development of CPL optical waveguides materials (OWMs) with low optical loss coefficient remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this, we design and synthesize CPL OWMs based on room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). Experimental results demonstrate that these LCPs exhibit a nematic liquid crystal phase and a phosphorescence lifetime of approximately 0.145&#8197;ms. By introducing a chiral dopant, we induce a chiral arrangement in the LCPs, followed by crosslinking via photo&#8208;cycloaddition and removal of the chiral dopants through solvent soaking. The resulting polymers exhibit stable solvent resistance and highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) properties, with dissymmetric factors (gRTP) in the range of 0.16 to 0.17. Notably, the CPP&#8208;active OWMs exhibit efficient circularly polarized photonic signal waveguiding, with an optical loss coefficient of approximately 0.175 dB/mm. Ultimately, these CPP&#8208;active OWMs are sucessfully applied in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching, paving the way for advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Accessing Azetidines through Magnesium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Group Transfer from Iminoiodinane to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a magnesium&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. This protocol operates under mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and showcases excellent chemoselectivity, along with broad functional group tolerance. We report for the first time that challenging alkyl donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes can undergo ring expansion leading to aliphatic azetidines without relying on external oxidants or precious transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium (Mg)&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.

         <title>Exploiting Lattice Carbon&#8208;Induced Modulation Effect in Nickel towards Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the content of lattice carbon (LC), the electronic structure and adsorption properties of nickel are changed, and the volcanic relationship between the lattice carbon content and the alkaline HOR activity is revealed.







Abstract
Doping with non&#8208;metallic heteroatom is an effective approach to tailor the electronic structure of Ni for enhancing its alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalytic performance. However, the modulation of HOR activity of Ni by lattice carbon (LC) atoms has rarely been reported, especially to reveal the rule between the doping effect and activity caused by the content of LC atoms. Here, hydrogen is proposed as a scavenger for LC atoms in the pyrolytic reduction process to finely control the content of LC atoms in Ni. With the removal of LC atoms in Ni lattice, the electronic structure changes from Ni3C&#8208;like electronic structure to quasi&#8208;Ni structure. Furthermore, a volcanic relationship between the LC content and HOR activity of Ni is established for the first time. The Cless&#8208;Ni (LC0.44&#8208;Ni) with optimized LC content shows the best activity owing to the weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and optimal hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE). This work provides an inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts by tailoring the electronic structure of the metal via LC atoms doping.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Symmetry Copper Benzenehexathiol Coordination Polymer with In&#8208;Plane Electrical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrically conductive coordination polymer, Cu5BHT, featuring a low&#8208;symmetry structure, is synthesized on the water surface. We demonstrate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal directions.







Abstract
Electrically conductive coordination polymers (ECCPs), particularly those incorporating benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligands, are emerging as a distinctive class of electronic materials with tunable semiconducting and metallic properties. However, the exploration of novel ECCPs with low&#8208;symmetry structures and electrical anisotropy remains under development. Here, we report the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of a novel ECCP, namely Cu5BHT, which exhibits a low&#8208;symmetry structure and unique in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy that differs from the well&#8208;known Cu3BHT phase. Utilizing imaging and diffraction techniques, we elucidate the unit cell and crystal structure of Cu5BHT, revealing an asymmetric arrangement of the kagome resembling lattice connected by two different secondary building units: square planar CuS4 and non&#8208;planar Cu2S4. Theoretical studies indicate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal direction. Single&#8208;crystal electrical measurements confirm a metallic character characterized by the increase of conductance upon cooling. Notably, the measured conductance along different crystal directions within the ab plane unambiguously reveals a significant anisotropy, with an anisotropic factor reaching ~8. This work demonstrates a novel low&#8208;symmetry ECCP and highlights its potential for achieving in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy.

         <title>Design of an Ultrafast and Controlled Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter RAFT Polymerization for Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel xanthate molecule was designed to facilitate highly controlled photoiniferter RAFT polymerization at fast rates under visible light. This approach was applied in aqueous photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (photo&#8208;PISA). The rapid photolysis and extended absorption of this xanthate enable ultrafast and scalable fabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with various well&#8208;defined morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.







Abstract
In this contribution, we designed a new xanthate RAFT agent by introducing (5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxy (TNO) as the Z group, namely 2&#8208;[(((5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxycarbonothioyl)thio)ethyl propanoate] (TNXEP). Due to the presence of the TNO group, TNXEP enabled highly controlled and ultrafast photoiniferter RAFT polymerization under violet (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) and blue (&#955;=450&#8197;nm) light. This approach was effectively extended to aqueous media for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), facilitating the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles. Leveraging the rapid photolysis and extended absorption of TNXEP, we demonstrated the first photoiniferter PISA system realizing ultrafast polymerization (&gt;90&#8201;% monomer conversion in minutes) under visible light irradiation. Enhanced visible light penetration improved photopolymerization uniformity, enabling rapid and scalable production of polymeric nanoparticles at a 30&#8197;g scale in just 10 minutes, with tunable morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.

         <title>Comprehensive Passivation of Surface and Bulk Defects in Perovskite for High Efficiency Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive strategy combining &#8220;wet film treatment&#8221; and &#8220;dry film treatment&#8221; was proposed to passivate surface and bulk defects of CsPbI3 films. The high diffusivity of choline in the intermediate phase film made the LD perovskite permeate through the grain boundaries of the bulk film. Benefiting from this strategy, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have the advantages of high stability and low cost, but their mean efficiency has become an obstacle to commercialization. Defects, which are widely distributed on the surface and bulk of films, are an important factor in C&#8208;PSCs for low efficiency. The conventional post&#8208;treatment method through forming a low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskite layer usually fails in manipulating the bulk defects. Herein, we propose a strategy of combining wet film (uncrystallized) treatment with dry film treatment to in situ form LD perovskite throughout the grain boundaries inside of the film and on the surface of the film, thereby simultaneously passivating the bulk and surface defects in the CsPbI3 film. As a result, the photoluminescence lifetime is significantly improved from 22.5&#8197;ns to 92.1&#8197;ns. The assembled CsPbI3 C&#8208;PSCs based on the above strategy deliver a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Anion Transport by Bambusuril&#8208;Bile Acid Conjugates: Drastic Effect of the Cholesterol Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bambusuril macrocycles were functionalized with bile acids of different polarities and studied as anion transporters. The bambusuril with the most polar bile acids was demonstrated to form a unimolecular anion channel. Furthermore, increasing the cholesterol content in the membrane of liposomes drastically decreased the ion transport activity, likely squeezing the bile acid arms together to close the channel.







Abstract
Artificial anion transporters offer a potential way to treat deficiencies in cellular anion transport of genetic origins. In contrast to the large variety of mobile anion carriers and self&#8208;assembled anion channels reported, unimolecular anion channels are less investigated. Herein, we present a unique example of a unimolecular anion channel based on a bambusuril (BU) macrocycle, a well&#8208;established anion receptor. The BU structure was expanded by appending various bile acid residues allowing a single molecule to span the membrane. Chloride transport mediated by BUs through lipid bilayers was investigated in liposomes and these studies revealed a surprisingly high dependence of the anion transport activity on the cholesterol content in the liposomal membrane.

         <title>Highly Tension&#8208;Strained Copper Concentrates Diluted Cations for Selective Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly tension&#8208;strained copper creates an electron&#8208;rich surface that concentrates diluted cations, which enables highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion under pH&#8197;1 electrolyte with 1&#8197;M potassium ions, showing 44.3&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward C2H4 over 100&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 3.1 volts in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyser.







Abstract
Electrolysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) in acid offers a promising route to overcome CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, but requires concentrated alkali cations (typical &#8805;3&#8197;M) to mitigate the trade&#8208;off between low pH and high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate, causing salt precipitation. Here we report a strategy to resolve this problem by introducing tensile strain in a copper (Cu) catalyst, which can selectively reduce CO2 to valuable multicarbon products, particularly ethylene, in a pH&#8197;1 electrolyte with 1&#8197;M potassium ions. We find that the tension&#8208;strained Cu creates an electron&#8208;rich surface that concentrates diluted potassium ions, contributing to CO2 activation and HER suppression. With this catalyst, we show constant ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 44.3&#8201;% over 100&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 3.1 volts in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyser. Moreover, selective electrosynthesis of ethylene oxide using the as&#8208;produced ethylene was demonstrated in an integrated system.

         <title>Tailoring Water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;stable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO electrolyte was proposed to achieve stable Zn anodes and cathodes. The Zn2+ solvation structure composed of DMSO and BF4&#8722; leads to the formation of the Zn2+&#8208;conducting SEIs and superior stability of Zn anode. Simultaneously, the water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO solvent environment reduces deleterious proton insertion, enhancing the stability of VO2 cathode.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc batteries (RZBs) are hindered by two primary challenges: instability of Zn anode and deterioration of the cathode structure in traditional aqueous electrolytes, largely attributable to the decomposition of active H2O. Here, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;flammable water&#8208;in&#8208;dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte to address these issues. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ techniques and computational simulations demonstrate that the activity of H2O in this electrolyte is extremely compressed, which not only suppresses the side reactions and increases the reversibility of Zn anode, but also diminishes the cathode dissolution and proton intercalation. The hybrid solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), formed in situ, helps Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cell a prolonged lifespan exceeding 10000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 600&#8197;h at a 60&#8201;% discharge depth. The versatility of this electrolyte endows the Zn&#8208;VO2 full batteries ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance. This work provides insights into electrolyte structure&#8211;property relationships, and facilitates the design of high&#8208;performance RZBs.

         <title>Unlocking CO2 Activation With a Novel Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of the divalent precursor (&#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P'&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3)NiBr has given the diamagnetic trinuclear complex [Ni2Hg] featuring two (formally) monovalent Ni centers bonded to a bridging mercury atom. The thermally stable but fairly labile Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni core in [Ni2Hg] facilitates a smooth disproportionation of CO2, according to the net equation &#8220;2&#8197;CO2+2&#8197;e&#8722;&#8594;CO32&#8722;+CO&#8221;. This process begins with an initial CO2 insertion that expels Hg to give the intermediate [Ni2CO2], whereas the latter can promote a second CO2 insertion followed by CO gas release to give [Ni2CO3]. This &#956;&#8208;carbonate species can be reduced with Na/Hg to regenerate the original complex [Ni2Hg].







Abstract
Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni core (POCOP=&#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P'&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate&#8208;bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its &#956;&#8208;CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32&#8722; and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter's decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a &#956;&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;carbonate rather than a &#956;&#8208;oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of [Ni2CO3] with excess Na/Hg regenerates [Ni2Hg], establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO2 in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.

Bubbling CO gas through a solution of &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt; gave its &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&#956;&lt;/span&gt;-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; analogue &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;, which itself reacts with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give back &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;, indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hg]&lt;/b&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion to give &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;, followed by another CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion to give the second intermediate &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;, and the latter's decarbonylation to give &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&#956;&lt;/span&gt;-carbonyl-carbonate rather than a &lt;span style="color:#333333"&gt;&#956;&lt;/span&gt;-oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/b&gt; with excess Na/Hg regenerates &lt;b&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hg]&lt;/b&gt;, establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Amorphous 2D Polymer Nanodiscs with Tuneable Size, pH&#8208;Responsive Degradation and Controlled Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tadpole&#8208;like amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with pH&#8208;responsive side chains are synthesized to prepare self&#8208;assembled nanodiscs, with sizes from 200&#8197;nm to over 1&#8197;&#956;m controlled by sidechain compositions. These nanodiscs enter cancer cells, degrade in acidic conditions, with different hydrolysis kinetics, enabling targeted drug release, demonstrating significant potential for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with tadpole&#8208;like, coil&#8208;rod architecture can be used to self&#8208;assemble into functional polymer nanodiscs directly in water. The hydrophobic segments of the BBC were tuned via the ratio of ethoxy&#8208;ethyl glycidyl ether (EE) to tetrahydropyranyl glycidyl ether (TP) within the grafted polymer sidechains. In turn, this variation controlled the sizes, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and drug loading capacity of the self&#8208;assembled nanodiscs. Notably, as EE exhibited faster hydrolysis than TP, the nanodiscs featured variable degradation rates under mild acidic conditions, aiding small molecule release and time&#8208;dependent and complete degradation of discs into fully water&#8208;soluble copolymers. The nanodiscs demonstrated biocompatibility and cellular uptake by breast cancer cells, underscoring their potential development into drug delivery systems.

         <title>Conformationally Restricted Macrocycles as Improved FKBP51 Inhibitors Enabled by Systematic Linker Derivatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic linkerology: Linking two positions is the key step of macrocyclization, i.e. the transformation of &#8216;linear&#8217; protein ligands to macrocycles. Here we show that longer linkers can be remarkable flexible, with the same backbone giving rise to multiple series with distinct conformations and binding modes. Derivatization of these linkers is highly efficient to control conformations and to improve multiple drug&#8208;like properties in macrocycles.







Abstract
Macrocycles are increasingly considered as promising modalities to target challenging intracellular proteins. However, strategies for transitioning from active linear starting points to improved macrocycles are still underdeveloped. Here we explored the derivatization of linkers as an approach for macrocycle optimization. Using the FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) as a model system we prepared &gt;140 macrocycles with systematically derivatized linkers. Two backbones were identified as promising frameworks for subsequent optimization. Surprisingly, co&#8208;crystal structure analyses revealed that these chemical templates represent an ensemble of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) conformations that can give rise to several distinct 3D&#8208;scaffolds. This resulted in a set of macrocycles with consistently improved affinity, plasma stability, and aqueous solubility compared to the linear precursors or the non&#8208;functionalized macrocycles. Our results highlight linkers as an opportunity for macrocyclic drug development, show how linker derivatization can improve the performance of macrocycles, and emphasizes the need to track macrocyclic scaffold evolution at a three&#8208;dimensional level.

         <title>Discrete Hybrid Vanadium&#8208;oxo Cluster as a Targeted Tool for Selective Protein Oxidative Modifications and Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid vanadium&#8208;oxo cluster selectively binds to hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and facilitates localized oxidation in the vicinity of its binding site. These modifications occur under physiological conditions through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. This innovative approach highlights the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters for precise, targeted protein modification.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modification on protein structure and functions is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to combat macromolecular damage and cell death. However, selectively inducing oxidative modifications in proteins under physiological conditions remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate that [V6O13{(OCH2)3CCH2OH}2]2&#8722; (V6&#8208;OH) hybrid metal&#8208;oxo cluster can be used for selective protein oxidative cleavage and modifications. We present the first example of a protein&#8208;bound hybrid vanadate cluster, where its interactions with protein surfaces and the redox activity of vanadium enable selective oxidative modifications. Single Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) of the V6&#8208;OH and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) complex revealed that the binding is dictated both by the inorganic core and the organic ligands attached to it. Selective oxidation or cleavage of HEWL occurs under physiological conditions by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. The outcome of the oxidative reaction can be tuned by varying the concentration of V6&#8208;OH to result either in selective oxidation of the amino acid side chains or peptide bond cleavage. LC&#8211;MS and crystallography revealed that oxidative modifications were mainly concentrated near the cluster binding sites, providing spatial control of ROS production. This study advances our understanding of vanadium's role in biological systems and demonstrates the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters in protein modification.

         <title>Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual circularity concept was demonstrated to prevent plastic waste accumulation, where rational design paved the way. Apart from fully recovery of mechanical and thermal properties after as many as six repeated mechanical recycling cycles, the polyesters could be closed&#8208;loop chemical recycled via facile, time and energy efficient manners. In case of polymers with dual circularity, it is recommended to proceed with mechanical recycling when we can, switch to chemical recycling when we must.







Abstract
The plastic waste accumulation requires facile yet effective solutions. Currently mechanical recycling typically leads to downcycling, while the environmental footprint of chemical recycling is often unacceptable. Here, we introduce a dual circularity concept, where rational molecular design paves the way for complementary closed&#8208;loop mechanical and chemical recyclability under mild conditions. Very small changes in macromolecular structures, thermal and mechanical properties were observed, after as many as six repeated mechanical recycling cycles, showing that a wide processing window could be the key for closing the mechanical recycling loop. Facile, time and energy efficient closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling into products with identical performance to original ones was also realized, thanks to the abundant free volume and accessible ester&#8208;functionalities. With these design criteria at hand, dual circulation in recyclability can be realized; proceeding with mechanical recycling when we can, and switching to chemical recycling when we must.

Upon accumulation in the mitochondria of tumor cells, CNF induces superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thereby activating the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway to trigger pyroptosis. This therapeutic approach effectively modulates the tumor immune microenvironment and enhances cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Camptothecin (CPT), a chemotherapeutic agent, demonstrates significant potential in cancer therapy. However, as a drug, CPT molecule suffers from poor water solubility, limited bioavailability, and insufficient immune response. Herein, we construct CPT nanofibers (CNF) with a right&#8208;handed chiral property via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which significantly overcomes the solubility barriers associated with bioavailability and improves tumor immune prognosis. The CNF exhibits high chiral asymmetry factor (gabs) (~0.11) and remarkable structure stability under pH&#8197;6.5 condition. By formulating chiral CNF with mitochondrial&#8208;targeted DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;TPP, CNF accumulates specifically in the mitochondria of cancer cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and a 3.42&#8208;fold increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to the CPT molecule. This ROS amplification activates the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway, inducing pyroptosis that promotes M1 macrophage polarization and enhances CD8+ T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity. Consequently, CNF achieves 1.8&#8208;fold greater growth inhibition of distant tumor and reduces tumor metastasis compared to the CPT molecule. Our innovative platform, assembling CPT molecules into chiral CNF structure, is highly anticipated to overcome the current clinical limitations of CPT molecules and offer a new direction for the development of next&#8208;generation immunotherapy strategies.

         <title>Unveiling the Photoluminescence Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Evolution and Synergistic Photoluminescence of Multiple Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular fluorophore named 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,8,13,14&#8208;tetrahaydroimidazo[2,3&#8208;k][4,7,11]&#8208;triazaacephenanthrylene&#8208;1,5,10(12H)&#8208;trione (IATO) was separated from the carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) prepared with citric acid and ethylenediamine. IATO had been proven to evolve from 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;7&#8208;carboxylic acid (IPCA). Further research revealed the whole photoluminescence mechanism of CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic photoluminescence of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle.







Abstract
Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are a class of exceptional fluorescent materials with diverse applications. However, their photoluminescence (PL) mechanism remained enigmatic and controversial, hindering further development and application. While molecular fluorophores explain primary fluorescence in some CPDs, the overall PL of CPDs still cannot be fully explained, such as their excitation&#8208;dependent behaviors, let alone the modulation of PL. Besides, the extracted molecular fluorophores are dissociative, raising questions including the purity of CPDs and whether the PL of CPDs nanoparticles come from these molecular fluorophores. Here, the emission around 510&#8197;nm of citric acid&#8208;ethylenediamine CPDs (CA&#8208;EDA CPDs) was proved to be contributed by a molecular fluorophore, which evolved from another molecular fluorophore following the quantum confinement effect. Further research revealed the whole PL mechanism of CA&#8208;EDA CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic PL of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle. The evolution of molecular fluorophores had also been observed in another two systems, indicating the universality of this mechanism, and a new approach for regulating the optical properties of CPDs was put forward inspired by this mechanism. This study not only refined the PL mechanism but also paved the way for future advancements of CPDs.

         <title>Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Carbon Monoxide and Nitric Oxide Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational coupling of aerobic photooxidative and anaerobic photocatalytic reactions within a micelle platform enables spatiotemporally controlled, simultaneous release of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) under clinically relevant wavelengths. This intracellular co&#8208;delivery of CO and NO synergistically induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell apoptosis, offering significant potential for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Understanding the interplay between gasotransmitters is essential for unlocking their therapeutic potential. However, achieving spatiotemporally controlled co&#8208;delivery to target cells remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy for the intracellular co&#8208;delivery of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitters under clinically relevant wavelengths. This approach rationally couples aerobic photooxidative and anaerobic photocatalytic reactions within a polymeric micelle platform, using palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) as both photosensitizer and photocatalyst. Notably, the photooxidation&#8208;mediated release of CO generates a local hypoxic microenvironment, which facilitates the photoredox catalyzed release of NO. This self&#8208;adaptive micelle platform enables efficient uptake by tumor cells and intracellular co&#8208;delivery of CO and NO under 630&#8197;nm light irradiation, demonstrating potent anti&#8208;tumor activity in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model via the synergistic induction of mitochondrial apoptosis.

         <title>Iridium(III) Blue Phosphors with Heteroleptic Carbene Cyclometalates: Isomerization, Emission Tuning, and OLED Fabrications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ir(III) complexes are particularly noted for their excellent photophysical properties in giving blue OLED phosphors. In this study, two distinctive carbene pro&#8208;chelates LAH2+ and LBH2+ (or LCH2+) were employed in preparation of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes, to which LAH2+ bears a cyano substituted benzoimidazolium along with N&#8208;mesityl appendage, while LBH2+ (or LCH2+) carries the symmetrical benzoimidazolium entity. Notably, the reversible equilibration at high temperature was observed for m, f&#8208;ct14 and m, f&#8208;ct15 with a single LA chelate. In contrast, only the mer&#8208;substituted m&#8208;ct16 was obtained upon employing two LA chelates. All Ir(III) complexes exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#934;PL &#8805; 78%) with short radiative lifetimes (&#964;rad &#8804; 1.05 &#181;s) in solution. The Ph OLED device with m&#8208;ct16 afforded an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% at 5000 cd m&#8210;2. Moreover, the hyper&#8208;OLED based on m&#8208;ct16 and v&#8208;DABNA exhibited EQE1000 of 32.1% (EQE recorded at 1000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2) and J90 of 15.0 mA cm&#8210;2 (current density at 90% of max. EQE). Its suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE of 32.1% and 27.7% at 1000 cd&#183;m&#8210;2 and 10000 cd&#183;m&#8210;2) demonstrated a milestone in fabrication of blue OLED devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Tuned Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Synergistic Covalent Adaptable Networks: Towards Recycled Elastomers with Excellent Creep&#8208;Resistant Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer innovative solutions for the reprocessing and recycling of thermoset polymers. However, achieving a balance between easy reprocessing and creep resistance remains a challenge. This study focuses on designing and synthesizing polyurethane (PU) materials with tailored properties by manipulating the stereochemistry of diamine chain extenders. By employing cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;configurations of diamine extenders, we developed a series of PU materials with varying mechanical properties and creep resistance. The trans&#8208;configured materials (R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU or S,S&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited superior creep resistance and mechanical strength due to dense hydrogen bonding networks. The cis&#8208;configured materials (Cis&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited enhanced processability and elasticity. Under 0.1 MPa stress, R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU showed a mere 3.5% strain change at 170 &#176;C over 60 minutes, highlighting its superior creep resistance. Both configurations can be recycled via urea bond exchange reactions using hot pressing or solvothermal methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the (R,R&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)&#8322; and (S,S&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)&#8322; segments form six hydrogen bonds with shorter bond lengths, leading to stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Conversely, the (Cis&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)&#8322; segment forms four hydrogen bonds with longer bond lengths, resulting in weaker interactions. This work highlights the critical role of stereochemistry in designing high&#8208;performance, recyclable polymer materials with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Unprecedent Layered Perovskite&#8208;type Heterostructure Ferroelectric via Chemical Molecular Scissor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise stacking of distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rigid slabs to build heterostructures has renewed the portfolio of 2D materials, e.g., magic&#8208;angle graphene, due to the emergence of exotic physical properties. Recently, single&#8208;crystal heterostructures of layered perovskites have emerged as an exciting branch, while it remains scarce to achieve strong ferroelectricity in this new heterostructure family. Here, we present the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal, (EA3Pb2Br7)EA4Pb3Br10 (1, EA = ethylamine), by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. It has notable ferroelectricity of large spontaneous polarization (Ps ~ 5.0 &#956;C/cm&#178;) and high Curie temperature (Tc ~ 375 K). Structurally, its inorganic framework adopts a unique 2D heterostructure that contains two different rigid slabs of {EA3Pb2Br7}n and {EA4Pb3Br10}n. This motif is self&#8208;assembled by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer clipping of rigid prototype sheets, using extra neopentylamine as a molecular chemical scissor. Unlike epitaxial growth, such a molecule&#8208;level stacking facilitates the growth of heterostructure single crystals. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device of 1 exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode, being the highest level of 2D perovskite ferroelectric family. Our work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Layered Germanium Iodide Perovskite Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of ferroelectricity in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors has opened a new and exciting chapter in next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics due to their lattice&#8208;dimensionality&#8208;induced unique behaviors and fascinating functionalities brought by spontaneous polarization. The emerging layered halide perovskites with 2D lattices provide a great platform for generating reduced symmetry and low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectricity. Herein, inspired by the approach of reduced lattice dimensionality, a series of 2D layered germanium iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors A2CsGe2I7 [where A = PA (propylammonium), BA (butylammonium) and AA (amylammonium)] was firstly developed, which demonstrates remarkable semiconducting features including narrow direct bandgap (~1.8 eV) and high conductivity over 32.23 nS/cm. Emphatically, these layered germanium iodide perovskites manifest large in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization over ~10.0 &#956;C/cm2, mainly attributed to the large off&#8208;centering ion displacement induced by stereo&#8208;active lone&#8208;pairs of Ge2+ . More specifically, in contrast to three&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric CsGeI3, the representative 2D layered BA2CsGe2I7 manifests a superior polarization&#8208;sensitive bulk photovoltaic effect with a polarization ratio of 1.68 and high short circuit current density up to 81.25 &#956;A/cm2, superior to those of reported layered halide perovskite ferroelectrics. This work provides an exciting pathway for the development of 2D ferroelectric semiconductorsand sheds light on their further applications in photoelectronic fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Hydrogen Bonding between Ligand and Substrate Accelerates C&#8211;H Bond Activation and Enables Switchable Site Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed selective and efficient activation of an inert C&#8211;H bond in an organic substrate is of importance for the development of streamlined synthetic methodologies. An attractive approach is the design of a metal catalyst capable of recognizing an organic substrate through noncovalent interactions to control reactivity and selectivity. We report here a spirobipyridine ligand that bears a hydroxy group that recognizes pyridine and quinoline substrates through hydrogen bonding, and in combination with an iridium catalyst enables site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H borylation. The site selectivity can be switched by simply changing the position of the hydroxy group on the ligand. The catalyst also accelerates the reactions, overrides steric bias, and selectively recognizes a pyridine substrate in the presence of other hydrogen bond acceptors. These features are reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis and suggest that judicious design of the recognition group on the ligand can become a general strategy to selectively and efficiently functionalize organic substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable and Precise Synthesis of Structurally Colored Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: Enabling Refined Color Calibration for Sustainable Photonic Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer a vibrant, eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional toxic pigments and dyes, providing vivid structural colors with significantly reduced environmental impact. Scaling up the synthesis of these polymers for practical applications has been challenging with conventional batch methods, which suffer from slow mass and heat transfer, inadequate mixing, and issues with reproducibility. Precise control over molecular weight and dispersity remains a significant challenge for achieving finely tuned color appearances. Here, we present an alternative strategy to overcome the challenges by integrating a rapid continuous flow technique with an in&#8208;line self&#8208;assembly procedure. This strategy enables the rapid, stable and large&#8208;scale synthesis of narrow&#8208;dispersed BBCPs, exceeding 2 kg/day, a significant improvement over conventional gram&#8208;scale methods. Furthermore, precise control over the degree of polymerization is achieved with an unprecedented interval accuracy of four repeat units. This level of precision enables refined color calibration in the resulting photonic pigments, effectively eliminating the need for labor&#8208;intensive and costly multiple batch syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Switching of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation for Orchestrating Enzyme Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and associated assembly and disassembly of biomolecular condensates play crucial roles in cellular organization and metabolic networks. These processes are often regulated by supramolecular interactions. However, the complex and disordered structures of IDPs, coupled with their rapid conformational fluctuations, pose significant challenges for reconstructing supramolecularly&#8208;regulated dynamic LLPS systems and quantitatively illustrating variations in molecular interactions. Inspired by the structural feature of IDPs that facilitates LLPS, we designed a simplified phase&#8208;separating molecule, Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap, consisting of two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative. This compound exhibits LLPS under physiological conditions, forming coacervate microdroplets that undergo multiple cycles of disassembly and reassembly upon stoichiometric addition of Cucurbit[7]uril and Adamantane, respectively, based upon competitive host&#8208;guest interactions. Importantly, such reversible control offers a unique route to quantify entropically dominant nature (&#916;S= 14.0 cal&#8729;mol&#8208;1&#8729;K&#8208;1) within the LLPS process, in which the binding affinity of host&#8208;guest interactions (&#916;G= &#8722;14.9 kcal&#8729;mol&#8208;1) surpass that of the LLPS of Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap (&#916;G= &#8722;2.1 kcal&#8729;mol&#8208;1), enabling the supramolecular regulation process. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, provides a promising platform for either boosting or retarding enzymatic reactions, thereby orchestrating biological enzyme kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Tolerance and Phase Selection in the Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation and Electrocatalytic OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metal&#8208;organic frameworks are coordination&#8208;driven assemblies, the structural prediction and design using metal&#8208;ligand interactions can be unreliable due to other competing interactions. Leveraging non&#8208;coordination interactions to develop porous assemblies could enable new materials and applications. Here, we use a multi&#8208;module MOF system to explore important and pervasive impact of ligand&#8208;ligand interactions on metal&#8208;ligand as well as ligand&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly process. It is found that ligand&#8208;ligand interactions play critical roles on the scope or breakdown of isoreticular chemistry. With cooperative di&#8208; and tri&#8208;topic ligands, a family of Ni&#8208;MOFs has been synthesized in various structure types including partitioned MIL&#8208;88&#8208;acs (pacs), interrupted pacs (i&#8208;pacs), and UMCM&#8208;1&#8208;muo. A new type of isoreticular chemistry on the muo platform is established between two drastically different chemical systems. The gas sorption and electrocatalytic studies were performed that reveal excellent performance such as high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 21.8 and high C2H2 uptake capacity of 114.5 cm3/g at 298 K and 1 bar.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Crystal&#8208;Engineered Polydimethylsiloxane: Enhancing Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity through High Grafting Density of Mesogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing power and integration of electronic devices have intensified serious heat accumulation, driving the demand for higher intrinsic thermal conductivity in thermal interface materials, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Grafting mesogens onto PDMS can enhance its intrinsic thermal conductivity. However, the high stability of the PDMS chain limits the grafting density of mesogens, restricting the improvement in thermal conductivity. This work proposes a new strategy to efficiently introduce mesogens onto PDMS through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of liquid crystal cyclosiloxane and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, enhancing the grafting density. The relationship between the grafting density and intrinsic thermal conductivity of liquid crystal polydimethylsiloxane (LC&#8208;PDMS) is investigated by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. Based on the simulation results, LC&#8208;PDMS with enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity is synthesized. When the grafting density of mesogens reaches 77.4%, its intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) increases to 0.56 W/(m&#183;K), showing a 180.0% improvement over ordinary PDMS (0.20 W/(m&#183;K)). The LC&#8208;PDMS also exhibits the low dielectric constant (&#949;, 2.69), low dielectric loss tangent (tan&#948;, 0.0027), high insulation performance (volume resistivity, 3.51&#215;1013 &#937;&#183;cm), excellent thermal stability (heat resistance index, 217.8&#8451;) and excellent hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 137.4&#176;), fulfilling the comprehensive requirements of advanced thermal interface materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced G&#8208;quartets: Robust Supramolecular Polymers Exhibiting Heating&#8208;Induced Aqueous Phase Transitions into Gel or Precipitate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Certain proteins and synthetic covalent polymers experience aqueous phase transitions, driving functional self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we unveil the ability of supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by G4.Cu+ to undergo heating&#8208;induced unexpected aqueous phase transitions. For the first time, guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) formed a highly stable G&#8208;quartet (G4.Cu+)/G&#8208;quadruplex as a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure with temperature tolerance, distinct from the well&#8208;known G4.K+. The G4.Cu+ self&#8208;assembled in water through p&#8208;p stacking, metallophilic and hydrophobic interactions, forming thermally robust SPs. This enhanced stability is attributed to the stronger coordination of Cu+ to four carbonyl oxygens of G&#8208;quartet and the presence of Cu+&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Cu+ attractive metallophilic interactions in Cu+&#8208;induced G&#8208;quadruplex, exhibiting a significantly higher interaction energy than K+ as determined computationally. Remarkably, the aqueous SP solution exhibited heating&#8208;induced phase transitions&#8212;forming a hydrogel through dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking of SPs below cloud temperature (Tcp) and a hydrophobic collapse&#8208;induced solid precipitate above Tcp, showcasing a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. Notably, this LCST behavior of G4.Cu+ SP originates from biomolecular functionality rather than commonly exploited thermo&#8208;responsive oligoethylene glycols with supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, exploiting the redox reversibility of Cu+/Cu2+, we demonstrated control over the assembly and disassembly of G&#8208;quartets/G&#8208;quadruplex and gelation reversibly.</dc:description>

         <title>Carving Metal&#8722;Organic&#8722;Framework Glass Based Solid&#8722;State Electrolyte Via a Top&#8722;Down Strategy for Lithium&#8722;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) suffer from low Li conductivity, poor kinetics and safety concerns. Here, we present a novel porous MOF glass gelled polymer electrolyte (PMG&#8208;GPE) prepared via a top&#8208;down strategy, which features a unique three&#8208;dimensional interconnected graded&#8208;aperture structure for efficient ion transport. Comprehensive analyses, including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS), Solid&#8208;state 7Li magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS&#8208;NMR), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and electrochemical tests, quantify the pore structures, revealing their relationship with ion conductivity that increases and then decreases as macropore proportion rises. The introduced dispersed macropores (17% fraction) can serve as bridges, connecting adjacent transport units to accelerate ion transport. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths&#160;constructed by hierarchical pore structure, the PMG&#8208;GPE achieves a high ionic conductivity of 1.9 mS cm&#8722;1. Additionally, the robust mechanical properties of PMG&#8208;GPE effectively suppress dendrite growth and penetration, outperforming crystal MOF&#8208;based electrolytes. The prepared Li symmetric batteries with PMG&#8208;GPE demonstrate a high critical current density of 5.1 mA cm&#8208;2 (two times higher than crystal MOF&#8208;electrolytes) and stable cycling for over 6000 hours without short circuits. Furthermore, a Li/PMG&#8208;GPE/LFP half&#8208;cell exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 83.12% after 1400 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Releasing Polymer Tubesomes: Boosting Gas Delivery of Nanovehicles via Membrane Stretching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;spherical tubesomes are first function as gas&#8208;releasing nanovehicles. By shaping the polymersomes via membrane stretching, one can regulate their length&#8208;diameter ratio (L/D). Such tubesomes can respond to endogenous cysteine to release H2S gas, and an unexpected discovery is that as compared to the spherical carriers, the tubular ones behave far better gas releasing capacity. More importantly, the L/D parameter of tubesomes can dictate the gas releasing kinetics and gas therapeutic efficacy on cancer.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the three gas signaling molecules, not only plays a vital role in mediating a series of cellular activities but also manifests exciting applications in clinical therapy. However, one main obstacle in using H2S as a gaseous therapeutic agent is to realize on&#8208;demand storage and delivery of gas, and thus, it is of great importance to develop H2S&#8208;donating vehicle platforms. Although a variety of polymer&#8208;based gas&#8208;releasing carriers have been designed, almost all the systems are limited to spherical structures. Here we explore the role of polymer self&#8208;assembled morphologies, especially toward those non&#8208;spherical nanostructures, on the H2S release capacity. A kind of tubular polymersomes (i.e. tubesomes), formed by the membrane stretching of polythionoester&#8208;containing block copolymer vesicles, exhibit enhanced cysteine&#8208;responsive H2S&#8208;releasing behavior in contrast to their spherical counterparts. Moreover, we found that the amount and rate of H2S release from diverse polymersomes is relied on the extent of membrane elongation, which allows us to regulate the gas releasing kinetics through tailoring the membrane geometries. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the tubesomes as polymer&#8208;type H2S donors have better anticancer performance than those spherical polymersomes. This would inspire new possibilities to boost gas therapeutic efficacy through shaping the morphology of gas nanovehicles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic photoredox/cobalt/chromium triple catalysis system have been established, for selective 1,4&#8208;hydrocarbonation of readily available 1,3&#8208;enyne precursors, providing a modular synthetic platform for various trisubstituted axially chiral allenes bearing an extra central chirality. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic studies are also conducted.







Abstract
A synergistic photoredox/cobalt/chromium triple catalysis system for regioselective, enantioselective, and diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;hydrocarbonation of readily available 1,3&#8208;enyne precursors was explored, providing a modular synthetic platform for various trisubstituted axially chiral allenes bearing an extra central chirality. The protocol features a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, excellent selectivity, and mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism is proposed based on numerous control experiments and density functional theory calculations.

         <dc:description>Protein clustering/disassembling is a fundamental process in biomolecular condensates, playing&#160;crucial roles in cell fate decision and cellular homeostasis. However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral&#8208;tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an "amphiphilic" AIEgen&#160;QMSO3Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the probe&#160;achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous environment and lipophilic organelles, ensuring an ultra&#8208;low background&#8208;interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering&#8208;dependent ultra&#8208;sensitive response, with a substantial lighting&#8208;up fluorescence (67.5&#8208;fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of IRE1&#160;clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. For the first time, we have demonstrated the use of chemigenetic probe to reveal therapy&#8208;induced ER stress and screen drugs in&#160;three&#8208;dimensional scenario: microviscosity change, clustering dynamic, and cluster morphology. This chemigenetic probe design strategy would greatly facilitate the advancement of mapping protein dynamics in cell homeostasis and medicine research.</dc:description>

         <title>Buffered Hydroxyl Radical for Photocatalytic Non&#8208;Oxidative Methane Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven chemical cycle to generate &#8901;OH buffer, in which SO42&#8722; moderates &#8901;OH concentration by balancing &#8901;OH generation from excited&#8208;state [FeIII(SO4)(H2O)5]+ and the back reaction between &#8901;OH and Fe2+.







Abstract
Hydroxy radical (&#8901;OH) is a prestigious oxidant that allows the cleavage of strong chemical bonds of methane but is untamed, leading to over&#8208;oxidation of methane and waste of oxidants, especially at high methane conversion. Here, we managed to buffer &#8901;OH in an aqueous solution of photo&#8208;irradiated Fe3+, where &#8901;OH almost participates in methane oxidation. Due to the interaction between Fe3+ and SO42&#8722;, the electron transfer from OH&#8722; to excited&#8208;state Fe3+ for &#8901;OH generation is retarded, while excessive &#8901;OH is consumed by generated Fe2+ to restore Fe3+. When combined with a Ru/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalyst, the buffered &#8901;OH converts methane to C2+ hydrocarbons and H2 with formation rates of 246 and 418&#8197;&#956;mol h&#8722;1, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches 13.0&#177;0.2&#8201;%, along with 10.2&#8201;% methane conversion and 81&#8201;% C2+ selectivity after 80&#8197;hours of reaction. Overall, this work presents a strategy for controlling active radicals for selective and efficient photocatalysis.

         <title>Isolated Neutral Organic Radical Unveiled Solvent&#8208;Radical Interaction in Highly Reducing Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated neutral helicene radical revealed the missing link in highly photoreducing consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) mechanism. Extensive mechanistic studies implied interaction of short&#8208;lived, non&#8208;emissive photoexcited radical and acetonitrile that generates reduced solvent. To that end, numerous extreme photoreduction have been showcased through useful functionalization of aryl halides using reduced solvent mediated conPET method.







Abstract
Diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics is a key mechanistic debate when consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) is discussed in photoredox catalysis. In&#8197;situ generated organic photoactive radicals can access catalytic systems as reducing as alkaline metals that can activate remarkably stable bonds. However, in many cases, the extremely short&#8208;lived transient nature of these doublet state open&#8208;shell species has led to debatable mechanistic studies, hindering adoption and development. Herein, we document the use of an isolated and stable neutral organic nPrDMQA radical as a highly photoreducing species. The isolated radical offers a unique platform to investigate the mechanism behind the photocatalytic activity of organic photocatalyst radicals. The involvement of reduced solvent is observed, formed by single electron transfer (SET) between the short&#8208;lived excited state nPrDMQA radical and the solvent. In our detailed mechanistic studies, spectroscopic and chemical affirmation of solvent reduction is strongly evident. Reduction of aryl halides, including difluoroarenes is presented as a model study of the conPET method. Further, the activation of N2O, a greenhouse gas that is yet to be activated by photoredox catalysis, is showcased in the absence of a transition metal.

         <title>Organoboron&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Nanosheets for Highly Efficient CO2 Fixation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organoboron functionalized ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8208;organic nanosheet, termed TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS, featuring highly exposed Lewis acidic B and formate sites, and efficient substrates/products diffusion ability, which presents dramatically improved CO2 conversion to bioactive benzimidazoles via formate&#8208;assisted FLP&#8208;mediated catalysis pathway than the parent TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;3D counterpart.







Abstract
Converting CO2 to high&#8208;value fine chemicals represents one of the most promising approaches to combat global warming and subsequently achieve a sustainable carbon cycle. Herein, we contribute an organoboron functionalized ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8208;organic nanosheet (MON), termed TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS, featuring an abundance of exposed Lewis acidic B and formate sites, which can effectively promote CO2 conversion upon the addition of Lewis basic o&#8208;phenylenediamines. Compared with the prototypical 3D analogue TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;3D, the resultant TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS showcases dramatically improved catalytic activity for the cyclization of o&#8208;phenylenediamine as a result of the highly exposed active sites and efficient substrates/products diffusion. Strikingly, the incorporation of Lewis acidic B sites into ultra&#8208;thin Zr&#8208;based MON (Zr&#8208;MON) not only promotes the highly efficient CO2 conversion, but also enhances the recyclability/durability of catalysts. Additionally, the underlying catalytic mechanism has been well established by the comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, unveiling a formate&#8208;assisted frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) mediated catalytic pathway. This work opens up a new avenue to heterogeneous FLP&#8208;based catalysts for small molecule activation and beyond.

         <title>Regulation of TADF by Internal and External Heavy Atom Effect in D&#8208;A MOF for Heterocrystal based Temperature&#8208;Compensated Photonic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facilely tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was realized by synergy of internal and external heavy atom effect induced by decorated &#8208;Br on different components in donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic frameworks (D&#8722;A MOFs). Photonic temperature compensated device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary tendency of temperature&#8208;dependent emission intensity, indicating a potential paradigm in photonic integrated circuits (PICs).







Abstract
The application of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device is hampered by poor accuracy and overly simplistic functions of propagation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) field. Herein, we report a new library of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8722;A MOF) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and the fabricating of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device by virtue of the unique temperature response character of TADF emitters. Highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) of TADF was realized within the D&#8722;A MOFs through a novel strategy that synergistically combines the internal heavy atom effect (HAE) with an external HAE, induced by the incorporation of heavy atoms into different components, achieving the regulable photophysical indicators including adjustable PL wavelength (534 to 592&#8197;nm) and surging quantum yield (5.02&#8201;%&#8211;47.39&#8201;%). Further investigation of the impact of external HAE on TADF was conducted through crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface plots of four D&#8722;A regimes featuring substituent&#8208;based linkers. Notably, temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary temperature response. The emission signal output of the heterojunction remained nearly stable in 215&#8197;K to 295&#8197;K range, highlighting the promising potential application of TADF D&#8722;A MOF featuring sensitive temperature response in PICs field.

The emission signal output of the heterojunction remained nearly stable in 215&#8197;K to 295&#8197;K range, highlighting the promising potential application of TADF D&#8722;A MOF featuring sensitive temperature response in PICs field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Approach to Isotactic Alternating Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been widely employed for various biomedical applications owing to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. The discovery of the stereocomplex formation between enantiomeric alternating PLGA pairs underscored its potential as high&#8208;performance biodegradable materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability. Herein, we have established a regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization approach for the synthesis of stereocomplexed isoenriched alternating PLGA from racemic methyl&#8208;glycolide (rac&#8208;MG). The high sequence and tacticity control was accomplished by an optimized enantiopure scandium catalyst bearing a spiro&#8208;salen scaffold. Varying polymer stereoregularity Pm from 0.4 to 0.91 led to a transformation of the resulting alternating PLGA from amorphous to semicrystalline materials. Notably, the stereocomplexed alternating PLGA demonstrated enhanced melting transition temperature (Tm up to 191 &#176;C) and crystallization rate. This regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled polymerization represented a versatile approach for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>AA&#8208;Stacked Hydrogen&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for Enhanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) has been considered a promising electrode material&#160;for application in electrochemical energy storage. However, studies on GDY featuring an ordered interlayer stacking are lacking, which is supposed to be another effective way to increase lithium binding sites and diffusion pathways. Herein, we synthesized a hydrogen&#8208;substituted GDY (HsGDY) with a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacking structure&#160;via a facile alcohol&#8208;thermal method. &#160;Such unique architecture enables a rapid lithium transfer through the well&#8208;organized pore channels and endows a stronger adsorption capability to lithium atom as compared to the arbitrarily&#8208;stacked mode. The resultant HsGDY exhibits a reversible capacity of 1040 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1&#160;ranking among the most powerful GDY&#8208;based electrode materials, and an excellent rate performance&#160;as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability. The successful preparation&#160;of gram&#8208;level high&#8208;quality HsGDY products in batches implies the&#160;potential for large&#8208;scale lithium&#8208;storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Lowering Linker Symmetry to Access Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Inverse Alkane/Alkene Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enriching the structural diversity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great importance in developing functional porous materials with specific properties. New MOF structures can be accessed through the rational design of organic linkers with diverse geometric conformations, and their structural complexity can be enhanced by choosing linkers with reduced symmetry. Herein, a series of Zr&#8208;based MOFs with unprecedented topologies were developed through a linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach. A tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs (denoted as NU&#8208;57, NU&#8208;58, and NU&#8208;59) by modulating synthetic conditions. Notably, the conformational flexibility and reduced symmetry of the linker generated two unprecedented topologies in NU&#8208;58 and NU&#8208;59. Furthermore, solvent removal in NU&#8208;58 via thermal activation process produced missing linker defects. Finally, the adsorption behavior of these MOFs towards alkanes and alkenes was studied to gain insights into their structure&#8208;property relationships, which demonstrated that NU&#8208;57 and NU&#8208;58 exhibit unusual reverse selectivity for alkanes in alkane/alkene separations. Overall, this work highlights the rational design of linkers using a desymmetrization strategy as a powerful method to enrich the structural diversity of MOFs and to access novel MOFs with unique properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of Bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bryostatins are a family of marine natural products that have garnered significant interests, as evidenced by over 40 clinical trials. However, their extremely low natural abundance has severely limited further research. Despite significant efforts, which have led to the total synthesis of seven bryostatin members by eight independent research groups, these complex molecules present persistent challenges for stereocontrolled, large&#8208;scale, and especially divergent synthesis. Here, we report the divergent total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3. Notably, 1.5 g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. Key transformations include Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling to rapidly assemble the northern fragment, the flow chemistry&#8208;assisted visible light&#8208;induced alkyl radical conjugate addition to convergently construct the southern fragment, and an intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization to establish the cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3% to 4.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>COF&#8208;assisted construction of steric mass&#8208;charge channels to boost activity for high&#8208;performance fuel cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;dimensional lamellar materials disperse platinum sites and minimize noble&#8208;metal usage for fuel cells, while mass transport resistance at the stacked layers spurs device failure with a significant performance decline in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Herein, we implant porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks (COF) into the graphene&#8208;based catalytic layer for the construction of steric mass&#8208;charge channels, which highly facilitates the activity of oxygen reduction reactions in both the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements and MEA device tests. Specifically, the normalized mass activity is remarkably boosted by 3.7 times to 1.56 A mgpt&#8208;1 after additions of suitable COF modifications in the RDE tests. Especially, an excellent maximum power density of 1.015 W cm&#8208;2 is realized on the MEA in H2/Air condition, representing a 22% improvement through such constructions of steric mass&#8208;charge channels. Meanwhile, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of fuel cells demonstrates only 0.8% reductions after 10,000 cycles of stability tests. We further extended such methodology of constructing mass&#8208;charge channels to granular PtCo and commercial Pt/C catalysts, which demonstrates a significant impetus for stimulating the catalytic activity in fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Interface Enabled by a Guest&#8208;Anionic Chemistry for High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor reversibility of the zinc anode caused by interfacial side reactions and dendritic growth poses significant constraints on the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a co&#8208;solute, acesulfame potassium, with strongly polar, zincophilic guest anions is introduced into a conventional low&#8208;concentration aqueous electrolyte. This regulation enhances the electrolyte's ionic conductivity and accelerates the desolvation process of zinc ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface.Furthermore, the introduced acesulfame anions give rise to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface with a hierarchical crystalline&#8208;amorphous bilayer structure that effectively suppresses side reactions and allows for uniform zinc ion diffusion&#8208;deposition. Results show that the zinc anode in the designed electrolyte possesses remarkable reversibility, achieving stable operation under a ultrahigh current density of 40 mA cm&#8208;2 and 67.6 % depth of discharge, surpassing most previous reports. Zn//I2 full cells assembled with this electrolyte exhibit high rate capability (135.0 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1) and remarkable lifespan (96.3% capacity retention after 40,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1). A large&#8208;sized Zn//I2 pouch cell is also demonstrated, delivering a total capacity of 170 mAh with 78.8% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 3.3 mA cm&#8208;2, highlighting the potential of the guest&#8208;anionic chemistry in practical applications.</dc:description>

Zn//I2 full cells assembled with this electrolyte exhibit high rate capability (135.0 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1) and remarkable lifespan (96.3% capacity retention after 40,000 cycles at 10 A g-1). A large-sized Zn//I2 pouch cell is also demonstrated, delivering a total capacity of 170 mAh with 78.8% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 3.3 mA cm-2, highlighting the potential of the guest-anionic chemistry in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Hydrogen Production Coupled with Glucose Valorization through Modulating Au&#8208;Pt Coordination on Ultrathin Au3Pt Twin Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organics electrooxidation coupled hydrogen production has attracted increasing attention due to the low operation voltage. Nevertheless, the spontaneous production of hydrogen coupled with organics valorization remains challenging. Herein, we develop ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowire (NW) catalysts for both electrochemical glucose oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction towards a spontaneous hydrogen production system. The more Pt&#8208;Au coordination and the localized tensile strain generated on twin boundaries of Au3Pt NWs facilitate the selective glucose electro&#8208;oxidation to gluconic acid (GNA) compared to Pt NWs (a low onset potential of 0.07 VRHE and selectivity &gt; 90%). In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that Au3Pt NWs could reduce the energy barriers for GNA generation and alleviate the poisoning of Pt sites via a 'Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer' mechanism, which facilitates the desorption of strongly absorbed gluconolactone. Therefore, the asymmetric cell equipped with Au3Pt NW catalysts realizes the spontaneous hydrogen production and glucose valorization with a peak power of 50 mW, which outputs the voltage of 0.24 V at 50 mA cm&#8208;2, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The production of 1 kg H2 of the device is accompanied with $64.2 valorization of the anode product ($1200 ton&#8208;1 for GNA), and 5.36 kW h of generated electricity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Open&#8208;Shell Organic Radical in Enhancing Anti&#8208;Tumor Photocatalysis Reaction of NIR Light&#8208;Activated Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell radical materials, which are characterized by unpaired electrons, have led to revolutionary breakthroughs in material science due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the involvement of organic radicals in photodynamic therapy (PDT) has rarely been reported or discussed. This work studies two photosensitizer analogs. 4AM&#8208;OS with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation exhibits open&#8208;shell radical characters and enhanced type&#8208;I photodynamic activity compared with closed&#8208;shell 2AM&#8208;CS. 4AM&#8208;OS displays the thermally accessible triplet&#8208;state character, resulting in more unpaired electrons delocalized along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone at higher temperatures. Accordingly, the temperature&#8208;dependent photodynamic activity of 4AM&#8208;OS confirms its association with the open&#8208;shell electronic structure. As the unpaired electrons in open&#8208;shell 4AM&#8208;OS are more delocalized and generate additional electronic energy states, photo&#8208;induced charge transfer is promoted to facilitate type&#8208;I photodynamic reactions. This observation addresses the challenge associated with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, such as 4AM&#8208;OS, which often demonstrate low efficacy in PDT due to the limited energy provided by NIR light despite its superior tissue penetration depth. Overall, clarifying the beneficial role of organic radicals in photodynamic reactions will bring revolutionary breakthroughs to developing high&#8208;performance NIR photosensitizers and promoting the efficacy of PDT for deep&#8208;seated lesions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Single Selenium Site for Selective Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Learning from nature has garnered significant attention in the scientific community for its potential to inspire creative solutions in material or catalyst design. The study reports a biomimetic single selenium (Se) site&#8208;modified carbon (C) moiety that retains the unique reactivity of selenoenzyme with peroxides, aiming to selectively catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The as&#8208;designed Se&#8208;C demonstrates nearly 100% 4&#8208;electron selectivity, evidenced by 0.039% of H2O2 yield at 0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming commercial platinum (Pt) by 65 times. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations attribute this exceptional selectivity to the enzyme&#8208;like behaviors of the Se site to steal an O atom from peroxide intermediates. The second achievement is the significantly increased consecutive 2+2 electron selectivity. Benefiting from the enzyme&#8208;like H2O2 reduction activity with a higher onset potential of 0.915 V compared to Pt at 0.875 V, the Se&#8208;C as a secondary catalytic site reduced the H2O2 yields of the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, and N&#8208;C catalysts by 96%, 67%, and 98%, respectively, via a consecutive 2+2 electron pathway. This also leads to more stable catalysts via protecting the active sites from oxidative attacks. This work establishes new pathways for precise tuning of reaction selectivity in ORR and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Reprocessable and Recyclable Materials for 3D Printing via Reversible Thia&#8208;Michael Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemically recyclable polymers for sustainable 3D printing is crucial to reducing plastic waste and advancing towards a circular polymer economy. Here, we introduce a new class of polythioenones (PCTE) synthesized via Michael addition&#8208;elimination ring&#8208;opening polymerization (MAEROP) of cyclic thioenone (CTE) monomers. The designed monomers are straightforward to synthesize, scalable and highly modular, and the resulting polymers display mechanical performance superior to commodity polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The material was successfully employed in 3D printing using fused&#8208;filament fabrication (FFF), showcasing excellent printability and mechanical recyclability. Notably, PCTE&#8208;Ph retains its tensile strength and thermal stability after multiple mechanical recycling cycles. Furthermore, PCTE&#8208;Ph can be depolymerized back to its original monomer with a 90% yield, allowing for repolymerization and establishing a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle, making it a sustainable alternative for additive manufacturing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Methane to Ethane and Propane Using Cobalt&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Activated GaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of methane (PNOCM) offers a promising route to synthesize valuable C2+ hydrocarbons while minimizing side reactions. Oxide&#8208;based photocatalysts have been predominant in this field, but suffering from limited conversion rates, selectivity, and durability due to poor C&#8208;C coupling as well as overoxidation of CH4 by lattice oxygen. Here, we introduce an advancement in PNOCM for methane conversion into ethane and propane using GaN, one of the most produced semiconductors, together with trace amounts of metallic cobalt clusters (0.1 wt%). The photocatalytic system exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining performance over 110 hours, achieving conversion rates of approximately 192.3 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for ethane and ~17.9 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for propane, with virtually no coke byproducts detected, representing the highest activity and stability ever reported to our knowledge. This high activity is attributed to the critical methane activation and C&#8208;C coupling on Co cluster, which can be greatly accelerated via the ultrafast photogenerated charge transfer from p&#8208;GaN to Co cluster. Additionally, the GaN support further synergistically enhances methane activation by in situ generating N&#8208;H and O&#8208;H species under reaction, as well as provides a vital anti&#8208;overoxidation effect to CH4 for high selectivity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Dual&#8208;Layered Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by Cation Specific Adsorption&#8208;Induced Built&#8208;In Electrostatic Field for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation battery technologies due to their high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, interfacial issues such as side reactions and Li dendrite growth severely hinder the practical application of SSLMBs. In this contribution, we proposed a cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field to drive the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The specific adsorption of tributylmethyl&#8208;phosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TMPB) cations onto negatively charged Li anode surface significantly prevents interfacial side reactions between vulnerable polyethylene oxide (PEO) and Li metal. More importantly, the formed cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field induces the targeted trapping of Li&#8208;salt anions onto the Li metal surface, leading to the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered SEI, composed of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a Li&#8208;ion conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer. As a result, the Li||Li cell demonstrated an extended lifespan of over 1900 hours with the reduced polarization voltage. The Li||LiFePO4 full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability, maintaining an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.69% over 200 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides valuable insights into mitigating interfacial degradation and promoting uniform Li deposition through surface electrostatic field regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Active Site Covalent Organic Framework Anode Enables Stable Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous proton batteries&#160;(APBs) have attracted increasing interest owing to their potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage with extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, there are limited anode materials and it remains a great challenge to effectively balance capacity and cycling performance. Here, we report a covalent organic framework containing C=O and C=N dual active sites (TABQ&#8208;COF) as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle anode for proton batteries. The proton storage ability of the dual active sites and the up to nine proton redox chemistry mechanisms for each repetitive unit have been demonstrated by experiments and density functional theory calculations. The insoluble TABQ&#8208;COF electrode displayed a remarkably high specific capacity of 401 mAh g&#8722;1, outstanding cycling stability (100% capacity retention after 7500 cycles) and high rate performance (90 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1). When coupling with a MnO2 cathode, the constructed TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery achieves a reversible capacity of 247 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1,&#160;with a remarkable capacity retention of 100% over 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery can operate well and shows high capacity and cycle stability in a frozen electrolyte at &#8722;40&#176;C, implying great potential for energy storage at extreme temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;sensitive polyglycerol nanogels for periodontitis treatment through antibacterial and pro&#8208;angiogenesis action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Periodontitis is a microbe&#8208;driven inflammatory disease leading to bone resorption and tissue destruction. We propose a dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO) for combating microbial pathogens and promoting tissue regeneration. The nanogel system (NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO) that we fabricated from linear polyglycerol exhibits well&#8208;defined spherical morphology and a positively charged surface for bacteria adhesion. The rapid and sustained degradation of NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO in the acidic environment of an infection site induces the on&#8208;demand release of TCS and DFO. The NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO shows potent bacteria elimination of the gingivitis&#8208;causing bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis in both planktonic (99.9%) and biofilm (99%) states. Furthermore, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO can promote vascularization and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Contributing to the synergistic effect of TCS and DFO, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO demonstrates significant bone tissue regeneration and accelerated healing of periodontitis in vivo. This polyglycerol&#8208;based nanogel may therefore offer smart combined delivery of multiple therapeutics against bacteria&#8208;driven diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;CO2 Battery at Elevated Temperatures: Advances with Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne and Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;CO2 batteries demonstrate promising prospects in terms of high&#8208;density energy storage and efficient CO2 fixation. However, their practical application is impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics and leakage of volatile and flammable organic electrolytes, especially for high temperature application scenarios, leading to large polarization and limited cycling stability. Herein, we fabricate a highly rechargeable and stable Li&#8208;CO2 battery with high temperature adaptability by employing fluorine&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvents. The employed FGDY, which possesses homogeneous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon, high specific surface area, and uniform pores, significantly enhances the battery reaction kinetics. Consequently, the fabricated Li&#8208;CO2 batteries operate consistently at a large current density of 5.0 A&#183;g&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C while showcasing high discharge capacity of 29050 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 along with excellent cycling stability. As proof of concept, Li&#8208;CO2 pouch cells achieve a high energy density of 536 Wh&#183;kg&#8208;1 based on the total mass of the device, and show outstanding cycling stability at 80 &#176;C. This study underscores the effectiveness of graphdiyne&#8208;derived carbon catalysts in achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Water Molecules via Bioinspired Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Zn metal anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) faces daunting challenges including undesired water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and sluggish ion migration kinetics. Herein, we develop three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with bioinspired ion channels toward stabilized Zn anodes. These COFs, featured by zincophilic pyridine&#8208;N sites, enable effective regulation of water molecules at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Systematic experimental analysis and theoretical simulations reveal the optimized COF&#8208;320N membrane functions as ion pumps, accordingly facilitating Zn2+ transport and inhibiting direct contact between Zn anode and free water molecules. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired strategy achieves improved Zn2+ transference number (0.61), rapid de&#8208;solvation kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution. The assembled Zn||MnO2 pouch cell integrated with COF&#8208;320N membrane exhibits favorable electrochemical performances. Such a bioinspired concept for optimizing Zn anodes opens new pathways in developing advanced energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate Interaction to Activate C&#8722;N Bond for Exceptional Photoelectrochemical Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoelectrochemical (PEC) urea oxidation reaction (UOR) presents a promising half&#8208;reaction for green hydrogen production, but the stable resonance structure of the urea molecule results in sluggish kinetics for breaking the C&#8722;N bond. Herein, we realize the record PEC UOR performance on a NiO&#8208;modified n&#8208;Si photoanode (NiO@Ni/n&#8208;Si) by harnessing the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction. We quantificationally unveil a dependence of the UOR activation barrier on the coverage of photogenerated surface high&#8208;valent Ni&#8208;oxo species (NiIV=O) by employing operando PEC spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations. The strong attraction between NiIV=O and adsorbed urea facilitates their N&#8722;O coupling while weakening the C&#8722;N bonding within urea, manifesting as the decreased UOR activation energy from 0.74 to 0.41 eV when the surface coverage of NiIV=O is enhanced from zero to full, corresponding to more than two orders of magnitude enhancement for the UOR rate. Furthermore, an industrial&#8208;grade photocurrent density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at a potential as low as 1.08 VRHE by stimulating the NiIV=O accumulation under 10 Suns, which is 300 mV lower than the potential required for most reported electrochemical counterparts. This work opens new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance PEC urea oxidation via adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction.</dc:description>

Furthermore, an industrial-grade photocurrent density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at a potential as low as 1.08 VRHE by stimulating the NiIV=O accumulation under 10 Suns, which is 300 mV lower than the potential required for most reported electrochemical counterparts. This work opens new prospects for achieving high-performance PEC urea oxidation via adsorbate-adsorbate interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superconjugated Anthraquinone Carbonyl&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Material for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently been emerged as promising anode candidates for aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AAIBs), but suitable COFs need to be developed and the energy storage mechanisms need to be further investigated. Here we report an anthraquinone carbonyl&#8208;containing COF as anode for AAIBs, which exhibits a high specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and good cycling stability with 90% retention after 8000 cycles at 6 A g&#8208;1. We find that the anthraquinone carbonyls (denoted as C=O1) with superconjugated structure in the COF can form hydrogen bonds with NH4+ ions, thus serving as optimal sites and providing the major contribution to NH4+ ion storage, whereas another type of carbonyls (denoted as C=O2) in the same COF suffers from enol&#8208;keto tautomerism, which prevents the formation of hydrogen bonds and is therefore unfavourable for NH4+ ion storage. This is further verified by the theoretical calculations where the hydrogen bonding rate of C=O1 groups is much faster than that of C=O2. This work not only provides insights into understanding the mechanism of NH4+ ion storage, but also offers new ideas for the design of advanced COF&#8208;based materials for AAIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Employing Octahedral Net Charge Descriptors for Designing High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, aqueous proton batteries have shown promise for electrochemical energy storage using MXene electrodes. However, designing high&#8208;performance MXene proton batteries remains challenging due to the inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the vast chemical composition space of MXene, and the unclear proton transport mechanism. To tackle these challenges, we established a general descriptor based on structural units of MXenes, termed the octahedral net charge descriptor (Qoct). This descriptor correlates well with HER activity, capacity, and proton transport performance. Based on the descriptor, prediction reveals a dual&#8208;proton storage mechanism per site in N&#8208;functionalized MXene. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the descriptor is verified across a broader MXene chemical space. Additionally, the kinetic process shows the topological transformation energy barrier of the interfacial solution is profoundly influenced by Qoct, thereby impacting the proton transfer performance. This universal descriptor originates from the different electron filling states on the molecular orbitals of the octahedron. Overall, this work provides an efficient strategy for designing MXene proton batteries and can be extended to other battery and catalysis fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct Valence States of the [4Fe4S] Cluster Revealed in the Hydrogenase CrHydA1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters play a crucial role in electron transfer for many essential enzymes, including [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This study focuses on the [4Fe4S] cluster ([4Fe]H) of the minimal&#160;[FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from&#160;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&#160;(CrHydA1) and employs advanced spectroscopy, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and QM/MM calculations. We provide insights into the complex electronic structure of&#160;[4Fe]H&#160;and its role in the catalytic reaction of&#160;CrHydA1, serving as paradigm for understanding [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. We identified at least two distinct species&#160;within the apo&#8208;form of&#160;CrHydA1, designated 4Fe&#8208;R and 4Fe&#8208;A, with unique redox potentials and pH sensitivities. Our findings revealed that these species arise from a complex interplay of structural heterogeneity and valence isomer rearrangements, influenced by second&#8208;sphere residues. We propose that the interconversion between 4Fe&#8208;R and 4Fe&#8208;A could provide control over electron transfer in the absence of accessory FeS clusters typically found in other [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The insights gained from this study not only enhance our understanding of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases but also provide a crucial foundation for future investigations into analysis of other FeS clusters across diverse biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting C&#8208;O Bond Cleavage and Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Activity via Enriched in&#8208;plane Sulfur Vacancies in Single&#8208;Layer Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of CO2 to CO provides a promising approach to the production of valuable chemicals through CO2 utilization. However, challenges persist with the rapid deactivation and insufficient activity of catalysts. Herein, we developed a soft&#8208;hard dual&#8208;template method to synthesize layered MoS2 using inexpensive and scalable templates, enabling facile regulation of sulfur vacancies by controlling the number of layers. The concentration of in&#8208;plane vacancies keeps increasing with the reduction of MoS2 layer number, contributing to 100% CO selectivity over single&#8208;layer MoS2 and a stable performance over 300&#8208;hour reaction at 600 &#176;C. The space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of CO reached 35.7 gCO gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, outperforming most current catalysts. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancy sites endowed enhanced production of CO via direct dissociation of CO2, showing an intrinsic activity of above 5.8 times higher than that of edge sulfur vacancy sites. The rate&#8208;limiting step was shifted from C&#8208;O cleavage in edge to sulfur vacancy regeneration in plane with a lower energy barrier. Our findings exemplified the specified design and synthesis of MoS2 for high&#8208;temperature CO2 reduction through the effective manipulation of distinct vacancy sites, shedding light on their potential industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>Easily Water&#8208;Synthesisable Iron&#8208;Chloranilate Frameworks as High Energy and High&#8208;Power Cathodes for Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high battery performance from low&#8208;cost, easily synthesisable electrode materials is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) combining inexpensive transition metals and organic ligands are promising candidates for high&#8208;capacity cathodes. Iron&#8208;chloranilate&#8208;water frameworks are herein reported to be produced in aqueous media under mild conditions. Removal of reticular water from known [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]&#183;4H2O yields a new supramolecular metal&#8208;organic framework (SMOF), [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]. Removing coordination water, a new 2D honeycomb&#8208;like MOF forms, Fe2(CAN)3, stable without counterions and solvent. This MOF adopts the unusual ABC layer&#8208;stacking, as determined using a combination of ab initio random structure searching, electron diffraction, and Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data. Magnetometry, Mossbauer and Raman spectroscopy confirm that all three [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)x]&#183;yH2O phases contain HS&#8208;Fe3+ and CAN2&#8211;, with magnetic ordering temperatures increasing (5&#8594;20K) as the Fe&#8211;CAN connectivity increases. The SMOF and MOF show reversible (de)insertion of &gt;4Li+/f.u. at average 2.59 V and 2.76 V vs Li+/Li, respectively. [Fe2(CAN)3] achieves 146 mAh/g at 1C, thus specific energy (563 Wh/kg) and power (446 W/kg) in Li half&#8208;cells competitive with conventional LiFePO4 (~580 Wh/kg and ~450 W/kg). Beyond Li, [Fe2(CAN)3] delivers 394 Wh/kg and 421 Wh/kg, for Na and K half&#8208;cells respectively, becoming a competitive cathode for sustainable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiscale Engineered Bionic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes Breaking the Stiffness&#8208;Damping Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries are regarded as next&#8208;generation devices for energy storage due to their safety and high energy density. The issues of lithium dendrites and poor mechanical compatibility with electrodes present the need for developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high stiffness and damping, but it is a contradictory relationship. Here, inspired by the superstructure of tooth enamel, we develop a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous ceramic nanotube arrays intertwined with solid polymer electrolytes. This bionic electrolyte exhibits both high stiffness (Young&#8242;s modulus=15GPa, hardness = 0.13GPa) and damping (tan&#948;= 0.08), breaking the trade&#8208;off. Thus, this composite electrolyte can not only inhibit Li dendrites growth but also ensure intimate contact with electrodes. Meanwhile, it also exhibits considerable Li+ transference number (0.62) and room temperature ionic conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1), which is attributed to oxygen vacancies of the amorphous ceramic effectively decoupling the Li&#8722;TFSI ion pair. Consequently, the assembled Li symmetrical battery shows an ultra&#8208;stable cycling (&gt;2000 hours at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2 at 60 &#176;C, &gt;500hours at 0.1mA cm&#8722;2 at 30 &#176;C). Moreover, the LiFePO4/Li and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells both show excellent cycling performance. We demonstrate that this bionic strategy is a promising approach for the development of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium metal batteries are regarded as next-generation devices for energy storage due to their safety and high energy density.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions on Functionalized Porous Aromatic Cages for Gold Recovery from Complex Aqueous with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#160;capacity, selective recovery and separation of precious metals from complex aqueous solutions is essential but remains a challenge in practical applications.&#160;Here, we prepared a thiophene&#8208;modified aromatic porous organic cage (T&#8208;PAC) with high stability for precise recognition and recovery of gold. T&#8208;PAC exhibits an outstanding gold uptake capacity of up to 2260 mg/g with fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption selectivity. It's also used to selectively recover gold from a variety of complex aqueous solutions in a stable and efficient manner.&#160;The theoretical calculations and dedicated experiments suggest that anion&#8208;&#960;&#160;interactions between the [AuCl4]&#8208;&#160;and TFP fractions on T&#8208;PAC cooperated with S/N boning and redox&#160;effects play the decisive role in the highly efficient gold recovery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixture through Adaptive Recognition Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step adsorptive purification of ethylene (C2H4) from ternary mixture comprising of acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is a great challenge in the chemical industry. Herein, a microporous metal&#8208;organic framework (FJI&#8208;H38) has been reported, which&#160;possesses a high density of electronegative O/N binding sites and appropriate pore size. Notably, at 0.01 bar and 298 K FJI&#8208;H38 shows excellent trapping capability for C2H2 (1.64 mmol/g) and CO2 (2.33 mmol/g), while the uptake of C2H4 is only 0.41 mmol/g, which endows FJI&#8208;H38 high C2H2/C2H4 selectivity and top&#8208;level CO2/C2H4 simultaneously. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&#8805;99.95%) with record&#8208;high productivity can be successfully obtained from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixture in one step under various conditions. Even at 318 K, the separation performance has no obvious decrease. Such excellent separation performance is due to the adaptive recognition of C2H2 and CO2 by FJI&#8208;H38 through the synergistic effect of appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials, where C2H2 and CO2 can be stabilized by the O/N and aromatic ring sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Pressure on Metavalent Bonding in BiTe influencing Electronic Topological Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BiTe, a member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series, possesses natural van der Waals&#8208;like heterostructure with a Bi2 bilayer sandwiched between the two [Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te&#8208;Bi&#8208;Te] quintuple layers. BiTe exhibits both the quantum states of weak topological and topological crystalline insulators, making it a dual topological insulator and a suitable candidate for spintronics, quantum computing and thermoelectrics. Herein, we demonstrate that the chemical bonding in BiTe is to be metavalent, which plays a significant role in the pressure dependent change in the topology of the electronic structure Fermi surface. The enhancement of the metavalent bonding character with pressure in BiTe is evidenced from first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to the change in the Fermi surface topology, we have visualized electronic topological transitions (ETT) at 1 and 3 GPa through pressure dependent synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The correlation between the metavalent bonding and ETT offers insights into chemical bonding influenced transitions in quantum materials.</dc:description>

         <title>From Natural Product Derivative to Hexagonal Prism Supermolecule: Potent Biofilm Disintegration, Enhanced Foliar Affinity, and Effective Management of Tomato Bacterial Canker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clavibacter michiganensis (Cmm), designated as an A2 quarantine pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), incites bacterial canker of tomato, which presently eludes rapid and effective control methodologies. Dense biofilms formed by Cmm shield internal bacteria from host immune defenses and obstruct the ingress of agrochemicals. Even when agrochemicals disintegrate biofilms, splashing and bouncing during application disperse active ingredients away from target sites. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate a hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped material, BPGA@CB[8], assembled from an 18&#946;&#8208;glycyrrhetinic acid derivative (PBGA) and host molecule&#8212;cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) via host&#8208;guest recognition. This positively charged material manifests multifaceted functionalities, notably the ability to surmount biofilm barriers, annihilate the encased pathogenic bacteria, and enhance foliar affinity of droplets. The strong in vitro potency and effective deposition of BPGA@CB[8] foster optimal conditions for robust in vivo efficacy, demonstrating superior protective and curative activities (56.9%/53.4%) against canker of tomato at a low&#8208;dose of 100 &#956;g&#183;mL&#8208;&#185; compared to BPGA (44.6%/42.2%), kasugamycin (30.1%/28.4%), and thiodiazole copper (35.4%/31.0%). This supramolecular material, based on natural product derivatives, provides a potent treatment for high&#8208;risk canker of tomato, and exemplifies the utility of supramolecular strategies in optimizing the attributes of natural products for managing plant bacterial diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanobiohybrids for High&#8208;Performance Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis via Multi&#8208;Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanobiohybrids for solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis present a promising solution to the global energy crisis. However, conventional semiconductor&#8208;based nanobiohybrids face challenges such as limited tunability and poor biocompatibility, leading to undesirable spontaneous electron and proton transfer that compromise their structural stability and CH4 selectivity. Herein, we introduced eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloys (EGaIn), featuring a self&#8208;limiting surface oxide layer surrounding the liquid metal core after sonication, integrated with Methanosarcina barkeri (M. b). The well&#8208;designed M. b&#8211;EGaIn nanobiohybrids exhibited superior performance, achieving a maximum CH4 yield of 455.64 &#177; 15.99 &#956;mol g&#8722;1, long&#8208;term stability across four successive 7&#8208;day cycles, and remarkable CH4 selectivity of &gt;99%. These improvements stem from enhanced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer involving hydrogen atoms at the core&#8211;shell interface, further facilitated by the elevated expression of hydrogenases at the abiotic&#8211;biotic interface. This study provides an insightful concept for nanobiohybrid design through multi&#8208;interface engineering, advancing sustainable and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;biofuel conversion under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Charge Distribution at Organic&#8208;inorganic Interface via Optimizing Substituents for Sustainable Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The space charge effect induced by high&#8208;quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (&#8208;g = &#8208;CH3, &#8208;H, &#8208;NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc&#8208;g/CoS organic&#8208;inorganic heterostructures. CoPc&#8208;CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of &#8208;CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc&#8208;CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150 h at 0.5 A cm&#8208;2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Enabled Resistance to Water Matrix Components for Selective Degradation of Micropollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent substantial advances in water treatment, the ability to selectively degrade trace micropollutants in real waters with complex matrix components remains a grand challenge. Here we report rational crafting of graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;wrapped defective TiO2 composite catalysts that creates nanoscopic confinement over the TiO2 surface within GO, thereby enabling the selective degradation of micropollutants through effectively excluding natural organic matter (NOM) and anions from the nanoconfined catalytic sites. In contrast to unconfined counterparts, the nanoconfined composite catalysts retain high degradation efficiency when exposed to various concentrations of NOM and anions, even in real water samples. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 promote electron separation and oxygen adsorption, leading to a 4.9&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical concentration within the nanoconfined space compared to the bulk solution. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy unveil the nanoconfined catalytic sites on the TiO2 surface, where micropollutants smaller than the pores of GO are effectively degraded, while NOM with a larger size is excluded by GO. Furthermore, the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts is well controlled due to the exclusion of NOM. This work provides a simple yet viable strategy for designing 2D material&#8208;wrapped catalysts to selectively degrade target micropollutants in complex real waters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand engineering regulation toward Zn ions and Zn substrate for all&#8208;climate&#160;Zn&#160;metal&#160;batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of artificial interphase for advanced Zn anode is an effective solution to achieve superior electrochemical performance for aqueous batteries. However, the deployment of atomically precise architectures and ligand engineering to achieve functionalization&#8208;oriented regulatory screening is lacking, which is hindered by higher requirements for synthetic chemistry and structural chemistry. Herein, we have first performed ligand engineering which selected zinc ion trapping ligands (&#8211;CH3) based on the coordination effect, and zinc substrate binding ligands (&#8211;N=N&#8208;xC6H5) based on the electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, octa nuclear Zn(II)&#8208;Siloxane&#8208;PhPz/BiPhPz/TriPhPz Cluster (OZSPC/OZSBPC/OZSTPC) are accurately synthesized, and OZSBPC is verified to serve as the most suitable artificial interphase via balancing the interactions with both Zn2+ and Zn substrate (&#8220;Zn&#8208;Zn effect&#8221;). Consequently, at &#8211;30 &#176;C, the assembled OZSBPC&#8208;Zn symmetric cells run for 3000 h and the assembled full cells with OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode could be stable for 10,000 cycles. The pouch cells using OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode deliver a reversible capacity of ~1.2 Ah and the energy density of 41 Wh kgtotal&#8722;1 with excellent cycling performance. The successful structural design of OZSBPC explores a novel well&#8208;defined structural design concept as one criterion for artificial interface as well as motivates batteries systems to meet the requirements of industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroglycosylation of Alkynes for the Synthesis of Vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes, employing bench&#8208;stable&#160;ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl (oIB) substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction occurs with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity to afford&#160;E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, a class of compounds nontrivial to access by previous methods. The use of a bis(oxazoline) ligand with bulky side chains is critical for the high selectivities observed. Aryl iodides have not been used previously as surrogates for alkyl (glycosyl) electrophiles in Co&#8208;H catalyzed reactions. The transformation features mild reaction conditions, simple reagents, and broad substrate scope. This method can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring products. Mechanistic studies suggest this stereoconvergent process involves glycosyl radicals as key reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling polynorbornene derivatives into chemically recyclable multiblock linear and thermoset plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic polymers have found widespread use with functional lifetimes from seconds to decades. However, the lack of end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment for these plastics is causing a significant environmental and human health crisis due to their persistence and bioaccumulation. Upcycling post&#8208;consumer plastic waste to products with inherent recyclability is an attractive strategy to tackle this problem, as it can broaden the range of accessible materials and uncover unprecedented features while dealing with current plastic waste. Here, we demonstrate the upcycling of polynorbornene derivatives (pNBEs) including polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets through their transformation into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks which can be repolymerized into chemically recyclable pNBEs&#8208;like multiblock linear and crosslinked plastics. These materials exhibit a diverse set of mechanical properties, while integrate a high melting transition temperature with a broad range of glass transition temperature, controlled by the feed ratio of building blocks. After use, upcycled plastics could be effectively deconstructed back to the oligomers for recovery and repolymerization. Overall, this work establishes an approach that can be utilized to upcycle pNBEs and pDCPD into previously inaccessible multiblock thermoset and thermoplastics with full recyclability, and may be generalizable to a range of polymers to shift their end&#8208;of&#8208;life waste disposal toward sustainable recovery and reuse.</dc:description>

         <title>Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;Small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique gapped and rotated grain boundary is discovered in Au78(TBBT)40, as the first hybrid boundary model in the gold nanoclusters. Au78(TBBT)40 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO compared to a series of face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured nanoparticles with larger or smaller sizes, demonstrating the effectiveness of manipulating GBs to fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance of nanoclusters.







Abstract
Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2&#8197;nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenylthiolate) with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5&#8197;nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibited higher catalytic activity in the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity was explained through density functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, which highlight the impact of GBs and point defects on the surface properties of metal nanoclusters in balancing intermediate adsorption and product desorption.

         <title>Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo3Nb2O14 undergoes the near&#8208;zero volume change upon H+ (de)intercalation in aqueous batteries owing to the open tunnels that buffer the local structure change of Mo/NbOn polyhedra upon charge/discharge. The optimal molecular crowding electrolyte and the structural integrity of Mo3Nb2O14 electrode synergistically establish a highly stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode system, providing a capacity retention of approximately 100&#8201;% over 500 cycles.







Abstract
Managing safety and supply&#8208;chain risks associated with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is an urgent task for sustainable development. Aqueous proton batteries are attractive alternatives to LIBs because using water and protons addresses these two risks. However, most host materials undergo large volume changes upon H+ intercalation, which induces intraparticle cracking to accelerates parasitic reactions. Herein, we report that Mo3Nb2O14 bronze exhibits reversible H+ intercalation (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% owing to near&#8208;zero volume change and solid&#8208;solution&#8208;type phase transition. Combination of experimental and theoretical analyses clarifies that rotation and shrinkage of open tunnels, which consist of flexible corner&#8208;sharing Mo/NbOn polyhedra, relieve local structural distortions upon H+ intercalation to suppress intraparticle cracking. The prototype full cell of an aqueous proton battery with a Mo3Nb2O14 anode operates stably over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This study reveals the importance of implementing distortion&#8208;relieving voids in host materials to reduce volume change upon charge/discharge.

         <title>Restricting Linker Rotation in Nanocages of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes using Crown Ether &#8220;Molecular Locks&#8221; for Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) molecules were in&#8197;situ encapsulated within the sodalite cage of the ZIF&#8208;8 membranes to restrict their flexible pore structure. The resulting 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes exhibited exceptional C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, reaching 220, significantly surpassing most other membranes. Remarkably, as pressure increased, the separation factor continued to rise, achieving a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 at 7&#8197;bar.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have long been prized for their exceptional C3H6/C3H8 separation performance. On the other hand, ZIF&#8208;8 has structural flexibility, where the external pressure triggers channel expansion, potentially deteriorating the molecular sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a reliable strategy to fine&#8208;tune the flexible pore structure of ZIF&#8208;8 by embedding crown ether within a ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) was selected as the cavity occupant and perfectly confined in the sodalite (SOD) cage of ZIF&#8208;8. The 15C5 molecules, which have a size comparable to the nanocage, impose a spatial constraint on linker rotation, enabling the phase transition to a rigid structure in the flexible ZIF&#8208;8. The corresponding 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes achieve an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 220, outperforming that of most membranes. Unlike their flexible counterparts, the resulting membranes manifest a positive increase in the C3H6/C3H8 separation factor with elevated pressure, securing a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 under 7&#8197;bar. More importantly, extraordinary separation stability was demonstrated with continuous measurement, which is highly desirable for practical applications.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;Structured IrOx Foam Platelets as the Building Block of Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>

         <dc:description>
We present honeycomb&#8208;structured IrOx foam platelets as an active and stable OER electrocatalyst, which enables multiscale tuning of the anodic catalyst layer from atomic to microscopic scales in PEM water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Achieving robust long&#8208;term durability with high catalytic activity at low iridium loading remains one of great challenges for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, we report the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of iridium oxide foam platelets comprising edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, and demonstrate the structural advantages of this material for multilevel tuning of anodic catalyst layer across atomic&#8208;to&#8208;microscopic scales for PEMWE. The integration of IrO6 octahedral honeycomb framework, foam&#8208;like texture and platelet morphology into a single material system assures the generation and exposure of highly active and stable iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while facilitating the reduction of both mass transport loss and electronic resistance of catalyst layer. As a proof of concept, the membrane electrode assembly in single&#8208;cell PEMWE based on honeycomb&#8208;structured IrOx foam platelets, with a low iridium loading (~0.3 mgIr/cm2), is demonstrated to exhibit high catalytic activity at ampere&#8208;level current densities and to remain stable for more than 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>A Green and Efficient Electrocatalytic Route for the Highly&#8208;Selective Oxidation of C&#8722;H Bonds in Aromatics over 1D Co3O4&#8208;Based Nanoarrays</title>

The oxidation selectivities of target products can be manipulated via surface and interface engineering of Co3O4&#8208;based nanocatalysts. The selectivity toward benzaldehyde is achieved to 90&#8201;% at a 47.6&#8201;% conversion of toluene on Co3O4 NNs/Ti. In contrast, the selectivity switching to benzyl alcohol reaches 90.1&#8201;% at a 32.1&#8201;% conversion on Co3O4@MnO2/Ti, demonstrating that electrocatalytic oxidation process is readily maneuvered.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons represents an efficient and sustainable strategy for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Herein, a highly selective and continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical oxidation process of toluene to various oxygenated products (benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzyl acetate) is developed with the electrocatalytic membrane electrodes (ECMEs). The selectivity of target products can be manipulated via surface and interface engineering of Co3O4&#8208;based electrocatalysts. We achieved a high benzaldehyde selectivity of 90&#8201;% at a toluene conversion of 47.6&#8201;% using 1D Co3O4 nanoneedles (NNs) loaded on a microfiltration (MF) titanium (Ti) membrane, i.e, Co3O4 NNs/Ti. In contrast, the main product shifted to benzyl alcohol with a selectivity of 90.1&#8201;% at a conversion of 32.1&#8201;% after modifying MnO2 nanosheets (NSs) on Co3O4 NNs/Ti (Co3O4@MnO2/Ti) catalyst. Moreover, benzyl acetate product can be obtained with a selectivity of 92&#8201;% at a conversion of 58.5&#8201;% at high current density (&gt;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating that the pathway of toluene oxidation is readily maneuvered. DFT results reveal that modifying MnO2 on Co3O4 optimizes the electron structure of Co3O4@MnO2/Ti and modulates the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. This work demonstrates a sustainable, efficient, and continuous&#8208;flow process for precise control over the production selectivity of value&#8208;added oxygenated derivatives in the electrochemical oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons.

In contrast, the main product shifted to benzyl alcohol with a selectivity of 90.1&#8201;% at a conversion of 32.1&#8201;% after modifying MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets (NSs) on Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NNs/Ti (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti) catalyst. Moreover, benzyl acetate product can be obtained with a selectivity of 92&#8201;% at a conversion of 58.5&#8201;% at high current density (&amp;gt;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), demonstrating that the pathway of toluene oxidation is readily maneuvered. DFT results reveal that modifying MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; optimizes the electron structure of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti and modulates the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. This work demonstrates a sustainable, efficient, and continuous-flow process for precise control over the production selectivity of value-added oxygenated derivatives in the electrochemical oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Complementary Electrochromic Batteries using Nb18W16O93 by the Synergistic Effects of Aqueous Al3+/K+ Dual&#8208;Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous electrolytes containing multivalent ions have been studied extensively in post&#8208;lithium electrochromisms. This work proposes that the Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase Nb18W16O93 achieves a reversible Al3+ intercalation/extraction. Electrochromic energy storage devices based on Nb18W16O93 with Prussian blue using a hybrid Al3+/K+ aqueous electrolyte show fast response and large coloring efficiency due to the synergistic effect of Al3+ and K+.







Abstract
Multivalent ions, especially Al3+ in aqueous electrolyte contributes to higher capacity and color contrast for more sustainable post&#8208;lithium electrochromism and energy storages. However, the lack of suitable cathodic and anodic electrochromic materials is a major challenge for Al&#8208;ion electrochromic batteries, which limits their optical contrast and lifespan. Herein, we report that Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase Nb18W16O93 with open structure achieves Al3+ intercalation/extraction reversibly. The complementary electrochromic energy storage devices based on Nb18W16O93 coupled with Prussian blue using hybrid Al3+/K+ aqueous electrolytes show a fast response, a high capacity and a large coloring efficiency. The superior performances are due to the cations of Al3+ and K+ selectively insert/extract in the electrode of Nb18W16O93 and Prussian blue, respectively. This work provides an effective strategy for high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrochromic batteries with higher sustainability.

         <title>Mechanochemical Thioglycolate Modification of Microscale Zero&#8208;Valent Iron for Superior Heavy Metal Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dry mechanochemical process can construct more robust covalent bonding between TG and the inert oxide shell of mZVI through its electron&#8208;withdrawing carboxylate group to accelerate the electron release from the iron core, and more effectively strengthen the surface heavy metal adsorption through metal(d)&#8208;sulfur(p) orbital hybridization between its thiol group and heavy metal ions.







Abstract
Microscale zero&#8208;valent iron (mZVI) is widely used for water pollutant control and environmental remediation, yet its reactivity is still constrained by the inert oxide shell. Herein, we demonstrate that mechanochemical thioglycolate (TG) modification can dramatically enhance heavy metal (NiII, CrVI, CdII, PbII, HgII, and SbIII) removal rates of mZVI by times of 16.7 to 88.0. Compared with conventional impregnation (wet chemical process), this dry mechanochemical process could construct more robust covalent bonding between TG and the inert oxide shell of mZVI through its electron&#8208;withdrawing carboxylate group to accelerate the electron release from the iron core, and more effectively strengthen the surface heavy metal adsorption through metal(d)&#8208;sulfur(p) orbital hybridization between its thiol group and heavy metal ions. Impressively, this mechanochemically TG&#8208;modified mZVI exhibited an unprecedented NiII removal capacity of 580.4&#8197;mg&#8201;Ni&#8201;g&#8722;1 Fe, 17.1 and 9.5&#8197;times those of mZVI and wet chemically TG&#8208;modified mZVI, respectively. Its application potential was further validated by more than 10&#8197;days of stable groundwater NiII removal in a column flow reactor. This study offers a promising strategy to enhance the reactivity of mZVI, and also emphasizes the importance of the modification strategy in optimizing its performance for environmental applications.

         <title>Highly Solvating Electrolytes with Core&#8208;Shell Solvation Structure for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell solvation structured electrolyte, with phosphoramide confined in the first solvation shell via hydrogen bonding, inhibits the contact reaction with Li metal, and stabilizes the [S3]&#8901;&#8722; radical thus promoting a rapid solution&#8208;mediated sulfur reaction pathway and achieving high sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte condition. The 2.71&#8208;Ah pouch cell achieves high specific energy of 307&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and shows stable cycling over 20 cycles.







Abstract
The practical energy density of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is limited by the low sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte conditions. The highly solvating electrolytes (HSEs) promise to address the issue at harsh conditions, but the conflicting challenges of long&#8208;term stability of radical&#8208;mediated sulfur redox reactions (SRR) and the poor stability with lithium metal anode (LMA) have dimmed the efforts. We now present a unique core&#8211;shell solvation structured HSE formulated with classical ether&#8208;based solvents and phosphoramide co&#8208;solvent. The unique core&#8211;shell solvation structure features confinement of the phosphoramide in the first solvation shell, which prohibits severe contact reactions with LMA and endows prolonged stability for [S3]&#8901;&#8722; radical, favoring a rapid radical&#8208;mediated solution&#8208;based SRR. The cell with the proposed electrolyte showing a high capacity of 864&#8197;mAh&#8201;gsulfur&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading of 5.5&#8197;mgsulfur&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 4&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgsulfur&#8722;1. The strategy further enables steady cycling of a 2.71&#8208;A h pouch cell with a high specific energy of 307&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our work highlights the fundamental chemical concept of tuning the solvation structure to simultaneously tame the SRR and LMA stability for metal&#8208;sulfur batteries wherein the electrode reactions are heavily coupled with electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Inverse Design of Singlet&#8208;Fission Materials with Uncertainty&#8208;Controlled Genetic Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncover candidates for singlet fission using a machine learning&#8208;driven uncertainty&#8208;controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA), which is run either in an exploitative or explorative manner. Leveraging a fragment database (reFORMED) derived from crystal structure data, we propose a class of heteroatom&#8208;rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge&#8208;transfer mediated singlet fission.







Abstract
Singlet fission has shown potential for boosting the efficiency of solar cells, but the scarcity of suitable molecular materials hinders its implementation.

&lt;p&gt;We uncover candidates for singlet fission using a machine learning-driven uncertainty-controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA), which is run either in an exploitative or explorative manner. Leveraging a fragment database (reFORMED) derived from crystal structure data, we propose a class of heteroatom-rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge-transfer mediated singlet fission.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singlet fission has shown potential for boosting the efficiency of solar cells, but the scarcity of suitable molecular materials hinders its implementation. We introduce an uncertainty-controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository. Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes.

We suggest a class of heteroatom-rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge-transfer mediated singlet fission.

         <title>Carbodicarbene&#8208;Stibenium Ion&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp)&#8722;H Bonds</title>

A Lewis acidic carbodicarbene&#8208;stibenium ion mediates C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp)&#8722;H bond breaking of acetonitrile and terminal alkynes in the presence of an organic base. The resulting adducts were reacted with elemental iodine to functionalize these C&#8722;H bonds in stoichiometric fashion.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group element&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation remains experimentally challenging and the development of clear concepts and design principles has been limited by the increased reactivity of relevant complexes, especially for the heavier elements. Herein, we report that the stibenium ion [(pyCDC)Sb][NTf2]3 (1) (pyCDC=bis&#8208;pyridyl carbodicarbene; NTf2=bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) reacts with acetonitrile in the presence of the base 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp3)&#8722;H bond breaking to generate the stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile complex [(pyCDC)Sb(CH2CN)][NTf2]2 (2). Kinetic analyses were performed to elucidate the rate dependence for all the substrates involved in the reaction. Computational studies suggest that C&#8722;H activation proceeds via a mechanism in which acetonitrile first coordinates to the Sb center through the nitrogen atom in a &#954;1 fashion, thereby weakening the C&#8722;H bond which can then be deprotonated by base in solution. Further, we show that 1 reacts with terminal alkynes in the presence of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to enable C(sp)&#8722;H bond breaking to form stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts of the type [(pyCDC)Sb(CCR)][NTf2]2 (3&#8201;a&#8211;f). Compound 1 shows excellent specificity for the activation of the terminal C(sp)&#8722;H bond even across alkynes with diverse functionality. The resulting stiba&#8208;methylene nitrile and stiba&#8208;alkynyl adducts react with elemental iodine (I2) to produce iodoacetonitrile and iodoalkynes, while regenerating an Sb trication.

         <title>Integrated Design of Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Copper Complex Catalysts to Enable Synergistic Effects on Sulfur and Lithium Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;ETL&#8208;INT system involving homogeneous Cu&#8208;ETL and heterogeneous Cu&#8208;INT realizes the higher activity for manipulating the Li2S nucleation/decomposition, and lithium plating/stripping behaviors, endowing Li&#8722;S batteries with an outstanding capacity retention of 85.6&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;C after 500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Fatal polysulfide shuttling, sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and detrimental lithium dendrites have curtailed the real discharge capacity, working lifespan and safety of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Organic small molecule promotors as one type of emerging active catalysts can fulfil the management of the electrochemical species evolution behaviors. Herein, an integrated engineering is organized by synthesizing dual chlorine&#8208;bridge enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu2(phen)2Cl2) and its derivative generated in electrolyte (Cu&#8208;ETL) as the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst, respectively. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;ETL with a optimized concentration of 0.25&#8197;wt% as a homogeneous enabler offers highly utilized Cu centers and the sufficient interface contact for guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions. The Cu2(phen)2Cl2 loaded on carbon spheres as an interlayer (Cu&#8208;INT) can break through the catalytic limitation resulting from the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;ETL and thus offers an extended manipulation effect. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the Li&#8722;S battery shows stable cycling at 3&#8197;C upon 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity degradation rate as low as 0.029&#8201;% per cycle. Of specific note, an actual cell energy density of 372.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 is harvested by a 1.2&#8197;Ah&#8208;level soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell, implying a chance for requiring the demand of high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>Achieving Sub&#8208;ppm Sensitivity in SO2 Detection with a Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the first experimental exploration of COFs for SO2 detection. The imine&#8208;functionalized COF exhibited reversible SO2 sorption with over 50 cycles of reversibility. The isosteric enthalpy of adsorption was measured at &#8722;42.3&#8197;kJ/mol, reflecting a strong SO2&#8208;COF interaction. Molecular dynamics and M&#248;ller&#8211;Plesset calculations elucidated the interaction mechanisms, underscoring the COF&#8242;s potential for selective sub&#8208;ppm SO2 sensing.







Abstract
We report the inaugural experimental investigation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to address the formidable challenge of SO2 detection. Specifically, an imine&#8208;functionalized COF (SonoCOF&#8208;9) demonstrated a modest and reversible SO2 sorption of 3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K. At 0.1&#8197;bar (and 298&#8197;K), the total SO2 uptake reached 0.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent reversibility for at least 50 adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. An isosteric enthalpy of adsorption (&#916;Hads) for SO2 equaled &#8722;42.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, indicating a relatively strong interaction of SO2 molecules with the COF material. Also, molecular dynamics simulations and M&#248;ller&#8211;Plesset perturbation theory calculations showed the interaction of SO2 with &#960; density of the rings and lone pairs of the N atoms of SonoCOF&#8208;9. The combination of experimental data and theoretical calculations corroborated the potential use of this COF for the selective detection and sensing of SO2 at the sub&#8208;ppm level (0.0064&#8197;ppm of SO2).

         <title>Multiple Resonance Quasi&#8208;fluorescence from BN&#8208;Doped Aromatic Compounds Modified with &#8220;Naphthalene&#8221; Units Approaches the BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>

By introducing a prototypical &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon unit, specifically the naphthalene unit, into the structure of a classical blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting molecular framework, we can enhance the bonding properties of the target green emitters to meet the BT.2020 standard without sacrificing their optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Developing fluorophores that conform to the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT.2020) standard presents a formidable challenge. Here, we propose an innovative approach that integrates two and three&#8208;boron/nitrogen (BN2)&#8208;embedded [4]helicene subunits with naphthalene, resulting in the synthesis of two novel narrowband bright green quasi&#8208;fluorescent emitters, NT&#8208;2B and NT&#8208;3B for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. These emitters exhibit minimal reorganization energy and Huang&#8211;Rhys factor, emitting at 510 and 511&#8197;nm in dilute toluene solution with exceptionally narrow full width at half maximum values of 15 and 14&#8197;nm, respectively. Notably, NT&#8208;2B demonstrates an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.5&#8201;%, rapid radiative decay rate, and slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate. Owing to their narrowband emission characteristics and outstanding optoelectronic properties, corresponding OLEDs based on NT&#8208;2B demonstrate a high external quantum efficiency of 30.6&#8201;%, with an FWHM value of 21.5&#8197;nm and a CIEy of 0.74, positioning it as one of the leading narrow&#8208;band green emitters.

         <dc:description>
Here we report reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analogs that enable metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free decarboxylative functionalization of RAEs under ambient and open&#8208;air conditions. This approach offers simple operation without inert gas protection, metals and light, rapid reaction completion within 5 minutes from the easily preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates, diverse bond formation (C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;SCF3, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;CN bonds), broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), and synthetic utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization, making this strategy complement classical decarboxylative strategies.







Abstract
Here we report a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free decarboxylative functionalization approach enabled by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analogues. The efficient and operationally simple approach, conducted in 5 minutes from in situ preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates under open&#8208;air and ambient conditions, enables diverse bond formation and exhibits a broad substrate scope of over 70 examples. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and natural products further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this method. Combined experimental and computational studies elucidate the mechanistic pathway. These transformations streamline the synthesis of sp3 carbon&#8208;enriched compounds, adding a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.

         <title>Oxyanions Enhancing Crystallinity of Reconstructed Phase for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero oxyanion was proposed to enhance the crystallinity and activity of reconstructed phase in operation. Taking an amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction of Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O as model, in situ NO3&#8722; leaching and reabsorbing lower the disorder degree and activate Fe (Ni) ion of renewed a&#8208;c heterojunctions, achieving the compatibility of activity and stability for OER.







Abstract
The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3&#8722; to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction. Taking a&#8208;c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (Ni&#8722;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3&#8722; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a&#8208;c Fe(Ni)OOHduring OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a&#8208;c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8722;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303&#8197;mV and high durability of 500&#8197;hours at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100&#8197;hours under a high operating current of 8000&#8197;mA.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pairing Chromonic Liquid Crystals via Alternately Stacked Assembly of Amphiphilic Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;pairing assemblies of an amphiphilic porphyrin AuIII complex bearing hydrophilic triethylene glycol groups exhibited the effects of counteranions and solvation at the side chains on the assembly modes. The ion pair with a &#960;&#8208;electronic anion formed charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge&#8208;based thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals and the single&#8208;stranded polymer structure via i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions.







Abstract
In this study, a new assembly strategy for lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) is proposed using i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions, mainly comprising electrostatic and dispersion forces, between charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems to form stacking structures supported by the hydration of triethylene glycol (TEG) units. The meso&#8208;TEG&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted porphyrin AuIII complex, an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;electronic cation, showed diverse states and assembly modes in ion pairs depending on the coexisting counteranions. The PCCp&#8722; ion pair formed a hexagonal columnar (Colh) LC phase based on a charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assembly, suggesting the formation of an ordered arrangement of charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions, with reduced interactions between the TEG chains. Furthermore, in the presence of water, LCLC behavior in the Colh and nematic columnar phases according to the amount of water were observed for the PCCp&#8722; ion pair as a result of i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced orientation of the charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge columnar structures upon dehydration was observed. Furthermore, single&#8208;stranded charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge columnar structures, as components of the LCLCs, were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

         <title>Location&#8208;Specific Microenvironment Modulation Around Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

Single Cu atoms are precisely anchored to Zr&#8208;oxo clusters in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with different &#8208;X (X=&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2) groups on the linkers. This creates ideal platforms of catalytic Cu sites surrounding with location&#8208;specific microenvironment of &#8208;X groups that play critical roles in regulating the Cu electronic structures, resulting in improved activity in the hydroboration of phenylacetylene.







Abstract
Despite coordination environment of catalytic metal sites has been recognized to be of great importance in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), a significant challenge remains in the understanding how the location&#8208;specific microenvironment in the higher coordination sphere influences their catalysis. Herein, a series of Cu&#8208;based SACs, namely Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X=&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2), are successfully constructed by anchoring single Cu atoms onto the Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X. The &#8208;X functional groups dangling on the MOF linkers could be regarded as location&#8208;specific remote microenvironment to regulate electronic properties of the single Cu atoms. Remarkably, they exhibit significant differences in the catalysis toward the hydroboration of alkynes. The activity follows the order of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 &gt; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66 &gt; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under identical reaction conditions, where Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 showcases the phenylacetylene conversion of 92&#8201;%, ~3.5 times higher efficiency than that of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Experimental and calculation results jointly support that the Cu electronic structure is modulated by the location&#8208;specific microenvironment, thereby regulating the product desorption and promoting the catalysis.

         <title>The First&#8208;In&#8208;Class Deubiquitinase&#8208;Targeting Chimera Stabilizes and Activates cGAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;in&#8208;class deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimeras (DUBTACs) of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING innate immunity pathway, were discovered. These DUBTACs, which not only stabilized cGAS but also activated the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;IRF3 pathway, were generated by exploiting an improved small&#8208;molecule ligand of the deubiquitinase OTUB1. It has also been demonstrated that this improved OTUB1 ligand can lead to highly effective DUBTACs.







Abstract
Deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimera (DUBTAC) is a promising technology for inducing targeted protein stabilization (TPS). Despite its therapeutic potential, very few proteins have been stabilized by DUBTACs to date. The limited applicability of this technology is likely due to the modest DUBTAC&#8208;induced protein stabilization effect, and the scarcity of effective deubiquitinase ligands that can be harnessed for DUBTAC development. Here, we report the discovery of MS7829 and MS8588, the first&#8208;in&#8208;class DUBTACs of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. While these DUBTACs are based on a cGAS inhibitor, they effectively stabilized cGAS and activated the cGAS/STING/IRF3 signaling. To develop these cGAS DUBTACs, we optimized EN523, an OTUB1 covalent ligand, into an improved ligand, MS5105. We validated MS5105 by generating a MS5105&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC, which was approximately 10&#8208;fold more effective in stabilizing the &#916;F508&#8208;CFTR mutant protein than the previously reported EN523&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC. Overall, this work advances the DUBTAC technology for TPS.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Asymmetric Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling has been successfully developed, not only enabling the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriching the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
As a novel type of macrocycles with attractive planar chirality, pillar[5]arenes have gained increasing research interest over the past decades, enabling their widespread applications in diverse fields such as porous materials, molecular machines, and chiral luminescence materials. However, the catalytic methodology towards the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes remains elusive. Here we report a novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling, giving access to a wide range of highly functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, including both homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;rimmed ones, with excellent enantioselectivities. Attractively, the resultant planar chiral pillar[5]arenes show great potential for widespread use in many areas such as chiral luminescent materials. This work not only enables the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriches the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>A Tandem Catalysis for Isoindolinone Synthesis over Single&#8208;Atom Pd/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel tandem catalysis for synthesizing the isoindolinone (IIO) over a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst. The TiO2 efficiently converts phthalic anhydride (PA) with ammonia and the spillover hydrogen species activated over single&#8208;atom Pd to form IIO. Notably, NH3 serves as not only a reactant but also could accelerate the reduction of amide intermediate through the formation of a key intermediate 3&#8208;aminoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one (NH2&#8208;IIO).







Abstract
Developing an efficient strategy to replace the conventional synthesis method for producing isoindolinone (IIO) scaffold, a crucial structural motif for constructing pharmaceutical molecules, remains to be a great challenge. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 tandem catalysis has been developed for the IIO scaffold synthesis by using readily available phthalic anhydride (PA), ammonia, and H2. The single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving a PA conversion of 99&#8201;%, an IIO selectivity of 91&#8201;%, and a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 4807&#8197;h&#8722;1. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the tandem catalysis between TiO2 support and single&#8208;atom Pd. The TiO2 efficiently catalyzes the conversion of PA with ammonia to form phthalimide (PAM), subsequently transformed into IIO over TiO2 through the reaction of PAM with NH3 and the spillover hydrogen species derived from single&#8208;atom Pd. Notably, NH3 functions not only as a reactant but also as a promoter to accelerate the reduction of amides combined with the Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This tandem catalysis of a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of the crucial IIO platform molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polycondensation Flux Synthesis of Ultrastable Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;polycondensation flux synthesis method is developed to produce a series of olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystalline, porosity and stability. The COFs loading Pd nanoparticles show high NH3 production yields and faradaic efficiency, the best comprehensive performance among all reported COFs.







Abstract
Creating new functional materials that efficiently support noble metal catalysts is important and in high demand. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;polycondensation flux synthesis strategy that can produce olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platforms with high crystallinity and porosity as the supports of Pd nanoparticles for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). A series of &#8220;two in one&#8221; monomers integrating aldehyde and methyl reactive groups are rationally designed to afford COFs with square&#8208;shaped pores and ultrahigh chemical stability (e.g., strong acid or alkali environments for &gt;1&#8197;month). Functionalizing Fluorine significantly boosts the hydrophobicity of fluoro&#8208;functionalized COFs, which can inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhance ENRR performances. The COFs loading Pd nanoparticles show high NH3 production yields up to 90.0&#177;2.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and the faradaic efficiency of 44&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the best comprehensive performance among all reported COFs. Meanwhile, the catalysts are easy to recover and recycle, as demonstrated by their use for 15&#8197;cycles and 17&#8197;hours, with good performance retention. This work not only provides a new synthesis strategy for olefin&#8208;linked COFs, but also paves a new avenue for the design of highly efficient ENRR catalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Anode and Cathode Interphases via an Alum Electrolyte Additive for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work suggests that the addition of KAl(SO4)2 induces the competitive solvation effect and forms an in situ Zn&#8722;Al alloy layer that synergistically protects the Zn anode, while the formation of an Al&#8208;containing CEI layer at the cathode inhibits the dissolution of VOx. Consequently, the Zn||VO2 full cell in the ZS&#8208;KASO electrolyte shows excellent cycling stability even at a low N/P ratio of 2.83 and high mass loading (~16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
A zinc (Zn) metal anode paired with a vanadium oxide (VOx) cathode is a promising system for aqueous Zn&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs); however, side reactions proliferating on the Zn anode surface and the infinite dissolution of the VOx cathode destabilise the battery system. Here, we introduce a multi&#8208;functional additive into the ZnSO4 (ZS) electrolyte, KAl(SO4)2 (KASO), to synchronise the in situ construction of the protective layer on the surface of the Zn anode and the VOx cathode. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron radiation have verified that the high&#8208;valence Al3+ plays dual roles of competing with Zn2+ for solvation and forming a Zn&#8722;Al alloy layer with a homogeneous electric field on the anode surface to mitigate the side reactions and dendrite generation. The Al&#8208;containing cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface (CEI) considerably alleviates the irreversible dissolution of the VOx cathode and the accumulation of byproducts. Consequently, the Zn||Zn cell with KASO exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle of 6000&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the VOx cathodes (VO2, V2O5 and NH4V4O10) in the ZS&#8722;KASO electrolyte showed excellent cycling stability, including Zn powder||VO2 cells and Zn||VO2 pouch cells. Even better, the full cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2.83 and high mass loading (~16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This study offers a straightforward and practical reference for concurrently addressing challenges at the anode and cathode of AZIBs.

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts through Pre&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Directed in Situ Confinement for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genergl pre&#8208;coordination strategy is proposed to precisily synthesize the dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs), ranging from heteronuclear to homonuclear bimetallic pairs. Moreover, the pre&#8208;coordination strategy synthesized DSACs shows significant CO2 reduction reaction performance in both flow&#8208;cell and practical rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 batteries.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) are the next paradigm shift in single&#8208;atom catalysts because of the enhanced performance brought about by the synergistic effects between adjacent bimetallic pairs. However, there are few methods for synthesizing DSACs with precise bimetallic structures. Herein, a pre&#8208;coordination strategy is proposed to precisely synthesize a library of DSACs. This strategy ensures the selective and effective coordination of two metals via phthalocyanines with specific coordination sites, such as &#8722;F&#8722; and &#8722;OH&#8722;. Subsequently, in situ confinement inhibits the migration of metal pairs during high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, and obtains the DSACs with precisely constructed metal pairs. Despite changing synthetic parameters, including transition metal centers, metal pairs, and spatial geometry, the products exhibit similar atomic metal pairs dispersion properties, demonstrating the universality of the strategy. The pre&#8208;coordination strategy synthesized DSACs shows significant CO2 reduction reaction performance in both flow&#8208;cell and practical rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 batteries. This work not only provides new insights into the precise synthesis of DSACs, but also offers guidelines for the accelerated discovery of efficient catalysts.

         <title>Fighting Mutations with Mutations: Evolutionarily Adapting a DNA Aptamer for High&#8208;Affinity Recognition of Mutated Spike Proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBA5SA1, a new DNA aptamer with picomolar affinity to the spike protein of diverse Omicron subvariants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, is derived by in vitro selection for the recognition of the spike protein of BA.5 from a mutational library built on the scaffold of MSA52, an aptamer originally developed to recognize the spike protein of the wild&#8208;type virus. MBA5SA1&#8217;s affinity to the Omicron spike protein is &gt;100&#8208;fold higher than MSA52 and has set up a more reliable and sensitive clinical diagnostic tool for the Omicron variants.







Abstract
An on&#8208;going challenge with COVID&#8208;19, which has huge implications for future pandemics, is the rapid emergence of viral variants that makes diagnostic tools less accurate, calling for rapid identification of recognition elements for detecting new variants caused by mutations. We hypothesize that we can fight mutations of the viruses with mutations of existing recognition elements. We demonstrate this concept via rapidly evolving an existing DNA aptamer originally selected for the spike protein (S&#8208;protein) of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to enhance the interaction with the same protein of the Omicron variants. The new aptamer, MBA5SA1, has acquired 22 mutations within its 40&#8208;nucleotide core sequence and improved its binding affinity for the S&#8208;proteins of diverse Omicron subvariants by &gt;100&#8208;fold compared to its parental aptamer (improved from nanomolar to picomolar affinity). Deep sequencing analysis reveals dynamic competitions among several MBA5SA1 variants in response to increasing selection pressure imposed during in vitro selection, with MBA5SA1 being the final winner of the competition. Additionally, MBA5SA1 was implemented into an enzyme&#8208;linked aptamer binding assay (ELABA), which was applied for detecting Omicron variants in the saliva of infected patients. The assay produced a sensitivity of 86.5&#8201;% and a specificity of 100&#8201;%, which were established with 83 clinical samples.

         <title>A Crystalline Mesoionic Diazasilole Featuring Low&#8208;Valent Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of a mesoionic diazasilole featuring a low&#8208;valent silicon center that exhibits properties characteristic of both mesoionic silylene and silylone. Preliminary reactivity studies, including coordination with transition metals, oxidation, silicon atom transfer, ring saturation, ring contraction, and skeletal rearrangement, have yielded an array of novel silicon&#8208;based heterocycles.







Abstract
A 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole containing a low&#8208;valent silicon atom has been synthesized employing a bulky imino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. This molecular structure is characterized by a mesoionic C2N2Si five&#8208;membered ring, notable for its delocalized &#960; electrons, intrinsic charge&#8208;separated zwitterionic properties, and a distinctly nucleophilic silicon center, culminating in 6&#960; aromaticity. This compound manifests either mesoionic silylene or silylone characteristics upon coordination with transition metals. Demonstrating extraordinary versatility, this compound engages in diverse reactions such as coordination with iron or iridium, oxidation by S8, intramolecular ring saturation under the coordination influence of iridium, silicon atom transfer facilitated by Ph2Se2, ring contraction induced by Ph2Te2, and skeletal rearrangement triggered by Et3N&#8226;HCl. These reactions culminate in the formation of a variety of unprecedented silicon&#8208;based heterocycles, which are typically formidable to achieve using conventional methods. This study unveils previously unexplored facets of low&#8208;valent 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole, positioning it as a promising foundational building block for future innovations in unique silicon compounds.

         <title>Bimetallic Cu11Ag3 Nanotips for Ultrahigh Yield Rate of Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment and tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment effect is designed for efficient electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia in wide NO3&#8722; concentrations ranging from 15 to 1800&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1, delivering an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.33&#8197;V vs. RHE and a high FE of 98.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NRA) offers a sustainable approach for NH3 production and NO3&#8722; removal but suffers from low NH3 yield rate (&lt;1.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We present bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment, which achieve an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.33&#8197;V vs. RHE, a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term operation stability at 1800&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;, outperforming most of the recently reported catalysts. At a NO3&#8722; concentration as low as 15&#8197;mg&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1, it still delivers a high FE of 86.9&#8201;% and an NH3 selectivity of 93.8&#8201;%. Finite&#8208;element method and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu11Ag3 exhibits reduced adsorption energy barrier of *N intermediates, favorable water dissociation for *H generation and high energy barrier for H2 formation, while its tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment promoting NO3&#8722; accumulation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Antibody&#8208;Oligonucleotide Conjugates for Targeted Delivery of Complementary Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular Antibody&#8208;Oligonucleotide Conjugate (MAOC) is formed with self&#8208;assembling modules each comprising a L&#8211;DNA designed to base&#8208;pair with other L&#8211;DNAs, and either single&#8208;domain antibody (sdAb) for receptor binding or ASO for mRNA targeting. The self&#8208;assembled MAOC can efficiently deliver different ASOs into the same cells via transferrin receptor (TfR1) mediated internalization for multiple exon skipping of the dystrophin gene.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugate (AOC) affords preferential cell targeting and enhanced cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Here, we have developed a modular AOC (MAOC) approach based on accurate self&#8208;assembly of separately prepared antibody and ASO modules. Homogeneous multimeric AOC with defined ASO&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio were generated by L&#8211;DNA scaffold mediated precise self&#8208;assembly of antibodies and ASOs. The MAOC approach has been implemented to deliver exon skipping ASOs via transferrin receptor (TfR1) mediated internalization. We discovered an anti&#8208;TfR1 sdAb that can greatly enhance nuclear delivery of ASOs. Cryo&#8208;EM structure of the sdAb&#8208;TfR1 complex showed a new epitope that does not overlap with the binding sites of endogenous TfR1 ligands. In vivo functional analyses of MAOCs with one ASO for single exon skipping and two ASOs for double exon skipping showed that both ASO concentration and exon skipping efficacy of MAOC in cardiac and skeletal muscles are dramatically higher than conventional ASOs in the transgenic human TfR1 mouse model. MAOC treatment was well tolerated in vivo and not associated with any toxicity&#8208;related morbidity or mortality. Collectively, our data suggest that the self&#8208;assembled MAOC is a viable option for broadening the therapeutic application of ASO via multi&#8208;specific targeting and delivery.

         <title>Prompting CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol by Iron Group Metal Ion Dopants Induced Multi&#8208;sites at the Interface of SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8211;n Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to ethanol is achieved via iron group metal ions doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2 nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structure. Iron group metal ions doping stabilizes *CO*OH intermediate and strengthens *CO binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2.







Abstract
The development of non&#8208;copper&#8208;based materials for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high selectivity at large current density is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, we report iron group metal ions of M2+ (M=Fe, Co, or Ni)&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2 nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structures (a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2) for selective CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. Iron group metal ions doping induces multiple active sites at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8208;n heterojunction, which strengthens *CO intermediate binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation. As a representative, Fe9.0%&#8208;a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2 exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 62.7&#8201;% and a partial current density of 239.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V in a flow cell. Moreover, it can output an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 63.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 201.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 24.1&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;V in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work provides insight into non&#8208;Cu based catalyst design for stabilizing the key intermediates for selective ethanol production from CO2 electroreduction.

As a representative, Fe&lt;sub&gt;9.0%&lt;/sub&gt;-a/c-SnSe/SnSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 62.7&#8201;% and a partial current density of 239.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V in a flow cell. Moreover, it can output an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 63.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 201.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a full-cell energy efficiency of 24.1&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;V in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work provides insight into non-Cu based catalyst design for stabilizing the key intermediates for selective ethanol production from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving the Selectivity and Stability of Supported Cobalt Catalysts via Static Bi&#8208;Doping and Dynamic Trace CO2 Co&#8208;Feeding During Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed a strategy combining static and dynamic combination strategy to enhance both product selectivity and catalyst stability during propane dehydrogenation. Static Bi doping facilitates electron transfer from Bi to Co, promoting C3H8 conversion to C3H6 and mitigating undesired side reactions. CO2 acts as a dynamic decarburizing agent that efficiently inhibits coking while prolonging catalyst lifespan.







Abstract
Simultaneously enhancing selectivity and stability on supported propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a combined static and dynamic strategy to address these issues synergistically. Firstly, we demonstrate a feasible sol&#8208;gel method for preparing atomically&#8208;dispersed Bi&#8208;decorated metal nanoparticle catalysts (MBi/Al2O3, M=Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn). In PDH testing, the total selectivity of by&#8208;products (CH4 and C2H6) significantly decreases to 4&#8201;% for CoBi catalysts due to the static Bi&#8208;doping, compared with 16&#8201;% for Co&#8208;supported catalysts. Secondly, to enhance catalytic stability, we introduce a dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding route. 10CoBi/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit superior durability against coke formation for 330&#8197;hours in PDH under a 40&#8201;% C3H8 atmosphere followed by pure C3H8 conditions at 600&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining propylene selectivity at 96&#8201;%. Notably, introducing trace CO2 leads to a remarkable 6&#8208;fold decrease in the deactivation rate constant (kd). Multiple characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that charge transfer from atomically&#8208;distributed Bi to Co nanoparticles benefits lowering the energy of C3H6 adsorption thereby suppressing by&#8208;products. Furthermore, the dynamic co&#8208;feeding of trace CO2 facilitates coke removal, suppressing catalyst deactivation. The static Bi&#8208;doping and dynamic trace CO2 co&#8208;feeding strategy contributes simultaneously to increased selectivity and stability on supported PDH catalysts.

         <title>Importing Atomic Rare&#8208;Earth Sites to Activate Lattice Oxygen of Spinel Oxides for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 catalyst was constructed to tune the lattice oxygen redox during OER, with catalytic mechanism elucidated. Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) compared to NiCo2O4. Electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox.







Abstract
Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare&#8208;earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution within NiCo2O4. The developed Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as also verified by pH&#8208;dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis. The 18O&#8208;labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry provides direct evidence that the oxygen released during the OER originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8722;NiCo2O4. We discover that electron delocalization of Ce&#8197;4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce&#8722;O&#8722;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8722;O bonding in [Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Ni] unit site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER. This work provides a new perspective for designing highly active spinel oxides for OER and offers significant insights into the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;enhanced LOM mechanism.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nitrides with Visible Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence and Invisible Thermal&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Ultraviolet Delayed Fluorescence for Security Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence, visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli&#8208;production invisible ultraviolet (UV) delayed fluorescence (DF) is discovered by introducing oxygen relevant groups into carbon nitrides. The prepared materials exhibit great potentials in security protections by means of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF with superior concealment.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;mode emissive materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive producing invisible signals are very attractive for advanced security applications, but development of such materials remains highly challenging. In this work, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitrides (O&#8208;CNs) are prepared via microwave&#8208;assisted heating of urea, which exhibit ultraviolet (UV) solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSFL), visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli production of invisible UV delayed fluorescence (DF) properties. Further studies confirmed that the SSFL and RTP could be attributed to the introduction of oxygen functional group (e.&#8201;g., C=O) in the skeleton of O&#8208;CNs, thus minimizing the aggregation caused quenching effect, facilitating intersystem crossing, and stabilizing the excited triplet states. The specific thermal&#8208;stimuli production of UV DF is deemed to be the relatively large energy gap between ground and excited singlet states as well as an effective triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Notably, the emission maximum of UV DF locates at ~310&#8197;nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 19&#8197;nm, so it is completely invisible to the naked eyes, but detectable by a UV camera. To employ the unique characteristics of O&#8208;CNs, security protection strategies with superior concealment by virtue of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF are demonstrated.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

We have synthesized enantiopure o&#8208;quinone functionalized helicene diradicals including dianions and neutral boron&#8208;containing species. Their singlet ground state were confirmed by experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Notably, heteroatom boron&#8208;incorporated helicene not only shows stronger chiroptical responses in near NIR region compared to dianion salts but also displays better thermal stability.







Abstract
Helicene diradical derivatives have attracted widespread attentions because of their unique magnetic and chiroptoelectronic properties, however, crystalline and enantiomerically pure forms of helicene diradicals are extremely rare. Herein, we describe the rational design and synthesis of o&#8208;quinone functionalized helicene diradicals with crystalline enantiomerical purity. Diradical dianion salt Rac&#8208;3K and its enantiomers P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by reduction of corresponding precursors Rac&#8208;3 and P/M&#8208;3 with two equivalent potassium graphite in THF in the presence of (di)benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6. Neutral dioxoborocyclic helicene diradicals (Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3B) were produced by reactions of Rac&#8208;3 or P/M&#8208;3 with chlorobis(perfluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)2Cl. Crystal structures of compounds Rac&#8208;3K, Rac&#8208;3B and P/M&#8208;3K were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Their open&#8208;shell singlet state ground states were confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and theoretical calculations. Their chiroptical properties were investigated by the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. This work provides the first examples of enantiopure helicene diradical dianions and boron&#8208;containing helicene diradicals.

         <title>Dipole Moment Modulation of Terminal Groups Enables Asymmetric Acceptors Featuring Medium Bandgap for Efficient and Stable Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present a novel design of Y&#8208;series acceptors by strategically introducing designed terminal groups that modulate dipole moments and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). By incorporating a methoxy group and a halogen atom at specific positions of the terminal groups results in asymmetric acceptors with attenuated ICT effects and broader band gaps. The optimized ternary devices exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.34&#8201;%.







Abstract
This study puts forth a novel terminal group design to develop medium&#8208;band gap Y&#8208;series acceptors beyond conventional side&#8208;chain engineering. We focused on the strategical integration of an electron&#8208;donating methoxy group and an electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen atom at benzene&#8208;fused terminal groups. This combination precisely modulated the dipole moment and electron density of terminal groups, effectively attenuating intramolecular charge transfer effect, and widening the band gap of acceptors. The incorporation of these terminal groups yielded two asymmetric acceptors, named BTP&#8208;2FClO and BTP&#8208;2FBrO, both of which exhibited open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) as high as 0.96&#8197;V in binary devices, representing the highest VOCs among the asymmetric Y&#8208;series small molecule acceptors. More importantly, both BTP&#8208;2FClO and BTP&#8208;2FBrO exhibit modest aggregation behaviors and molecular crystallinity, making them suitable as a third component to mitigate excess aggregation of the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 blend and optimize the devices&#8217; morphology. As a result, the optimized BTP&#8208;2FClO&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.34&#8201;%, positioning it among the highest&#8208;performing OSCs. Our study highlights the molecular design importance on manipulating dipole moments and electron density in developing medium&#8208;band gap acceptors, and offers a highly efficient third component for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs.

         <title>Unlocking Mechanism of Anion and Cation Interaction on Ion Conduction of Polymer Based Electrolyte in Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing polyesters with different electron withdrawing groups (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to cation is the reason for fast ion conduction of polymer based electrolyte.







Abstract
Polymer based electrolyte shows advantages in compatibly improving safety and interface stability of batteries, while its limited ion conductivity and transfer number make it difficult to apply in batteries with high energy density. Herein, by designing four crosslinking polyesters with different electron withdrawing group (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to Li+ is critical for high Li+ transfer number (

tLi+

 ${t_{Li}^+ }$



) and ionic conductivity of electrolyte. As a result, poly (2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) (PTFM) based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) shows an ionic conductivity of 0.78&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a 

tLi+

 ${{t}_{Li}^{+}}$



 of 0.85, much higher than those of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) without EWG. Moreover, PTFM based GPE shows excellent flame retardancy property. Li||PTFM||NCM811 batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 5.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 show stable cycles of 5&#8197;times to that of Li||PMMA||NCM811. Moreover, the assembled graphite||PTFM||NCM811 pouch cell shows a capacity retention rate of 92&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. This work clarifies the mechanism of cation/anion interaction on ionic conductivity of GPE, which is important to develop high&#8208;performance devices with good safety and flexibility.

         <title>Highly Conductive Alcohol&#8208;Processable n&#8208;Type Conducting Polymer Enabled by Finely Tuned Electrostatic Interactions for Green Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A notable alcohol&#8208;processable n&#8208;type conductive ink was realized through favorable electrostatic interactions between poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOx). Upon annealing, PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films recrystallized and achieved conductivities over 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, the highest for water/alcohol processed n&#8208;type conducting polymers. Various devices using PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx highlighted its broad potential for green organic electronics.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable conducting polymers open up a new era in organic electronics, fundamentally altering the processing methods of electronic devices. P&#8208;type conducting polymers, exemplified by aqueous solution&#8208;processed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS), have been successfully commercialized. However, the performance of electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) materials remains considerably poorer. One of the primary challenges lies in striking a balance between conductivity and solvent processability. At present, most n&#8208;type conducting polymers necessitate toxic solvents for processing, which contradicts environmentally sustainable principles and impedes their potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications. Herein, we developed an alcohol&#8208;processable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conducting polymer, poly(3,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]difuran&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione): poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx), which utilized electrostatic interactions between PEOx and PBFDO to simultaneously achieve high conductivity and alcohol&#8208;processability. The PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films exhibited remarkable electrical conductivity exceeding 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with outstanding stability even at temperatures up to 250&#8201;&#176;C, establishing it as a prominent green solvent&#8208;processed n&#8208;type conducting polymer that rivals the most advanced p&#8208;type counterparts. Various applications including organic thermoelectric, electrochemical transistor, and electrochromic devices were showcased, highlighting the broad potential of PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx in advancing green organic electronics.

Various applications including organic thermoelectric, electrochemical transistor, and electrochromic devices were showcased, highlighting the broad potential of PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx in advancing green organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions Via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for modulating mechanophore reactivity is introduced by employing a cyclic pulling geometry to precisely tailor force transmission. This approach enables the construction of polymer materials with hierarchical mechanochemical responsiveness, advancing the field of polymer mechanochemistry.







Abstract
In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160&#8197;min&#8722;1 to 0.00133&#8197;min&#8722;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis indicates that the split force transmission along ring chains contributes to the significant difference in mechanochemical reactivity. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Strong Magneto&#8208;Chiroptical Effects through Introducing Chiral Transition&#8208;Metal Complex Cations to Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral metal halide based on A&#8208;site chiral complex cation is synthesized, which provides a new strategy to construct the magnetic chiral metal halide. The influence of complex cation on the chiroptical and magnetic properties is systematically investigated. An ultrahigh modulation of over 500&#8201;% of apparent circular dichroism is achieved under 1.3&#8197;T magnetic field. The coupling between magnetic moment and chiroptical activity is confirmed by the magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism.







Abstract
The interplay between chirality with magnetism can break both the space and time inversion symmetry and have wide applications in information storage, photodetectors, multiferroics and spintronics. Herein, we report the chiral transition&#8208;metal complex cation&#8208;based lead halide, R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB. In contrast with the traditional chiral metal halides with organic cations, a novel strategy for chirality transfer from the transition&#8208;metal complex cation to the lead halide framework is developed. The chiral complex cations directly participate the band structure and introduce the d&#8208;d transitions and tunable magneto&#8208;chiroptical effects in both the ultraviolet and full visible range into R&#8208;CDPB and S&#8208;CDPB. Most importantly, the coupling between magnetic moment of the complex cation and chiroptical properties is confirmed by the magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism. For the band&#8208;edge transition, the unprecedented modulation of +514&#8201;% for S&#8208;CDPB and &#8722;474&#8201;% for R&#8208;CDPB was achieved at &#8722;1.3 Tesla. Our findings demonstrate a novel strategy to combine chirality with magnetic moment, and provide a versatile material platform towards magneto&#8208;chiroptical and chiro&#8208;spintronic applications.

         <title>Towards Efficient White&#8208;light Emission in Sulfur Dots through Surface Charge Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 12.1&#8201;% has been achieved in sulfur dots (SDs) for the first time through surface charge engineering. Detailed experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the orbital coupling between sulfur and oleylamine molecules facilitates charge transfer (CT) transitions at the hybrid surface of SDs. This CT interaction complicates the transition dynamics and promotes multi&#8208;energy emission.







Abstract
Sulfur dots (SDs) have emerged as promising photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their intrinsic merits such as abundant electronic effects, outstanding biocompatibility and available photocatalytic activity. Typically based on quantum confinement effects, SDs are reported usually confined emission in blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. However, it is challenging to achieve their broad emission tunability in the visible region, restricted by inherent band gap of bulk sulfur (ca. 2.79&#8197;eV). Herein, we present white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting SDs achieved by surface charge engineering that hybridizes the surface of SDs with oleylamine. The resulting SDs exhibit broadband emissions (full width at half maximum of 187&#8197;nm) with PL quantum yields of up to 12.1&#8201;% and Commission International de I'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.27, 0.32). Detailed experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the strong orbital coupling between oleylamine and sulfur on the hybrid surfaces of the SDs causes electron delocalization, leading to the generation of low&#8208;energy charge transfer (CT) states. These CT states are highly sensitive to sulfur&#8208;oleylamine hybrid structures, which complicate the transition dynamics and promote multi&#8208;energy emissions, accounting for efficient white&#8208;light emission. The demonstration of white&#8208;light SDs based on surface charge engineering is an important step towards the development of sulfur&#8208;based PL materials.

         <title>Robust and Reversible Thermal/Electro&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesives via Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds and Ionic Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal yet synergistic effect of H&#8722;bonding DAP/Thy moieties with poly(ionic liquid)s towards the robust and reversible thermal/electro&#8208;responsive polymeric adhesives has been addressed. The incorporated ionic segments can partly mitigate intermolecular DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding interactions within cohesion network, thereby liberate more free H&#8722;bonds towards the substrate interface, endowing the promoted interfacial adhesion forces.







Abstract
Adhesive conducting elastomers are rising materials towards cutting&#8208;edge applications in wearable and implantable soft electronics. Yet, engineering the conductive adhesives with robust and tunable interfacial bonding strength is still in its infancy stage. We herein identify a structurally novel supramolecular polymer scaffold, characterized by synergistic coexistence of hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8722;bonding) interactions and electrostatic ionic junctions, endowing the robust and tunable elastic conducting adhesives with remarkable thermal/electro&#8208;responsive performance. H&#8722;bonding association and electrostatic interaction play orthogonal yet synergistic roles in the strong supramolecular adhesive formation, serving as the leveraging forces for opposing both cohesion and adhesion energy. To do so, six&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped random copolymers P1, and P2 are strategically designed, bearing H&#8722;bonding PDAP (poly(diaminopyridine acrylamide)) and PThy (poly(thymine)) segments, which can form hetero&#8208;complementary DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding association, along with ionic conductive poly(ionic liquid)s segment: PMBT, (poly(1&#8208;[2&#8208;methacryloylethyl]&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)&#8208;sulfonamide)). DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding association, along with electrostatic ionic interaction, can yield dual supramolecular forces crosslinked polymeric networks with robust cohesion energy. Moreover, coexistence of poly(ionic liquid)s can impact and interfere the configuration of H&#8722;bonding association, liberate more free DAP and Thy motifs to form H&#8722;bonds towards substrate, affording strong surface adhesion in a synergistic manner. This work demonstrates a significant forward step towards potential adhesives devoted to hybrid electronic devices.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Sequence&#8208;Controlled Copolymerization of Lactones: Tailoring Material Properties from Robust Plastics to Tough Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

This study presents a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy for creating block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL). It explores how the distinct kinetics of these monomers, affected by coordinating versus non&#8208;coordinating solvents, lead to tunable copolyester properties, ranging from robust plastics to tough elastomers.







Abstract
Copolymerization stands as a versatile and potent method for tailoring polymer properties by adjusting structural unit composition and sequence distribution. However, achieving sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization in a one&#8208;step and one&#8208;pot process remains challenging. This study introduces a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy to produce block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL). The distinct kinetics of the two monomers enable the facile synthesis of diblock and triblock copolyesters, PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Ph&#8208;BL)&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL), in non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as dichloromethane and toluene. Conversely, coordinating solvents like tetrahydrofuran, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4&#8208;dioxane, and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane facilitate frequent transesterifications, yielding statistical copolyesters P[CL&#8208;stat&#8208;(4Ph&#8208;BL)] with varying ratios of heterosequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that coordinating solvents stabilize the transition state for transesterification, thereby validating their role in triggering this process. By varying the microstructures and compositions, the resultant copolyesters display tunable thermal and mechanical properties, evolving from robust plastics with an ultimate tensile strength of up to 46.3&#177;3.1&#8197;MPa to tough elastomers with &gt;99.3&#8201;% elastic recovery. All the copolyesters exhibit remarkable thermal stability (Td,5%=376&#8201;&#176;C) and maintain desirable chemical circularity (&gt;92&#8201;%), supporting a closed&#8208;loop life cycle for sustainable material economy.

         <title>Piperazine&#8208;Derived Bisphosphonate&#8208;Based Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Bone Microenvironment</title>

Piperazine&#8208;based bisphosphonate&#8208;linked ionizable lipids for enhanced lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the bone microenvironment through systemic administration.







Abstract
Nucleic acid delivery with mRNA lipid nanoparticles are being developed for targeting a wide array of tissues and cell types. However, targeted delivery to the bone microenvironment remains a significant challenge in the field, due in part to low local blood flow and poor interactions between drug carriers and bone material. Here we report bone&#8208;targeting ionizable lipids incorporating a piperazine backbone and bisphosphate moieties, which bind tightly with hydroxyapatite ([Ca5(PO4)3OH]), a key component of mineralized tissues. These lipids demonstrate biocompatibility and low toxicity in both vitro and in vivo studies. LNP formulated with these lipids facilitated efficient cellular transfection and improved binding to hydroxyapatite in vitro, and targeted delivery to the bone microenvironment in vivo following systemic administration. Overall, our findings demonstrate the critical role of the piperazine backbone in a novel ionizable lipid, which incorporates a bisphosphonate group to enable efficient bone&#8208;targeted delivery, highlighting the potential of rational design of ionizable lipids for next&#8208;generation bone&#8208;targeting delivery systems.

         <title>Electrostatically Dominated Pre&#8208;Organization in Cyclodextrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interactions have been found to dominate the pre&#8208;organization of carboxylate anionic guests inside the tunnels of cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These interactions are so strong that they override the influence of all other noncovalent bonding interactions present in the tunnels.







Abstract
Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged entities play a key role in pre&#8208;organizing substrates and stabilizing transition states of reactions in enzymes. The use of electrostatic interactions to pre&#8208;organize ions in nanoconfined pores, however, has not been investigated to its full potential. Herein, we describe how carboxylate anions can be pre&#8208;organized at the behest of their electrostatic interactions with K+ cations in nanoconfined tunnels present in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic frameworks, i.e., CD&#8208;MOFs. Several carboxylate anions, which are all much smaller than the cavities of the tunnels, were visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallography when nanoconfined in CD&#8208;MOFs, despite the large voids present in the tunnels. These anions were found to be aligned within a planar array defined by four K+ cations, positioned around the periphery of the tunnels. The strong electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions and the K+ cations dictate the orientation of the anions and override the influence of all other possible noncovalent bonding interactions between them and the tunnels. Consequently, the aligned pairs of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings constituting the tunnels become distorted, resulting in them having lower symmetry and fewer disordered carboxylate anions in the solid state. Our findings offer a transformative strategy for controlling the packing and orientation of ions in nanoconfined environments.

         <title>A Direct Chemical Repair of Etheno&#8208;Type RNA Damages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study identifies PS9, a synthetic flavin derivative, as the first chemical repair agent for etheno&#8208;type RNA damages. PS9 effectively removes &#1013;A and &#1013;C modifications in RNA via cycloaddition with singlet oxygen under blue light, presenting a novel approach distinct from traditional protein&#8208;mediated repair. This discovery highlights potential applications in understanding RNA damage repair and its implications for RNA biology and therapeutic development.







Abstract
Etheno damages in RNA represent a unique class of structural alterations that arise from exposure to various environmental stressors or endogenous processes. They significantly distort the RNA structure and affect crucial biological functions, including RNA&#8208;protein interactions, ribosome function, and translation fidelity. However, repair mechanisms for those etheno damages in RNA are still being elucidated. Here, a synthetic flavin derivative PS9 has been identified as the first example of chemical repair approach for this type of RNA damages. It efficiently managed the removal of etheno&#8208;type &#1013;A and &#1013;C damages in nucleosides, oligonucleotides in vitro, and in E. coli RNA in vivo under blue light irradiation. The capacity of the chemical approach relies on a unique cycloaddition activation of the etheno&#8208;bridge with singlet oxygen, which is distinct from traditional epoxidation of the C=C double bonds by proteins from the AlkB family. The understanding and effective manipulation of etheno damages in RNA with chemical tools hold implications for deciphering their role in mutagenesis and RNA biology, potentially opening avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions and biomarker development.

         <title>Strengthen Water O&#8722;H Bond in Electrolytes for Enhanced Reversibility and Safety in Aqueous Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>

This study demonstrated that the water activity of AAIBs can be effectively suppressed by elevating the electron density of water protons through interactions with exceptionally polar additives. Simultaneously, this strategic approach alleviates aluminum corrosion in the hybrid electrolyte, widens the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte, and effectively resolves the flammability issue associated with organic additives.







Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries present a promising prospect for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to the abundance, inherent safety, and the high theoretical capacity of aluminum. However, their voltage output and energy density are significantly hindered by challenges such as complex hydrogen evolution and uncontrollable solvation reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that water decomposition is restrain by increasing the electron density of water protons and increasing the dissociation energy of H2O through robust dipole interactions with highly polar dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules. Moreover, the incorporation of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) flame retardant effectively addresses the flammability risk arising from a substantial presence of organic additives The in&#8208;depth study with experimental and theoretical simulations reveals that the water&#8208;poor solvation structure with reduced water activity is achieved, which can (i) effectively mitigate undesired solvated H2O&#8208;mediated side reactions on the Al anode; (ii) boost the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Al3+ while preventing cathode structural distortion; (iii) reduce the flammability of hybrid electrolytes. As a proof of concept, the Al//AlxMnO2 full cell employing a hybrid electrolyte demonstrate enhanced stability (deliver 335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while retaining 71&#8201;% capacity for 400 cycles) compared to those with pure electrolyte.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Valuable para&#8208;Benzoquinone from Aqueous Phenol on NiRu Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

The NiRu hybrid electrocatalyst with enhanced phenol adsorption, increased para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution capabilities, simultaneously achieves excellent phenol abatement and valuable p&#8208;BQ production at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5&#8201;% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.

         <title>Establishing the Comprehensive Structure&#8722;Activity Relationship of the Natural Antibiotic Kibdelomycin/Amycolamicin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through extensive chemical synthesis, the first comprehensive structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis of the potent natural antibiotics kibdelomycin (KBD) and amycolamicin (AMM) was established in this study. A key analog with enhanced antibacterial properties was identified, offering valuable insights for the development of novel antibiotics based on KBD/AMM to combat the pressing global challenge of antimicrobial resistance.







Abstract
Kibdelomycin (KBD) and amycolamicin (AMM) are potent natural antibiotics effective against antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including vancomycin&#8208;intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, VISA), methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and quinolone&#8208;resistant S. aureus (QRSA). Their antibacterial activity stems from an unprecedented dual mechanism: the lower binding sites occupy the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of bacterial type II topoisomerases, while the upper binding sites disrupt the enzyme dimer interface. This dual action, combined with their unique chemical structures, positions KBD and AMM as promising scaffolds for developing new antibiotics. However, the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) of KBD/AMM remains underexplored due to their highly complex chemical structures. In this study, we utilized total synthesis to produce KBD/AMM analogs with various site modifications and evaluated their antimicrobial activities. Our findings establish the first comprehensive SAR for KBD/AMM, paving the way for the development of novel KBD/AMM&#8208;based antibiotics.

         <title>An n&#8208;Doping Cross&#8208;Linkable Quinoidal Compound as an Electron Transport Material for Fully Stretchable Inverted Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linked film, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, based on a quinoidal compound and polyethylenimine has been developed. This film exhibits high electrical conductivity and exceptional stretchability. When utilized as the electron transport layer in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.27&#8201;% with impressive stability. Additionally, fully stretchable inverted OSCs fabricated with QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 demonstrated a PCE of 14.01&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photocatalytic activity and inherent brittleness of ZnO, which is commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), have impeded advancements in device stability and the development of fully stretchable OSCs. In this study, an intrinsically stretchable ETL for inverted OSCs through a side&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking strategy has been developed. Specifically, cross&#8208;linking between bromine atoms on the side chains of a quinoidal compound and the amino groups in polyethylenimine resulted in a film, designated QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, with high electrical conductivity (0.049 S/m) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain&gt;45&#8201;%). When used as the ETL in inverted OSCs, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 was markedly superior to ZnO in terms of device performance and stability, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27&#8201;% and a T80 lifetime exceeding 10000&#8197;h. Moreover, incorporation of QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 in fully stretchable inverted OSCs yielded a PCE of 14.01&#8201;%, and 80&#8201;% of the initial PCE was maintained after 21&#8201;% strain, showcasing its potential for wearable electronics.

         <title>Scalable Electro&#8208;Biosynthesis of Ectoine from Greenhouse Gases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electro&#8208;biocatalytic hybrid system is created for upcycling CO2 into a valuable C6 product (ectoine) by integrating an artificial nanostructured copper catalyst and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria powered by electricity. This work innovatively demonstrated the feasibility of merging electrochemical reactions with microbial processes for a promising CO2&#8208;based industrial biomanufacturing paradigm.







Abstract
Converting greenhouse gases into valuable products has become a promising approach for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral economy and sustainable development. However, the conversion efficiency depends on the energy yield of the substrate. In this study, we developed an electro&#8208;biocatalytic system by integrating electrochemical and microbial processes to upcycle CO2 into a valuable product (ectoine) using renewable energy. This system initiates the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, an energy&#8208;dense molecule, which then serves as an electrofuel to energize the growth of an engineered methanotrophic cell factory for ectoine biosynthesis. The scalability of this system was demonstrated using an array of ten 25&#8197;cm2 electrochemical cells equipped with a high&#8208;performance carbon&#8208;supported isolated copper catalyst. The system consistently generated methane at the cathode under a total partial current of approximately &#8722;37&#8197;A (~175&#8197;mmolCH4&#8201;h&#8722;1) and O2 at the anode under a total partial current of approximately 62&#8197;A (~583&#8197;mmolO2&#8201;h&#8722;1). This output met the requirements of a 3&#8208;L bioreactor, even at maximum CH4 and O2 consumption, resulting in the high&#8208;yield conversion of CO2 to ectoine (1146.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1).

     alt="Scalable Electro-Biosynthesis of Ectoine from Greenhouse Gases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel electro-biocatalytic hybrid system is created for upcycling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a valuable C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; product (ectoine) by integrating an artificial nanostructured copper catalyst and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria powered by electricity. This work innovatively demonstrated the feasibility of merging electrochemical reactions with microbial processes for a promising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based industrial biomanufacturing paradigm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting greenhouse gases into valuable products has become a promising approach for achieving a carbon-neutral economy and sustainable development. However, the conversion efficiency depends on the energy yield of the substrate. In this study, we developed an electro-biocatalytic system by integrating electrochemical and microbial processes to upcycle CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a valuable product (ectoine) using renewable energy. This system initiates the electrocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methane, an energy-dense molecule, which then serves as an electrofuel to energize the growth of an engineered methanotrophic cell factory for ectoine biosynthesis. The scalability of this system was demonstrated using an array of ten 25&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrochemical cells equipped with a high-performance carbon-supported isolated copper catalyst. The system consistently generated methane at the cathode under a total partial current of approximately &#8722;37&#8197;A (~175&#8197;mmol&lt;sub&gt;CH4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the anode under a total partial current of approximately 62&#8197;A (~583&#8197;mmol&lt;sub&gt;O2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This output met the requirements of a 3-L bioreactor, even at maximum CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption, resulting in the high-yield conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ectoine (1146.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work underscores the potential of electrifying the biosynthesis of valuable products from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, providing a sustainable avenue for biomanufacturing and energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Binding Induced Hydrogen Bond Network Connectivity on Ru&#8208;based Catalysts for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metastable Ru&#8208;based catalysts with regulated adsorption strength of hydroxyl species were synthesized for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). We unveil that the hydroxyl intermediates adsorbed on the electrode surface are responsible for the increased connectivity of hydrogen bond networks in the EDL region, and the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.







Abstract
Understanding the role of adsorbed intermediates at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on the structure of electrical double layer (EDL) is essential for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we prepared a series of unconventional face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) phase Ru&#8208;based catalysts (i.e. fcc&#8208;Ru, fcc&#8208;RuCr, and fcc&#8208;RuCrW) by rational tuning the binding energetics of hydroxyl intermediate to engineer the electrochemical interface and boost the performance of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The introduction of oxyphilic metals Cr and W can regulate the orbital occupation of Ru, promote the adsorption of hydroxyl species, resulting in an anomalous behavior that HOR performance under alkaline media exceeds acidic media. Experimental results and theoretical calculations unravel that the modulated adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface are responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and dynamic evolution of free water molecules from nearest to the electrode surface to above the gap region in the EDL, thereby leading to significantly increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network. Our work reveals a new understanding of the surface intermediates in controlling the dynamic process of interfacial water and hydrogen bonding network in HOR electrocatalysis, and will guide rational design of advanced electrocatalysts through electrochemical interfacial engineering.

         <title>Crystal Modulation of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide toward Long&#8208;Enduring Anionic Redox with Fast Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

An innovative crystal modulation strategy was proposed and implemented on a Mn&#8208;based cathode Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 with highly exposed {010} active facets and reinforced Mn&#8722;O bond, facilitating enduring anionic redox activity with fast kinetics. The robust structural stability and zero&#8208;strain behavior with ultra&#8208;low volume variation (0.1&#8197;C: 1.75&#8201;%, 1&#8197;C: 0.31&#8201;%, 5&#8197;C: 0.04&#8201;%) are directly revealed via advanced nondestructive time&#8208;resolved operando 2D&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with anionic redox reactions hold great potential for energy storage applications due to their ultra&#8208;high capacity and cost effectiveness. However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen&#8208;redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn&#8208;based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn&#8722;O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O&#8722;O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long&#8208;enduring reversible oxygen&#8208;redox activity (100&#8201;% high capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C and 84.28&#8201;% retention after 300&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Time&#8208;resolved operando two&#8208;dimensional X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero&#8208;strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra&#8208;low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1&#8197;C: 1.75&#8201;%, 1&#8197;C: 0.31&#8201;%, 5&#8197;C: 0.04&#8201;%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with superior performance. This work highlights the significance of crystal modulation and presents a universal approach in developing Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes with stable anionic redox for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Mechanochemical Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks: Cocrystal Precursor Strategy for Confined Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cocrystal precursor template strategy employs confined assembly for the synthesis of 2D&#8208;imine&#8208;COFs using N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons in a mechanochemical one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process. This strategy leverages the directionality of the helical hydrogen bonding network and the protonation transfer of amine monomers to facilitate the ordered stacking and confined assembly necessary for imine COF formation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional imine covalent organic frameworks (2D imine&#8208;COFs) are crystalline porous materials with broad application prospects. Despite the efforts into their design and synthesis, the mechanisms of their formation are still not fully understood. Herein, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step mechanochemical cocrystal precursor synthetic strategy is developed for efficient construction of 2D imine&#8208;COFs. The mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the cocrystal precursors of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT) and p&#8208;toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) sufficiently regulate the crystalline structure of COF. Evidenced by characterizations and theoretical studies, a helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network was constructed by the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular synthons between amino and sulfonic groups in TAPT&#8208;PTSA, demonstrating the role of cocrystals in promoting the organized stacking of interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, layer arrangement, and interlayer spacing, thus facilitating the orderly assembly of COFs. Moreover, the protonation degree of TAPT amines, which tuned nucleophilic directionality, enabled the sequential progression of intra&#8208; and interlayer imine condensation reactions, inhibiting the formation of amorphous polymers. The transformation from cocrystal precursors to COFs was achieved through comprehensive control of hydrogen bond and covalent bond sites. This work significantly advances the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated COF assembly and its mechanochemical method in the design and synthesis of 2D imine&#8208;COFs, further elucidating the mechanistic aspects of their mechanochemical synthesis.

You know what imine? Aryliminopyrazoles have demonstrated their suitability as photoswitches and in driving dynamic&#8208;covalent reactions out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. However, the influence of their structure on their photoswitching properties remains unknown. Here, we present the first comprehensive investigation into their structure&#8211;property relationship, a detailed list of design rules, and their ability to switch in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Photoswitchable imines demonstrate light&#8208;dependent dynamic covalent chemistry and can function as molecular ratchets. However, the design of aryliminopyrazoles (AIPs) has been limited to N&#8208;pyrazole derivatives with ortho&#8208;pyrrolidine motifs. The impact of other functionalization patterns on the photoswitching properties remains unknown. Here, we present a systematic structure&#8208;property analysis and study how the photoswitching properties can be tuned through ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of the phenyl ring in N&#8208;pyrazole and N&#8208;phenyl AIPs. This study establishes the first set of design rules for these AIP photoswitches and reports the most stable Z&#8208;isomer of an AIP to date, enabling its crystallization and resulting in the first reported crystal structure of a metastable Z&#8208;aldimine. Finally, we demonstrate that the AIPs are promising candidates for photoswitching in the condensed phase.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy&#8208;Dense Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

Through electrolyte design to simultaneously increase the Coulombic efficiency on the graphite anode side and enhance the oxidation stability on the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) Prussian blue analogue cathode side, stable, low&#8208;cost, and energy&#8208;dense PIBs can be realized with specific energy and cycling stability comparable to the contemporary LiFePO4&#8208;based LIBs and superior to emerging SIBs.







Abstract
Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low&#8208;cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low&#8208;voltage anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&gt;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14&#8201;% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94&#8201;%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4&#8197;V (vs. K+/K) high&#8208;voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full&#8208;cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61&#8197;V with a specific energy of 316.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1&#8722;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Photo&#8208;Assisted Large Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting with Mott&#8208;Schottky Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MnWO4/FeCoNi Mott&#8208;Schottky heterostructure allows photogenerated electrons to directly participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and photogenerated holes to promote rapid reconstruction of Ni(FeCo)OOH/MnOOH species for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These two different modes of action exhibit enhanced and stable photogenerated carrier&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic (PCA&#8208;EC) water splitting under the support of heterostructure.large current densityMott&#8208;Schottky heterojunction coatingoverall water splittingphotogenerated carrier&#8208;assistedreconstruction







Abstract
The development of bifunctional photogenerated carrier&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic (PCA&#8208;EC) electrodes that operate with stability at large current&#8208;density remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a simple sputtering&#8208;deposition process to synthesize a novel MnWO4/FeCoNi Mott&#8208;Schottky heterojunction coating and deposit it on a pure Ti substrate to prepare high&#8208;performance PCA&#8208;EC electrodes, which exhibits enhanced light absorption range/intensity and rapidly separated photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This design allows photogenerated electrons to directly participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the strong oxidation of photogenerated holes significantly reduces the defect formation energy of active metals, thereby facilitating the rapid reconstruction of highly active Ni(FeCo)OOH/MnOOH species for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared electrode demonstrates the overpotentials of 64&#8197;mV for the HER and 204&#8197;mV for the OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under illumination. Benefiting from the stable interface with Fe/Co/Ni&#8208;O&#8722;Mn/W bonding units, the dual&#8208;electrode photoassisted electrolytic cell achieves long&#8208;term stability at current densities of 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides detailed insights into the enhancement mechanism of PCA&#8208;EC and contributes to the development of photo&#8208;assisted water splitting electrodes for large current&#8208;density applications.

The open&#8208;shell strategy has been applied in the modification of several drugs. Large&#8208;scale experiments, continuous&#8208;flow experiment, and versatile manipulation of products have demonstrated the robustness and potential utility of this synthetic method.







Abstract
Functional group translocation is undoubtedly a pivotal synthetic transformation in organic chemistry. Numerous types of reactions involving radical 1,2&#8208;aryl or 1,4&#8208;aryl migration via electron transfer mechanism have been extensively investigated. Nevertheless, energy&#8208;transfer enabled 1,4&#8208;arylation remains unknown. Herein we disclose that an unprecedented di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement featuring 1,4&#8208;aryl migration facilitated by energy transfer catalysis under visible light conditions. The newly developed mild protocol exhibits tolerance towards diverse functional groups and enables the migration of a multitude of aromatic rings, encompassing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;rich functional groups. The open&#8208;shell strategy has also found successful application in the modification of several drugs. Large&#8208;scale experiments, continuous&#8208;flow experiment, and versatile manipulation of products have demonstrated the robustness and potential utility of this synthetic method. Preliminary mechanistic studies have supported the involvement of radical species in this di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ethane rearrangement and have also provided evidence for the energy transfer mechanism.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hydrazide&#8208;Based Nanochannels: Efficient Water Translocation and Salt Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazide backbone&#8208;derived structures create a paired water&#8208;conveying conduit in the solid state and the lipid bilayer membrane. These channel arrangements effectively facilitate water transport across the bilayer membrane while preventing the passage of protons and salts.







Abstract
Nature has ingeniously developed specialized water transporters that effectively reject ions, including protons, while transporting water across membranes. These natural water channels, known as aquaporins (AQPs), have inspired the creation of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). However, replicating superfast water transport with synthetic molecular structures that exclude salts and protons is a challenging task. This endeavor demands the coexistence of a suitable water&#8208;binding site and a selective filter for precise water transportation. Here, we present small&#8208;molecule hydrazides 1&#8201;b&#8211;1&#8201;d that self&#8208;assemble into a rosette&#8208;type nanochannel assembly through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, and selectively transport water molecules across lipid bilayer membranes. The experimental analysis demonstrates notable permeability rates for the 1&#8201;c derivative, enabling approximately 3.18&#215;108 water molecules to traverse the channel per second. This permeability rate is about one order of magnitude lower than that of AQPs. Of particular significance, the 1&#8201;c ensures exclusive passage of water molecules while effectively blocking salts and protons.

     alt="Self-Assembled Hydrazide-Based Nanochannels: Efficient Water Translocation and Salt Rejection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrazide backbone-derived structures create a paired water-conveying conduit in the solid state and the lipid bilayer membrane. These channel arrangements effectively facilitate water transport across the bilayer membrane while preventing the passage of protons and salts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature has ingeniously developed specialized water transporters that effectively reject ions, including protons, while transporting water across membranes. These natural water channels, known as aquaporins (AQPs), have inspired the creation of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). However, replicating superfast water transport with synthetic molecular structures that exclude salts and protons is a challenging task. This endeavor demands the coexistence of a suitable water-binding site and a selective filter for precise water transportation. Here, we present small-molecule hydrazides &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&#8211;1&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt; that self-assemble into a rosette-type nanochannel assembly through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking interactions, and selectively transport water molecules across lipid bilayer membranes. The experimental analysis demonstrates notable permeability rates for the &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; derivative, enabling approximately 3.18&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; water molecules to traverse the channel per second. This permeability rate is about one order of magnitude lower than that of AQPs. Of particular significance, the &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; ensures exclusive passage of water molecules while effectively blocking salts and protons. MD simulation studies confirmed the stability and water transport properties of the water channel assembly inside the bilayer membranes at ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally Asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn Node in Metal&#8211;Organic Layers on Carbon Nitride Support for CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange of high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes induced Jahn&#8211;Teller lattice distortion at adjacent Ni sites, significantly enhancing CO2 photoreduction by promoting CO2 adsorption through enhanced orbital overlap and facilitating charge carrier migration via additional spin&#8208;polarized electrons.







Abstract
The Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) effect&#8208;induced lattice distortion presents an advantageous approach to tailor the electronic structure and CO2 adsorption properties of catalytic centers, consequently conferring desirable photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, achieving precise J&#8211;T distortion control over catalytic sites to enhance CO2 adsorption/activation and target&#8208;product desorption remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we successfully induced J&#8211;T lattice distortion in neighboring Ni sites by exchanging high&#8208;spin Mn2+ into Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes. EXAFS results and DFT simulations revealed that the highly asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes induced structural contraction (shortened Ni&#8722;O bonds) in the adjacent Ni&#8722;O lattice. The magnetic hysteresis loop (M&#8722;H) confirmed that the introduction of Mn2+ increased the number of spin electrons, thereby increasing the magnetization intensity. The spin mismatch between photogenerated electrons and holes suppressed charge recombination. Significantly, the d orbitals of the Ni sites in the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited strong orbital hybridization with the p orbitals of CO2, as evidenced by the enhanced d&#8208;p orbital overlap, facilitating rapid CO2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, the sample featuring lattice&#8208;mismatched Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Mn nodes exhibited an 8.79&#8208;fold enhancement in CO production rate compared to the Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ni nodes, in the absence of cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents.

         <title>Reviving Multivalent&#8208;Metal Anodes in Simple Salt Electrolytes via Component Modifier Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically impervious passivating film on multivalent&#8208;metal anodes seriously impairs their cycling efficiencies and lifespan. To address this issue, this work proposes the structure design principle of component modifiers via balancing the corrosion and passivation reactions toward metal&#8208;anodes, achieving exceptional metal electro&#8208;plating/stripping cycling stability.







Abstract
Using combinatory electrolyte blends represents an imperative avenue to achieve good magnesium (Mg)&#8208;metal anode compatibility and commercial feasibility in fields of promising rechargeable Mg batteries. However, fundamental challenges of how to manipulate component modifier reactivity on molecule level still remain to be solved. Here, molecular structure design concepts towards seeking bromophenyl complex&#8208;based component modifiers has been proposed according to implications of electron&#8208;donating and/or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on Br&#8722;C bond dissociation reactivity. Exceptional Mg electro&#8208;plating/stripping properties (a stable cycle life of 250&#8197;days in Mg//Cu asymmetric cells) have been firstly achieved in a simple salt electrolyte with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylmethanamine (BPDMA) as optimal component modifier. Comprehensive analyses disclose the unique electrochemically&#8208;active Br&#8208;containing ion&#8208;pairs formation, such as [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)Br&#8722;]2+ and [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)(Br&#8722;)(G2)2]2+, which results in the much thinner Br&#8722; containing and organic&#8211;inorganic mixed interphases on Mg&#8208;metal anodes. Furthermore, conventional MgSO4&#8208;based electrolytes and even calcium (Ca)&#8208;ion electrolytes can also be revived by similar strategy, demonstrating its generality and superiority.

         <title>Fully Exposed Ru Clusters for the Efficient Multi&#8208;Step Toluene Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully exposed and atomically dispersed Ru clusters composed by an average of 3 Ru atoms were successfully fabricated and exhibited robust catalytic performance in the multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of toluene to methylcyclohexane, compared with Ru single atoms, Ru nanoparticles and even previously reported catalysts. The theoretical calculations revealed that the synergetic interaction among neighboring Ru atoms in the fully exposed cluster guarantees effective activation of the reactant and easy desorption of the product.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are attractive platform molecules that play an important role in hydrogen energy storage and utilization. The multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of toluene (TOL) to methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been widely studied in the LOCHs systems, due to their relatively low toxicity and reasonable hydrogen storage capacity. Noble metal catalysts such as Ru has exhibited good performance in multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reactions, while the application is still hindered by their high cost and low specific activity. Therefore, the primary challenge lies in the development of noble metal catalysts with both robust activity and efficient atomic utilization. In this study, a series of Ru species ranging from single atoms, fully exposed clusters to nanoparticles were fabricated to investigate their structural evolution in the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction. The fully exposed and atomically dispersed Ru clusters, composed of an average of 3 Ru atoms, exhibit superior catalytic performance and recycle ability in TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation. Moreover, it delivers a high turnover frequency of 9850.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 under the relatively mild reaction (100&#8201;&#176;C, 1.5&#8197;MPa), compared with those of single atoms and nanoparticles, and shows a notable advantage over catalysts reported in previous studies. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the overall barrier of the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction over the fully exposed Ru clusters is significantly lower than that of single atoms and nanoparticles, resulting in its higher activity. The present work provides an efficient strategy to regulate the reaction pathway of multi&#8208;step complicated catalytic reactions by designing fully exposed metal cluster catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous Cycloadditions in the Solid State via Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous [4+4] and [2+2] cycloadditions are achieved within a single crystalline solid for the first time. The cycloadditions occur with complete control over regiochemistry, stereochemistry, and in high yield, whereas simultaneous solution reactions afford a mixture of isomers. Reaction reversibility and application to solar thermal storage materials is also discussed.







Abstract
Chemical reactions conducted in the solid phase (specifically, crystalline) are much less numerous than solution reactions, primarily due to reduced motion, flexibility, and reactivity. The main advantage of crystalline&#8208;state transformations is that reactant molecules can be designed to self&#8208;assemble into specific spatial arrangements, often leading to high control over product regiochemistry and/or stereochemistry. In crystalline&#8208;phase transformations, typically only one type of reaction occurs, and a sacrificial template molecule is frequently used to facilitate self&#8208;assembly, similar to a catalyst or enzyme. Here, we demonstrate the first system designed to undergo two chemically unique and orthogonal cycloaddition reactions simultaneously within a single crystalline solid. Well&#8208;controlled supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two molecules containing different reactive moieties affords orthogonal reactivity without use of a sacrificial template. Using only UV light, the simultaneous [2+2] and [4+4] cycloadditions are achieved regiospecifically, stereospecifically, and products are obtained in high yield, whereas a simultaneous solution&#8208;state reaction affords a mixture of isomers in low yield. Application of dually&#8208;reactive systems toward (supra)molecular solar thermal storage materials is also discussed. This work demonstrates fundamental chemical approaches for orthogonal reactivity in the crystalline state and highlights the complexity and reversibility that can be achieved with supramolecular design.

&lt;p&gt;Chemical reactions conducted in the solid phase (specifically, crystalline) are much less numerous than solution reactions, primarily due to reduced motion, flexibility, and reactivity. The main advantage of crystalline-state transformations is that reactant molecules can be designed to self-assemble into specific spatial arrangements, often leading to high control over product regiochemistry and/or stereochemistry. In crystalline-phase transformations, typically only one type of reaction occurs, and a sacrificial template molecule is frequently used to facilitate self-assembly, similar to a catalyst or enzyme. Here, we demonstrate the first system designed to undergo two chemically unique and orthogonal cycloaddition reactions simultaneously within a single crystalline solid. Well-controlled supramolecular self-assembly of two molecules containing different reactive moieties affords orthogonal reactivity without use of a sacrificial template. Using only UV light, the simultaneous [2+2] and [4+4] cycloadditions are achieved regiospecifically, stereospecifically, and products are obtained in high yield, whereas a simultaneous solution-state reaction affords a mixture of isomers in low yield. Application of dually-reactive systems toward (supra)molecular solar thermal storage materials is also discussed. This work demonstrates fundamental chemical approaches for orthogonal reactivity in the crystalline state and highlights the complexity and reversibility that can be achieved with supramolecular design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Autocatalytic Reaction Networks: A Pathway to Spatial Temporal Mastery in Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) has been developed that enables efficient control over sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. This approach, supported by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, provides a theoretical framework for system preprogramming and demonstrates the potential for reversible, repeatable sol&#8208;gel transitions, shaping new frontiers in material science and bioengineering.







Abstract
Autocatalytic reaction present a significant opportunity for the precise spatial and temporal control of dynamic materials, mimicking the characteristics of living matter within autonomous chemical systems. Herein, we have crafted an autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) designed to be incorporated into a dynamic system, allowing for efficient control of both sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. The CRN incorporates two autocatalytic reactions. The first reaction promotes the formation of disulfide crosslinks while increasing the local pH through base product generation, catalyzing further disulfide bond formation and initiating a polymerization front that transforms the liquid phase into a gel. A subsequent, slower reaction triggered at the gel/air interface, resulted in the breakage of disulfide crosslinks, transforming the gel back into a liquid state through accelerating fronts. The dynamics of these autocatalytic fronts are accurately predicted by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, providing a theoretical framework for system preprogramming. Moreover, our results show that the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition can be reliably repeated multiple times. This approach not only enhances our understanding of autocatalytic CRNs but also pioneers a new approach for developing dynamic materials with life&#8208;like properties, significantly impacting material science and bioengineering.

         <title>Endo&#8208;Encapsulated Multi&#8208;Resonance Dendrimers with Through&#8208;Space Interactions for Efficient Narrowband Blue&#8208;Emitting Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>

Endo&#8208;encapsulated luminescent dendrimers consisting of multi&#8208;resonance fluorophore embedded inside of carbazole dendrons are first reported, which not only resist aggregation&#8208;caused spectral broadening but also induce through&#8208;space interactions between dendron and fluorophore to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing, giving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device efficiency with maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.6&#8201;% for narrowband luminescent dendrimers so far.







Abstract
Different from conventional luminescent dendrimers with fluorophore tethered outside to dendron, here we first developed endo&#8208;encapsulated luminescent dendrimers with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fluorophore embedded inside of carbazole dendrons by growing dendrons through 1,8&#8208;positions of central carbazole moiety to create a cavity for accommodating the fluorophore. This endo&#8208;encapsulated structure not only shields the fluorophore to fully resist aggregation&#8208;caused spectral broadening, but also induce through&#8208;space interactions between dendron and fluorophore via intramolecular &#960;&#8208;stacking, giving lowered singlet state energy and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet states. The resultant dendrimer containing 1,8&#8208;linked second&#8208;generation carbazole dendrons and boron, sulfur&#8208;doped polycyclic MR fluorophore exhibits narrowband blue emission at 471&#8197;nm with FWHM kept at 34&#8197;nm even in neat film, together with ~4&#8197;times enhancement of RISC rate constant compared to its exo&#8208;tethered counterpart. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on the endo&#8208;encapsulated dendrimer reveal efficient narrowband blue emissions with maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.6&#8201;%, representing the best device efficiency for blue&#8208;emitting multi&#8208;resonance dendrimers so far.

         <title>Designing a Refined Multi&#8208;Structural Polymer Electrolyte Framework for Highly Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous and multi&#8208;component ion&#8208;conductive polymer&#8208;based electrolyte was designed based on a refined multi&#8208;structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework. Lithium metal cells with RMSPE have the advantages of high ionic conductivity (0.93&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical window (to 5.1&#8197;V), high Li+ transference number (0.7), long lifetime (&gt;3300 cycles at 1&#8197;C at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent low&#8208;temperature adaptability (&gt;200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
Rational structural designs of solid polymer electrolytes featuring rich interface&#8208;phase morphologies can improve electrolyte connection and rapid ion transport. However, these rigid interfacial structures commonly result in diminished or entirely inert ionic conductivity within their bulk phase, compromising overall electrolyte performance. Herein, a multi&#8208;component ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte was successfully designed based on a refined multi&#8208;structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework with uniform Li+ solvation chemistry and rapid Li+ transporting kinetics. The RMSPE framework is constructed via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation based on a rational combination of lithiophilic components and rigid/flexible chain units with significant hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrasts. Further refined by coating a robust polymer network, this all&#8208;organic design endows a homogeneous micro&#8208;nano porous structure, providing a novel framework favorable for rapid ion transport in both its soft interfacial and bulk phases. The RMSPE exhibited excellent ion conductivity of 1.91&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and a high Li+ transference number of 0.7. Assembled symmetrical Li cells realized stable cycling for over 2400&#8197;h at 3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrated a long lifespan of 3300 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;% and stable cycling performance at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C. This innovative design concept offers a promising perspective for achieving high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based Li metal batteries.

         <title>Opal&#8208;Inspired SiO2&#8208;Mediated Carbon Dot Doping Enables the Synthesis of Monodisperse Multifunctional Afterglow Nanocomposites for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from the formation of nanoinclusions in opal, we present a novel SiO2&#8208;mediated carbon dot doping method for fabricating monodisperse, multifunctional afterglow nanocomposites. This versatile method offers significant flexibility in selecting core nanoparticles and doping impurities, enabling the integration of multifunctionality into single&#8208;particle platforms. Additionally, it allows for precise optical tuning of the afterglow characteristics.







Abstract
Despite recent advancements in inorganic and organic phosphors, creating monodisperse afterglow nanocomposites (NCs) remains challenging due to the complexities of wet chemistry synthesis. Inspired by nanoinclusions in opal, we introduce a novel SiO2&#8208;mediated carbon dot (CD) doping method for fabricating monodisperse, multifunctional afterglow NCs. This method involves growing a SiO2 shell matrix on monodisperse nanoparticles (NPs) and doping CDs into the SiO2 shell under hydrothermal conditions. Our approach preserves the monodispersity of the parent NP@SiO2 NCs while activating a green afterglow in the doped CDs with an impressive lifetime of 1.26&#8197;s. Additionally, this method is highly versatile, allowing for various core and dopant combinations to finely tune the afterglow through core&#8208;to&#8208;CD or CD&#8208;to&#8208;dye energy transfer. Our findings significantly enhance the potential of SiO2 coatings, transforming them from merely enhancing the biocompatibility of NCs to serving as a versatile matrix for emitters, facilitating afterglow generation and paving the way for new applications.

         <title>Atmosphere Induces Tunable Oxygen Vacancies to Stabilize Single&#8208;Atom Copper in Ceria for Robust Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>

Oxygen vacancy stabilizes the single&#8208;atomic copper active site, which effectively promotes CO2 activation, and regulates the adsorption energy of key reaction intermediates on the surface of Cu/ceria catalyst, thus improving the selectivity and conversion rate to methane in ECO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECO2RR) shows great potential to create high&#8208;value carbon&#8208;based chemicals, while designing advanced catalysts at the atomic level remains challenging. The ECO2RR performance is largely dependent on the catalyst microelectronic structure that can be effectively modulated through surface defect engineering. Here, we provide an atmosphere&#8208;assisted low&#8208;temperature calcination strategy to prepare a series of single&#8208;atomic Cu/ceria catalysts with varied oxygen vacancy concentrations for robust electrolytic reduction of CO2 to methane. The obtained Cu/ceria catalyst under H2 environment (Cu/ceria&#8208;H2) exhibits a methane Faraday efficiency (FECH4) of 70.03&#8201;% with a turnover frequency (TOFCH4) of 9946.7&#8197;h&#8722;1 at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Detailed studies indicate the copious oxygen vacancies in the Cu/ceria&#8208;H2 are conducive to regulating the surface microelectronic structure with stabilized Cu+ active center. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS demonstrate that the Cu/ceria&#8208;H2 can markedly enhance the activation of CO2, facilitate the adsorption of pivotal intermediates *COOH and *CO, thus ultimately enabling the high selectivity for CH4 production. This study presents deep insights into designing effective electrocatalysts for CO2 to CH4 conversion by controlling the surface microstructure via the reaction atmosphere.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Anionic Coordination Manipulation Induces Phosphorus and Boron&#8208;Rich Gradient Interphase Towards Stable and Safe Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte that constructs a gradient CEI dominated by inorganic compounds. This interphase is thin, dense, and enriched with phosphides and borides, which effectively inhibits side&#8208;reactions and facilitates rapid Na+ transport, thus enabling safe and stable cycling of SMBs.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage sodium metal batteries (SMBs) present a viable pathway towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;based batteries due to the competitive cost advantage and abundant supply of sodium resources. However, they still suffer from severe capacity decay induced by the notorious decomposition of the electrolyte under high voltage and unstable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). In addition, the high reactivity of Na metal and flammable electrolytes push SMBs to their safety limits. Herein, a special dual&#8208;anion aggregated Na+ solvation structure is designed in a nonflammable trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, and a gradient CEI enriched with phosphorus and boron compounds is formed on the cathode. This thin and stable interphase effectively suppresses the parasitic reaction, improves the interfacial stability of the cathode, and facilitates Na+ transport through the interface by the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;components, thus optimizing the cycling stability and safety of SMBs. The Na0.95Ni0.4Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2//Na batteries employing such electrolyte provide a discharge capacity of 167.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high retention in the capacity of 85.2&#8201;% after 800&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This approach offers a general strategy for the design of flame&#8208;retardant high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and the practical application of SMBs.

         <title>Bright Nanocomposites based on Quantum Dot&#8208;Initiated Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum Dot (QD)&#8208;polymer nanocomposites with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield aredemonstrated through a novel approach, where bright QDs effectively photoinitiate (photocatalyze) in&#8197;situ bulk polymerization. Without using any radical initiators and cocatalysts, the photoexcited QDs act as &#8216;overall reaction&#8217; catalysts by simultaneously employing photoexcited holes and electrons to produce active radicals for initiating radical polymerization.







Abstract
Integrating quantum dots (QDs) into polymer matrix to form nanocomposites without compromising the QD photoluminescence (PL) is crucial to emerging QD light&#8208;emitting and solar energy conversion fields. However, the most widely&#8208;used bulk polymerization technique, where monomers serve as the QD solvent, usually leads to QD PL quenching caused by radical initiators. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;brightness nanocomposites with near&#8208;unity PL quantum yield (QY), through a novel QDs&#8208;catalyzed (&#8208;initiated) bulk polymerization without using any radical initiators. Different from previous reports where QDs were designed as photo&#8208;sensitizers/catalysts (always with cocatalysts) and hence non&#8208;emissive in catalytic conditions, our QDs combine high brightness with highly effective catalysis, a combination that was previously considered to be hardly possible. In our case, apart from emitting light (at a large probability), the photoexcited QDs act as &#8216;overall reaction&#8217; catalysts by simultaneously employing photoexcited electrons and holes to produce active radicals without the need of any sacrificial agents. These active radicals, though with a small amount, are sufficient to initiate effective chain reaction&#8208;dominated bulk polymerization, eliminating the requirement of extra radical initiators. This study provides new insights for understanding and development of QDs for energy applications.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate as an Ionic Molecular Lock for Ultrastrong Fluorescence of Single Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we modified organic molecules with calcium carbonate oligomers (CCO, (CaCO3)n) in individual molecular states, functionalizing organic molecules with inorganic ionic segments as molecular locks. Due to the rigidity of ionic compound and characteristic of ionic bond, it realized the ultrastrong fluorescence of organic molecules in single molecular state without the change of maximum emission wavelength both in solution and solid.







Abstract
Locking molecular conformation are widely applied in molecular engineering for improved performance. However, locking via organic functional groups often changes the original molecular properties. Following the rigidity and stability of ionic interaction in ionic compounds, we suggested the use of a molecular&#8208;scale ionic compound, calcium carbonate oligomer, as a robust molecular segment to functionalize organic molecules. The rigid structure of the ionic molecular segments locked the organic molecules, which could remarkably limit the intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions. This ensured a stable and ultrastrong fluorescence of the single organic molecule while preserving its original maximum emission wavelength. The locking strategy was general and extendable to multiple organic molecules. Additionally, the ultrastrong single&#8208;molecular fluorescence can be maintained in inorganic solids with even higher quantum yields and almost unchanged maximum emission wavelength. The highest quantum yield of the investigated molecules reached 99.9&#8201;%, superior to all reported organic&#8208;inorganic fluorescent composite under air conditions. This work demonstrates a general strategy to restrict intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions by using ionic oligomers as molecular locks, providing an alternative method for realizing ultraemissive molecules. This further demonstrates a fascinating example of molecular engineering in the presence of inorganic ionic molecules.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Fluoride Molecular Glue to Improve the SnO2/Perovskite Interface for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

A highly effective 3D fluoride molecular glue strategy has been developed for efficient and stable PSCs. Simultaneous incorporation of the KBF4/TFMSA demonstrates 25.8&#8201;% PCE with negligible hysteresis, and 1&#8197;cm2 PSCs presents a certified 24.57&#8201;% PCE. The KBF4 and TFMSA afford 3D fluoride passivator by strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Synergistic passivation effect toward the SnO2 and perovskite layer can reduce the non&#8208;radiative recombination and guarantee high&#8208;performance including exceptional stability.







Abstract
Aiming at numerous defects at SnO2/perovskite interface and lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we design a kind of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular glue (KBF4&#8208;TFMSA), which is derived from strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between potassium tetrafluoroborate (KBF4) and trifluoromethane&#8208;sulfonamide (TFMSA). A remarkable efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis and a stabilized power output of 25.0&#8201;% have been achieved, in addition, 24.57&#8201;% certified efficiency of 1&#8197;cm2 device is also obtained. Further investigation reveals that this KBF4&#8208;TFMSA can interact with oxygen vacancies and under&#8208;coordinated Sn(IV) from the SnO2, in the meantime, FA+ (NH2&#8722;C=NH2+) and K+ cations can be well fixed by hydrogen bonding interaction between FA+ and BF4&#8722;, and electrostatic attraction between sulfonyl oxygen and K+ ions, respectively. Thereby, FAPbI3 crystal grain sizes are increased, interfacial defects are significantly reduced while carrier extraction/ transportation is facilitated, leading to better cell performance and excellent stabilities. Non&#8208;encapsulated devices can maintain 91&#8201;% of their initial efficiency under maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point (MPP) tracking while continuous illumination (~100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for 1000&#8197;h, and retain 91&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h &#8220;double 60&#8221; damp&#8208;heat stability testing (60&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;%RH (RH, relatively humidity)).

         <title>Nanocarriers Made of Natural Fatty Acids: Modulation of Their Release Profiles through Photo&#8208;Crosslinking</title>

Slow down: Photo&#8208;crosslinking is used to mitigate the dissolution and degradation of natural fatty acids in a body fluid mimic, achieving sustained release in cells with controllable kinetics for drug delivery, nanomedicine, and related applications.







Abstract
Natural fatty acids are attractive carrier materials for drug delivery, but their rapid dissolution and degradation in vivo calls for new strategies to enhance their stability. Here we report a simple and versatile method capable of photo&#8208;crosslinking carriers made of natural fatty acids for drug delivery under controlled release. By optimizing the crosslinking density, the nanoscale carriers show a high drug loading efficiency, together with a stable network structure for minimal degradation in a body fluid mimic. Fluorescence microscopy analysis also reveals the exceptional intracellular stability of the crosslinked network, resulting in negligible cytotoxicity toward A549 cells up to 24&#8197;h when loaded with a potent anticancer drug. We further extend this strategy to microscale carriers fabricated using electrospray. Upon photo&#8208;crosslinking, the carriers show a retarded release of nerve growth factor, resulting in slower neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion. This work holds promise for addressing the efficacy and safety issues critical to nanomedicine and related applications.

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Efficient Macrocyclic Emitters Featuring Delayed Fluorescence by Conjugation Length and Cavity Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel macrocyclic thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds, MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST, with varying conjugation lengths and cavity dimensions were synthesized for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 32.7&#8201;% was achieved by the device based on MC&#8208;TST, showcasing the potential of TADF macrocycles in organic optoelectronics.







Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics have attracted widespread attention in the field of organic electroluminescence (EL) materials due to their unique geometries and excellent luminescence performance. Despite the significant impact of conjugation length and cavity dimensions on molecular conformation, the influence of these factors on the excited&#8208;state properties remains understudied. Herein, we formulated a strategy aimed at modulating the conformation of TADF macrocyclic molecules containing aniline as the donor (D) unit, and triazine as the acceptor (A), linked in D&#8722;A and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alternative macrocyclic construction (MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST). Corroborated by experimental and theoretical analyses, the compact and conformationally twisted MC&#8208;TNT exhibits efficient blue luminescence in crystalline state, facilitating EL at high doping concentrations with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 13.9&#8201;%, leading the field of blue macrocyclic emitters. Notably, MC&#8208;TST with &#960;&#8208;bridge and flat conformation, demonstrates diminished Coulombic repulsion, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield and superior horizontal dipole orientation of 85&#8201;% in 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% doped films, and the corresponding device&#8216;s EQEmax reaches record&#8208;high 32.7&#8201;% within the TADF macrocyclic domain.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stage Reduction Strategy of Tin Perovskite Enables High Performance Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study firstly proposes sustained dynamic reduction using a dual&#8208;stage reduction strategy to fabricate devices of high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Ultimately, a champion power conversion efficiency of 14.78&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% of initial efficiency after 628&#8197;h at maximum power.







Abstract
The rapid oxidation of Sn2+ in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) restricts their efficiency and stability have been main bottleneck towards further development. This study developed a novel strategy which utilizes thiosulfate ions (S2O32&#8722;) in the precursor solution to enable a dual&#8208;stage reduction process. In the solution stage, thiosulfate acted as an efficacious reducing agent to reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+, meanwhile, its oxidation products were able to reduce I2 to I&#8722; during the film stage. This dual reduction ability effectively inhibited the oxidation of Sn2+ and passivated defects, further promising an excellent stability of the perovskite devices. As a result, thiosulfate&#8208;incorporated devices achieved a high efficiency of 14.78&#8201;% with open&#8208;circuit voltage reaching 0.96&#8197;V. The stability of the optimized devices achieved a remarkable improvement, maintaining 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after 628&#8197;hours at maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point (MPP). The findings provid research insights and experimental data support for the sustained dynamic reduction in TPSCs.

         <title>A Structural and Functional Mimic of P680+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex has been developed as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric&#8208;chlorophyll reaction center found in photosystem II. The corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex was prepared and characterized. The dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation of phenols compared to its monomeric counterpart indicating that photosynthetic reaction centers may employ multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes in order to lower the barrier to PCET oxidation.







Abstract
One or multiple chlorophyll a molecules are employed in the reaction center of photosystem II&#8242;s main electron donor (defined as P680). We have a poor understanding of how the reaction center facilitates water oxidation in photosystem II and the roles that mono&#8208; and/or multimeric chlorophyll groups play when P680 oxidizes a neighboring tyrosine in order to drive water oxidation at the oxygen evolving complex. We have prepared a dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex [Mg2(BTPP)] (1, H4&#8208;BTPP=1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene) as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric core of P680. 1 was oxidized by one&#8208;electron to the corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex 2. The radical cation was characterized by UV/Vis&#8208;NIR, FT&#8208;IR, and EPR spectroscopic techniques. 2 was shown to be reactive towards phenols to give the corresponding phenoxyl radicals, mimicking the reactivity of the P680 cation radical which oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. Critically, the dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer oxidation (PCET) of phenols when compared to its monomeric counterpart [Mg(TPP)] (TPP=5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin). Our findings demonstrate that MgII&#8208;porphyrin complexes are reliable mimics of photosynthetic PCET processes and suggest that photosynthetic reaction centers with multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes likely lower the barrier to PCET oxidation by &#960;&#8208;cation radical species.

         <title>Upcycling Iron Oxide Scale Slag into a High&#8208;Performance, Sustainable Ozone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Iron oxide scale slag by creating a compact junction between Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 phases, their synergistic effect could be harnessed by inhibiting passivation of the Fe2O3 surface and enhancing the catalytic conversion of the adsorbed O3 on the Fe3O4 surface, thus reducing catalyst deactivation and improving the treatment ability of practical antibiotic wastewater (after 2&#8197;h treatment, COD removal rate 81.7&#8201;%).







Abstract
Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70&#8201;% Fe2O3 and 40.30&#8201;% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70&#8201;% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of An Ideal Chain Antiferromagnet [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)](H3O)2Fe2F10 with Spin S=5/2</title>

A novel ideal one&#8208;dimensional (1D) S=5/2 chain antiferromagnetic compound [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)](H3O)2Fe2F10 (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) is obtained by single&#8208;step hydrothermal method at low temperature by intentionally pronating 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy ligand. The obtained compound exhibits no magnetic long&#8208;range ordering down to 0.5&#8197;K, showing the best 1D magnetism to date.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) magnets are of great interest owing to their intriguing quantum phenomena and potential application in quantum computing. We successfully synthesized an ideal antiferromagnetic spin S=5/2 chain compound [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)](H3O)2Fe2F10 (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) 1, using a single&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal method under conditions that favors the protonation of the bulky bidentate ligand 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy. Compound 1 consists of well&#8208;separated (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#8734; chains with a large Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe angle of 174.8&#176;. Both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements show that 1 does not undergo a magnetic long&#8208;range ordering down to 0.5&#8197;K, despite the strong Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe intrachain spin exchange J with J/kB=&#8722;16.2(1) K. This indicates a negligibly weak interchain spin exchange J&#8242;. The J&#8242;/J value estimated for 1 is extremely small (&lt;2.8&#215;10&#8722;6), smaller than those reported for all other S=5/2 chain magnets. Our hydrothermal synthesis incorporates both [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)]2+ and (H3O)+ cations into the crystal lattice with numerous hydrogen bonds, hence effectively separating the (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#8734; spin chains. This single&#8208;step hydrothermal synthesis under conditions favoring the protonation of bulky bidentate ligands offers an effective synthetic strategy to prepare well&#8208;separated 1D spin chain systems of magnetic ions with various spin values.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation by Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals via Concerted Electron&#8208;Fluoride Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer (cEF&#8722;T) mechanism is revealed for C(sp3)&#8722;F activation by Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBBRs) with the aid of DFT calculations. Orbital interaction analyses have been conducted for rational design of LBBRs that could selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes, which enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom from fluorocarbons and the generation of an alkyl radical, broadening the scope of XAT reactions.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond activation through a radical pathway in the presence of multiple C&#8722;H bonds remains a formidable challenge, owing to the extraordinarily strong bond strength of the C&#8722;F bond. By the aid of density functional theory calculations, we disclose an innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer mechanism, harnessing the unique reactivity of Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals to selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes. This enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom and subsequent generation of an alkyl radical, thus expanding the boundaries of halogen atom transfer reactions.

Orbital interaction analyses have been conducted for rational design of &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;BRs&lt;/b&gt; that could selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes, which enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom from fluorocarbons and the generation of an alkyl radical, broadening the scope of XAT reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective C&#8722;F bond activation through a radical pathway in the presence of multiple C&#8722;H bonds remains a formidable challenge, owing to the extraordinarily strong bond strength of the C&#8722;F bond. By the aid of density functional theory calculations, we disclose an innovative concerted electron-fluoride transfer mechanism, harnessing the unique reactivity of Lewis base-boryl radicals to selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes. This enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom and subsequent generation of an alkyl radical, thus expanding the boundaries of halogen atom transfer reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Electrocatalysis for Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heteroarylation with Indoles, Pyrroles, and Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct anodic oxidative coupling process for &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation using ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis has been developed, enabling the synthesis of a diverse range of chiral heteroaromatic carbonyl compounds with high enantioselectivity and functional group tolerance, which can be applied to the synthesis of valuable frameworks like (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.







Abstract
Oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalizations represent an exemplary approach for synthesizing carbonyl compounds via &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation. Here we present the development of a direct anodic oxidative coupling process between 2&#8208;acylimidazoles and divergent heterocyclic systems including indole, pyrrole, and furan, facilitated by ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction initially involves the formation of a chiral Ni&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical, which is then captured by the heteroarene radical cation via intermolecular stereoselective radical/radical cation coupling. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, enabling access to a wide range of chiral hetero&#8208;compounds. The consequential &#945;&#8208;heteroaromatic carbonyl products can potentially be transformed into a plethora of synthetically valuable frameworks, as exemplified by their application in the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.

         <title>Integrated &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy for High&#8208;Rate Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi modified by CrOx was developed for high&#8208;rate formate electrosynthesis through CO2 reduction. The defective Bi provides abundant active sites for CO2 adsorption, and the CrOx species promote the hydrogenation of CO2* to *OCHO by accelerating H2O dissociation to provide H*, which synergistically contributes to the high performance.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECR) is a promising pathway to producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Despite extensive studies reported, improving CO2 adsorption for local CO2 enrichment or water dissociation to generate sufficient H* is still not enough to achieve industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Herein, we report a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi nanosheets modified by CrOx (Bi&#8722;CrOx), to simultaneously promote CO2 adsorption and water dissociation, thereby enhancing the activity and selectivity of ECR to formate. The Bi&#8722;CrOx exhibits an excellent Faradaic efficiency (&#8776;100&#8201;%) in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. In addition, it achieves a remarkable formate partial current density of 687&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a moderate potential of &#8722;0.9&#8197;V without iR compensation, the highest value at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V reported so far. Control experiments and theoretical simulations revealed that the defective Bi facilitates CO2 adsorption/activation while the CrOx accounts for enhancing the protonation process via accelerating H2O dissociation. This work presents a pathway to boosting formate production through tuning CO2 and H2O species at the same time.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Crosslinking Electrolytes for Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction and Solid&#8208;State Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li+&#8208;conducted coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP&#8208;Li) polymer electrolyte was developed for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li batteries, which is based on a cellulose&#8208;based copolymer with metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as the crosslinking agent. Benefiting from the advantages of MOPs and cellulose&#8208;based copolymers, the CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolytes exhibit both high ionic conductivity of 1.02&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and high Li+ transference number of 0.75 at 25 &#176;C. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries fabricated with CHMOP electrolyte show good cycling performance (500 cycles) and high discharge capacity (15740&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries paired with lithium (Li) metal anodes are considered to be promising high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive Li metal and the formation of Li dendrites during battery operation would cause safety concerns, especially with the employment of highly flammable liquid electrolytes. Herein, a general strategy by engineering coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks is proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance solid polymer electrolytes. Through the coordination of metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with cellulose&#8208;based copolymers, the Li+&#8208;conducted hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP&#8208;Li) polymer network is capable of enabling the rapid transport of Li+. In addition to the high Li+ conductivity (1.02&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also exhibits a high Li+ transference number (0.75) and a wide electrochemical stability window. Benefiting from the thermally stable and mechanically strong CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte film, the short&#8208;circuiting of the symmetric batteries is prevented even after 3200&#8197;h of cycling and a high specific energy of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 is achieved for the Li&#8208;metal battery. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries fabricated with CHMOP&#8208;Li electrolyte also show good cycling performance (500 cycles) and high discharge capacity (15740&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). The proposed coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking strategies offer an alternative route to design high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation sustainable battery chemistries.

         <title>d&#8208;Electrons of Platinum Alloy Steering CO Pathway for Low&#8208;Charge Potential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation of C and Li2CO3 is characterized by sluggish kinetics and unfavorable thermodynamics. Herein, the reaction pathway is successfully steered to a kinetically and thermodynamically favorable gas&#8208;solid reaction between CO and Li2CO3 by optimizing the Pt d&#8208;electron configuration. This strategy effectively improves the energy efficiency and cycle life of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from sluggish solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation kinetics of C and Li2CO3, requiring extremely high charging potentials and leading to serious side reactions and poor energy efficiency. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges by modulating the reaction pathway with tailored Pt d&#8208;electrons and develop an aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 battery with CO and Li2CO3 as the main discharge products. Note that the gas&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation reaction between CO and Li2CO3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with CoPt alloy&#8208;supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber (CoPt@NCNF) cathode exhibit a charging potential of 2.89&#8197;V at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the lowest charging potential to date. Moreover, the CoPt@NCNF cathode also shows exceptional cycling stability (218&#8197;cycles at 50&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high energy efficiency up to 74.6&#8201;%. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lowered d&#8208;band center of CoPt alloy effectively promotes CO desorption and inhibits further CO reduction to C. This work provides promising insights into developing efficient and CO&#8208;selective Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The solid-solid co-oxidation of C and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is characterized by sluggish kinetics and unfavorable thermodynamics. Herein, the reaction pathway is successfully steered to a kinetically and thermodynamically favorable gas-solid reaction between CO and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by optimizing the Pt &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-electron configuration. This strategy effectively improves the energy efficiency and cycle life of Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.

         <title>Static Organic p&#8208;n Junctions in Photoelectrodes for Solar Ammonia Production with 86&#8201;% Internal Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For molecular photoelectrodes, an organic p&#8208;n junction structure is reported which produces high&#8208;flux electrons under solar irradiation to drive efficient nitrate reduction to ammonia. With the p&#8208;n junction photoelectrode, the EQE and IQE for ammonia production are achieved at 57&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Our results represent an encouraging step forward in the design of robust organic photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;fuel production systems.







Abstract
For photoelectrocatalytic cells, a limitation exists in finding appropriate photoelectrode configurations that couple efficient extraction of high&#8208;energy electrons from absorbed photons and selective catalysis. Here we report an organic p&#8208;n junction approach to fabricate molecular photoelectrodes for conversion of solar energy and nitrate into valuable ammonia product. Solar irradiation of the photoelectrode generates charge&#8208;separated states with electrons and holes spatially separated at the n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type components, as revealed by surface photovoltage mapping, at a quantum yield of 90&#8201;%. The high&#8208;flux photogenerated electrons are rapidly transferred to the catalyst for solar ammonia production from nitrate reduction at an external quantum efficiency (EQE) and an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 57&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the large IQE originates from the combined high efficiencies for photoelectron generation, catalyst activation and dark catalysis. In a flow&#8208;cell setup coupled with a silicon solar cell, the photoelectrode without bias generates photocurrent of 57&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and ammonia at an EQE of 52&#8201;%.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide Allows Bioorthogonal Coupling of Type&#8208;I AIEgens for Pyroptosis&#8208;Induced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

We report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide, which can self&#8208;assemble on the cancer cell membrane. The formed nanofibers can provide abundant &#8220;click&#8221; sites to enrich aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers on the cell membrane for type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) to efficiently induce pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD).







Abstract
Enrichment of photosensitizers (PSs) on cancer cell membranes via bioorthogonal reactions is considered to be a very promising therapeutic modality. However, azide&#8208;modified sugars&#8208;based metabolic labeling processes usually lack targeting and the labeling speed is relatively slow. Moreover, it has been rarely reported that membrane&#8208;anchoring pure type&#8208;I PSs can induce cancer cell pyroptosis. Here, we report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide named DBCO&#8208;pYCCK6, which can selectively and rapidly self&#8208;assemble on cancer cell membrane, and then bioorthogonal enrich type&#8208;I aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) PSs (SAIE&#8208;N3) on the cell membrane. Upon light irradiation, the membrane&#8208;anchoring SAIE&#8208;N3 could effectively generate type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the bioorthogonal combination strategy of peptide and AIEgen PSs could significantly inhibit tumor growth, which is accompanied by CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration. This work provides a novel self&#8208;assembly peptide&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reaction strategy to bridge the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and AIE field through strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and elucidates that pure type&#8208;I membrane&#8208;anchoring PSs can be used for cancer therapy via GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis.

         <title>Unlocking Self&#8208;antioxidant Capability and Processability of Additive&#8208;free MXene Ink towards High&#8208;performance Customizable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ oxyanion terminations permit MXene ink to exhibit remarkable self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability in an aqueous solution, without any additives. This strategy can extend the shelf life of MXene to five months and enable the fabrication of high&#8208;performance, customizable supercapacitors through solution processing, unlocking its potential applications in flexible electronics.







Abstract
The solution processing of MXene ink is the feasible strategy to realize its state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. Nevertheless, achieving high stability and processability of additive&#8208;free MXene ink is particularly challenging. Herein, we propose an oxyanion&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene ink that exhibits excellent self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability. The vertex&#8208;connected polyhedrons of oxyanions capping on the Ti3C2 host serve as an in situ antioxidative shield, effectively preventing the attack of free H2O molecules while increasing the robustness of the Ti&#8722;C bond and reducing the susceptibility of surface Ti atoms to oxidation. Consequently, the shelf life of MXene ink can be extended up to 5&#8197;months at room temperature. Moreover, the high electron accumulation of oxyanions enhances the interlayer interactions among MXene sheets through electrostatic binding, which enables the formation of stable and uniform MXene inks with controlled rheological properties and processability. Inspired by Chinese calligraphy, we utilize the oxyanion&#8208;terminated MXene ink to fabricate high&#8208;performance and customizable paper supercapacitors, which exhibit exceptional flexibility and stability, allowing them to be tailored to desired capacity, stretchability, and shapes. This in situ surface chemistry strategy of oxyanions can activate the self&#8208;antioxidant capability and solution processability of MXene, paving the way for its widespread applications in flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>Stable Mono&#8208;Radical and Triplet Diradicals Based on Allylic Radical&#8208;Embedded All&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The derivative of an allylic radical&#8208;embedded all&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbon (dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene) was synthesized, which showed high stability due to captodative effect and desired high&#8208;spin triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high&#8208;spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open&#8208;shell all&#8208;benzenoid PHs: benzo[fg]tetracene (1) and dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene (2). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical 2 showing a half&#8208;life of up to 17.2&#8197;days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that 1 and 2 predominantly feature Clar's aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound 2 was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements.

&lt;p&gt;The derivative of an allylic radical-embedded all-benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbon (dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;fg&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;lm&lt;/i&gt;]heptacene) was synthesized, which showed high stability due to captodative effect and desired high-spin triplet ground state with a large singlet-triplet energy gap.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high-spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high-spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open-shell all-benzenoid PHs: benzo[&lt;i&gt;fg&lt;/i&gt;]tetracene (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;fg&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;lm&lt;/i&gt;]heptacene (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; showing a half-life of up to 17.2&#8197;days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; predominantly feature Clar's aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements.

         <title>Regulating the Spin&#8208;State of Cobalt in Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Iodine Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. The CoIII (with an S=0 spin ground state) coordinated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) effectively address the slow kinetics of I2 to NaI, resulting in large reversible capacities and superior high&#8208;rate cycling stability.







Abstract
Although the catalytic activity is heavily reliant on the electronic structure of the catalyst, understanding the impact of electron spin regulation on electrocatalytic performance is still rarely investigated. This work presents a novel approach involving the single&#8208;atom coordination of cobalt (Co) within metalloporphyrin&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) to facilitate the catalytic conversion for sodium&#8208;iodine batteries. The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that CoII and CoIII are incorporated into the 3D&#8208;COFs, exhibiting spin ground states of S=1/2 and S=0, respectively. The low spin state of CoIII is favorable to hybridize with the sp 3d orbitals of I3&#8722;, thus facilitating the conversion of I3&#8722; to I&#8722;. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the presence of CoIII enhances iodide adsorption and accelerates the formation of NaI in 3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII, thereby promoting its rapid kinetic behaviors. Notably, the I2@3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII cathode achieves a high reversible capacity of 227.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C and demonstrates exceptional cyclic stability, exceeding 2000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;C with a minor capacity fading rate of less than one 0.01&#8201;% per cycle.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicon in Si3Cu3&#8722; Cluster</title>

Photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations identified the global minimum structure of the 16&#8208;valence electron Si3Cu3&#8722; cluster, characterized by a planar tetracoordinate silicon atom within a rhombic framework of alternating Si3 and Cu3 units. The stability is reinforced by a delocalized 3&#8208;center 2&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;bond in the Cu3 unit and a &#960;&#8208;bond within the Si3 framework. This study provides experimental confirmation of a planar hypercoordinate Group 14 element.







Abstract
Photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations have identified the global minimum structure of the 16&#8208;valence electron Si3Cu3&#8722; cluster, which features a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) in a rhombic arrangement. The Si3 and Cu3 triangles are interconnected by a Si2/Cu2 edge, forming an ordered chain&#8208;like structure. Besides the conventional 2c&#8211;2e &#963;&#8208;bond connecting Si3 and Cu3, the stability of this cluster is reinforced by a delocalized 3c&#8211;2e &#963;&#8208;bond in Cu3 and a &#960;&#8208;bond in Si3. Our study provides experimental confirmation of a planar hypercoordinate heavier Group 14 element, opening possibilities for exploring similar structures in two&#8208;dimensional materials.

This study examines the viability of competing inner&#8208;sphere (ISET) and outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer (OSET) processes in [Cu(dap)2]+&#8208;mediated atom&#8208;transfer radical additions of olefins and CF3SO2Cl that can deliver both R&#8722;SO2Cl and R&#8722;Cl products. R&#8722;SO2Cl/R&#8722;Cl product ratios are primarily governed by the relative rates of ground state direct catalyst regeneration {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++R&#8901;} and ligand exchange {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++Cl&#8722; }.







Abstract
This integrated computational and experimental study comprehensively examines the viability of competing inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer (ISET) and outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer (OSET) processes in [Cu(dap)2]+&#8208;mediated atom&#8208;transfer radical additions (ATRA) of olefins and CF3SO2Cl that can deliver both R&#8722;SO2Cl and R&#8722;Cl products. Five sterically&#8208; and electronically&#8208;varied representative alkenes were selected from which to explore and reconcile a range of experimentally observed outcomes. Findings are consistent with photoexcited [Cu(dap)2]+ initiating photoelectron transfer via ISET and the subsequent regeneration of the oxidized catalyst via ISET in the ground state to close the catalytic cycle and liberate products. R&#8722;SO2Cl/R&#8722;Cl product ratios appear to be primarily governed by the relative rates of direct catalyst regeneration {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++R&#8901;} and ligand exchange {i.e., [Cu(dap)2SO2Cl]&#8901;++Cl&#8722; }. Through this work, a more consistent and more complete conceptual framework has been developed to better understand this chemistry and how catalyst regeneration occurs. It is this important ground state process, which closes the catalytic cycle, and ultimately controls the enantioselectivity of ATRA reactions employing chiral copper photocatalysts.

         <title>Building Asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3 Bridge between 2D Photocatalyst and Co&#8208;catalyst for Directed Charge Transfer toward Efficient H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

We report a strategy of forming asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3 units that can bridge nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon layers with polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (C3N4&#8722;Zn&#8722;N(C)). The symmetry&#8208;breaking Zn&#8722;N3 moiety, which has an asymmetric local charge distribution, enables directed and efficient interfacial charge transfer between the C3N4 photocatalyst and the N&#8208;doped carbon cocatalyst to achieve dramatically enhanced H2O2 photosynthesis activity.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymeric semiconductors are a class of promising photocatalysts; however, it remains challenging to facilitate their interlayer charge transfer for suppressed in&#8208;plane charge recombination and thus improved quantum efficiency. Although some strategies, such as &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and van der Waals interaction, have been developed so far, directed interlayer charge transfer still cannot be achieved. Herein, we report a strategy of forming asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3 units that can bridge nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon layers with polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (C3N4&#8722;Zn&#8722;N(C)) to address this challenge. The symmetry&#8208;breaking Zn&#8722;N3 moiety, which has an asymmetric local charge distribution, enables directed interfacial charge transfer between the C3N4 photocatalyst and the N&#8208;doped carbon co&#8208;catalyst. As evidenced by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, charge separation can be significantly enhanced by the interfacial asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3 bonding bridges. As a result, the designed C3N4&#8722;Zn&#8722;N(C) catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 photosynthesis activity, outperforming most of the reported C3N4&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of tailoring interfacial chemical bonding channels in polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to achieve effective spatial charge separation.

         <title>An Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Supramolecular Modulator Enhancing Autophagy to Prevent Ventricular Arrhythmias Post&#8208;Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;activated Ru(II) supramolecular sonosensitizer, RuB, was developed to modulate ventricular arrhythmias. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrated RuB mediated US modulation effectively enhanced pro&#8208;survival autophagy in BV2 cells, thereby prevented ventricular arrhythmias.







Abstract
Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) triggered by myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading cause of sudden cardiac mortality worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies for managing MI&#8208;induced VAs, such as left stellate ganglion resection and ablation, are suboptimal, highlighting the need to explore safer and more effective intervention strategies. Herein, we rationally designed two supramolecular sonosensitizers RuA and RuB, engineered through acceptor modification to generate moderate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to modulate VAs. Both RuA and RuB demonstrated high ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated ROS production efficiency, with singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) of 0.70 and 0.88, respectively, surpassing ligand IR1105 and the conventional sonosensitizer ICG (&#934;&#916;=0.40). In vitro, RuB, at a modest concentration and under US intensity notably boosts pro&#8208;survival autophagy in microglia BV2&#8197;cell. To improve in vivo stability and biocompatibility, RuB was further encapsulated into DSPE&#8208;PEG5000 to prepare RuB nanoparticles (RuB NPs). In vivo studies after microinjection of RuB NPs into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and subsequent US exposure, demonstrated that RuB NPs&#8208;mediated US modulation effectively suppresses sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) and inflammatory responses, thereby preventing VAs. Importantly, no tissue injury was observed post RuB NPs&#8208;mediated US modulation. This work pioneers the design of long&#8208;wave emission supramolecular sonosensitizers, offering new insights into regulating cardiovascular diseases.

         <title>Marine Amoebae&#8208;Inspired Salting Hydrogels to Reconfigure Anisotropy for Reprogrammable Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to osmotic pressure, marine amoebae swell in freshwater and deswell in high salinity seawater. Inspired by this, protonation/deprotonation transition was synergized with osmotic pressure to allow polyampholyte hydrogels to swell&#8208;reswell&#8208;deswell upon successive immersion in HCl/NaCl solution and water. Swelling&#8208;reswelling&#8208;deswelling of reconfigurable patterned zones enables reprogrammable shape morphing of hydrogels.







Abstract
Reprogrammable shape morphing is ubiquitous in living beings and highly crucial for them to move in normal situations, even to survive under dangerous conditions. There is increasing interest in using asymmetric hydrogel structures to understand and mimic living beings&#8217; shape morphing upon an external trigger in a controlled way. However, these asymmetric or heterogeneous configurations cannot be further modified once the polymer hydrogels are prepared. Therefore, it is a great challenge to achieve reprogrammable shape morphing using the existing hydrogels. Inspired by marine amoebae, which transform into several different morphologies according to the various external salt concentrations, a new strategy is developed for salting hydrogels to reconfigure their anisotropy toward reprogrammable shape morphing. Polyampholyte hydrogels with equal stoichiometric COO&#8722; and N+(CH3)3 groups were first swollen in HCl/NaCl solution. After being then transferred into water, they first swollen again by water uptake driven by the osmotic pressure, and then were spontaneously deswollen due to increase in internal pH and dialysis of ions leading to deprotonation of COOH to COO&#8722; and regeneration of COO&#8722;/N+(CH3)3 electrostatic attraction. This work provides a novel strategy to reconfigure anisotropy of hydrogel soft actuators and to open up an avenue for reprogrammable shape morphing.

         <title>Chiral Au@CeO2 Helical Nanorods with Spatially Separated Structures for Polarization&#8208;Dependent N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the successful development of chiral Au@CeO2 HNRs featuring spatially separated structures, achieved via a wet&#8208;chemistry approach. This advancement significantly boosts the photocatalytic efficiency of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials and highlights their promising application in N2 photofixation when stimulated by circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Chiral photocatalytic nanomaterials possess numerous unique properties and hold promise for various applications in chemical synthesis, environmental protection, energy conversion, and photoelectric devices. Nevertheless, it is uncommon to develop effective means to enhance the asymmetric catalytic performances of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials. In this study, a type of L/D&#8208;Au@CeO2 helical nanorods (HNRs) was fabricated by selectively growing CeO2 on the surface of Au HNRs via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry construction method. Chiral Au@CeO2 HNRs, featuring Au and CeO2 with spatially separated structures, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance for N2 fixation, being 50.80&#177;2.64&#8197;times greater than that of Au HNRs. Furthermore, when L&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs were exposed to left circularly polarized light (CPL) and D&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs were exposed to right CPL, their photocatalytic efficiency was enhanced by 3.06&#177;0.06&#8197;times compared to the samples illuminated with the opposite CPL, which can be attributed to the asymmetrical generation of hot carriers upon CPL excitation. This study not only offers a simple approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials but also demonstrates the potential of chiral plasmonic materials for application in specific photocatalytic reactions, such as N2 fixation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;N Coordination in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Inhibiting Catalyst Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni catalyst readily react with S8 to form NiSx compounds on the surface, leading to catalyst passivation and slows down kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Conversely, Ni&#8722;N coordination catalyst, usually as Ni&#8722;N4, offers effective passivation resistance and rapid LiPSs conversion kinetics. Preventing S passivation in M&#8722;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8722;N4 but also to various transition metals and coordination numbers of N.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries exhibit great potential as the next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. Application of catalyst is widely adopted to accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion reactions and improve battery performance. Although significant attention has been devoted to seeking new catalysts, the problem of catalyst passivation remains underexplored. Herein, we find that metal&#8208;N coordination has a previously overlooked role in preventing the catalyst passivation. In the case of nickel, the Ni catalyst reacts with S8 to produce NiSx compounds on the surface, leading to catalyst passivation and slow the kinetics of LiPSs conversion. In contrast, when Ni is coordinated with N (typically Ni&#8722;N4), S8 remains stable on the surface. The Ni&#8722;N4 exhibits excellent resistance to passivation and rapid kinetics of LiPSs conversion. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with Ni&#8722;N4 exhibits a high rate capability of 604.11&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;C and maintains a low capacity decay rate of 0.046&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C. Furthermore, preventing S passivation in M&#8722;N coordination applies not only to Ni&#8722;N4 but also to various coordination numbers and transition metals. This study reveals a new aspect of metal&#8208;N coordination in inhibiting catalyst passivation, improving our understanding of catalysts in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Shotgun Sequencing of 512&#8208;mer Copolyester Allows Random Access to Stored Information</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated shotgun sequencing of 512 repeating unit sequence&#8208;defined polymers with a molecular weight (57.3&#8197;kDa) far exceeding the analysis limit of mass spectrometry. Chemically activated fragmentation code was employed to generate MS&#8208;compatible oligomers. Shotgun sequencing also allowed random access to the stored information.







Abstract
Digital information encoded in polymers has been exclusively decoded by mass spectrometry. However, the size limit of analytes in mass spectrometry restricts the storage capacity per chain. In addition, sequential decoding hinders random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing. Here we report the shotgun sequencing of a 512&#8208;mer sequence&#8208;defined polymer whose molecular weight (57.3&#8197;kDa) far exceeds the analytical limit of mass spectrometry. A 4&#8208;bit fragmentation code was implemented at aperiodic positions during the synthetic encoding of 512&#8208;bit information without affecting storage capacity per chain. Upon activating the fragmentation code, the polymer chain splits into 18 oligomers, which could be individually decoded by tandem&#8208;mass sequencing. These sequences were computationally reconstructed into a full sequence using an error&#8208;detection method. The proposed sequencing method eliminates the storage limit of a single polymer chain and allows random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Star&#8208;Shape Giant Trimer Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy has developed novel non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shaped trimer, which has significantly improved solubility and synthetic yield, and effectively inhibited excessive molecular aggregation. The resulting based on 3BTT6F exhibit superior photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the non&#8208;fused 3D skeleton is conducive to improving intermolecular interactions, thereby contributing to the exceptional stability of the binary devices.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operation stability. However, the large conjugated plane of GMAs poses great challenges in regulating the solubility, over&#8208;size aggregation and yield, which in turn further constrains their development in commercial products. Herein, we employ a non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy to develop novel non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers (3BTT6F and 3BTT6Cl) for improving device performance. Single&#8208;bond linkage can break the rigid planarity to form a 3D architecture, generating multidimensional charge transfer pathways. Importantly, the non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy can not only significantly improve solubility and synthesis yield, but also effectively suppress molecular excessive aggregation. Consequently, due to the optimized film&#8208;forming process and charge dynamics, 3BTT6F&#8208;based binary device obtains a high PCE of 17.52&#8201;%, which is significantly higher than the reported fully fused trimers. Excitingly, 3BTT6F&#8208;based ternary device even obtains a top&#8208;level PCE of 19.26&#8201;%. Furthermore, the non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape configuration also endows these acceptors with enhanced intermolecular interaction in the active layer, demonstrating excellent operational stability. Our work emphasizes the potential of non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers, providing a new pathway for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs.

Override the intrinsic preference of regioselectivity. An enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones is reported to access alkenyl cyclobutanols. A carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation step is the key to override the intrinsic electronic effect guided regioselectivity. The products are demonstrated to readily advance to enantioenriched three&#8208;dimensional bioisosteres.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of (spiro)cyclobutane derivatives poses significant challenges yet holds promising applications for both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. We report here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric syn&#8208;hydrometalative 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of 1,4&#8208;alkynones to synthesize alkenyl cyclobutanols with a tetrasubstituted stereocenter. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, delivering a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing rigid (spiro)carbocycle skeletons in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 84&#8201;% yield and 98.5&#8201;:&#8201;1.5 er). The synthetic utility is demonstrated through stereospecific transformations into fused spiro molecules. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is initiated by an active Ni&#8722;H species, with carbonyl&#8208;directed hydrometalation as the key for regioselective control. This catalytic method provides a general solution for regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes and represents an efficient reaction pattern for assembling highly strained enantioenriched bioisosteres.

The stereocontrolled hydrogenation of ketones by dual iridium catalysis was demonstrated. The finding that N,P&#8722;Ir (active towards alkenes) and NHC,P&#8722;Ir (active towards ketones) can perform the asymmetric hydrogenation under the same conditions (solvent, pH, hydrogen source) while exhibited complementary chemoselectivity was key to the development of this methodology. By simple choice of chirality on each iridium complex, each stereoisomer of the alcohol could separately be prepared with precise control over the absolute stereochemistry.







Abstract
The concept of dual catalysis is an emerging area holding high potential in terms of preparative efficiency, yet faces severe challenges in compatibility of reaction conditions and interference of catalysts. The transition&#8208;metal catalyzed stereoselective hydrogenation of olefins and ketones typically proceeds under different reaction conditions and/or uses a different reductant. As a result, these two types of hydrogenations can normally not be performed in the same pot. Herein, the stereocontrolled hydrogenation of enones to saturated alcohols is described, enabled by orthogonal dual iridium catalysis, using molecular hydrogen for both reductions. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, N,P&#8208;iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards olefins) and NHC,P&#8208;iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards ketones) operated independently of one another allowing the construction of two contiguous stereogenic centers up to 99&#8201;% ee, 99/1 d.r. Ultimately, by simple selection of the chirality of either ligands, the enone could be efficiently reduced to all four stereoisomers of the saturated alcohol in equally high stereopurity. This degree of stereocontrol for the synthesis of different stereoisomers by dual transition&#8208;metal catalyzed hydrogenation was previously not attained. The generality in substituted enones (alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl) demonstrate the wide applicability of this concept.

&lt;p&gt;The concept of dual catalysis is an emerging area holding high potential in terms of preparative efficiency, yet faces severe challenges in compatibility of reaction conditions and interference of catalysts. The transition-metal catalyzed stereoselective hydrogenation of olefins and ketones typically proceeds under different reaction conditions and/or uses a different reductant. As a result, these two types of hydrogenations can normally not be performed in the same pot. Herein, the stereocontrolled hydrogenation of enones to saturated alcohols is described, enabled by orthogonal dual iridium catalysis, using molecular hydrogen for both reductions. In this one-pot procedure, N,P-iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards olefins) and NHC,P-iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards ketones) operated independently of one another allowing the construction of two contiguous stereogenic centers up to 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, 99/1 d.r.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Stabilized Single CoN4Cl2 Site Boosts Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into Tunable Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Co&#8722;N4Cl2 single&#8208;site was fabricated on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via molecule modulation and exhibited high efficiency in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion into syngas, showing a high production rate, TON, and TOF. The triazine&#8208;based COF framework promotes the charge kinetics and the single Co&#8722;N4Cl2 site strengthens the CO2 activation by reducing the activation energy towards the key intermediate *COOH.







Abstract
Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co&#8722;N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Co enabled a record&#8208;high CO production rate of 426&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;1&#8201;:&#8201;16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine&#8208;based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co&#8722;N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.

A unique Ag&#8722;Ru dual active center alloying strategy was employed to synthesize the CoCuFeAgRu HEA using MOF&#8208;assisted preparation. Remarkably, the resulting HEA catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, and the assembled flexible rechargeable ZAB also demonstrated exceptional performance at ultra&#8208;low temperatures of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with a cycle stability of up to 1,650&#8197;hours. This study presents a novel approach for advancing efficient bifunctional catalysis of HEAs.







Abstract
The development of advanced bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a unique dual active center alloying strategy is proposed to achieve the efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis, and the high entropy effect is further exploited to modulate the structure and performance of the catalysts. The MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;alloying method was employed to construct the CoCuFeAgRu high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA), which are uniformly anchored in porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets. Notably, the obtained HEA catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both ORR and OER, and a peak power density of 136. 53&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an energy density of 987.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1, surpassing the most of the previously reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Moreover, the assembled flexible rechargeable ZAB enables excellent performance even at the ultralow temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with an energy density of 601.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1 and remarkable cycling stability up to 1,650&#8197;hours. Combined experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of the HEA catalyst originated from the synergistic effect of the Ag and Ru dual active centers, and the optimization of the electronic structure by alloying effect.

Exploring efficient formation mechanisms, as well as self&#8208;renewing solid electrolyte interfaces, is essential for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This paper proposes a novel and straightforward method for forming the interface, introducing an organic&#8211;inorganic composite solid&#8208;to&#8208;gel electrolyte layer with high mechanical performance. The self&#8208;renovating mechanism is also discussed, which may accelerate the practical application of self&#8208;renovating interface in the field of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIB) have emerged as a promising technology in the realm of electrochemical energy storage. Despite its potential advantages in terms of safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and inherent safety, AZIB faces significant challenges. Issues attributed to unsupported thermodynamics and non&#8208;uniform potential distribution and deposition, present formidable obstacles that necessitate resolution. To tackle these challenges, a novel strategy adapting hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic in&#8197;situ derived solid&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel electrolyte interface (StHEI) has been developed from coordination reactions and self&#8208;respiratory process, establishing uniform diffusion channels by ion bridges and accelerating ion transport. Self&#8208;respiratory pattern of StHEI realized through in&#8197;situ inorganic component conversion further prolongs the protecting duration, which effectively mitigates corrosion and passivation but enhance the mechanical properties of the StHEI measured through Young's modulus. This novel StHEI promotes well&#8208;distributed potential lines within the Helmholtz regions. Zn2+ are finally induced to deposit and nucleate in a compact, fine, and uniform manner. Asymmetrical batteries assembled with the modified Zn electrode and bare Zn exhibit exceptional stability over 3000&#8197;h (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The asymmetrical Cu//Zn cell achieved an outstanding average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% over 1200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation of Organic and Inorganic Components in Interphase by Fiber Separator for High&#8208;Stable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidized cellulose separator provides strong dipole moments, facilitating the cleavage of P&#8722;F bonds to construct a solid electrolyte interphase rich in NaF. In addition, the separator prevents the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. Thus, it results in a smooth and robust interphase, which significantly reduces the interface impedance of the Na anode.







Abstract
Uncontrollable side reactions at the metal interface have been identified as the root cause of the formation of a fragile solid electrolyte interphase, leading to irreversible sodium loss in sodium metal batteries. Here, we proposed an interface engineering strategy that employed a carboxyl functionalized cellulose separator to provide strong dipole moments and induce the cleavage of P&#8722;F bond to construct a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in NaF. In addition, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance technology confirmed that the separator with strong dipole moments prevented the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. SEI with high NaF content and few oligomers is smooth and robust, obviously decreasing the interface impedance of the Na anode. The symmetric Na||Na cells, equipped with the functionalized separator, efficiently operated for 1400&#8197;hours with a stable 72&#8197;mV overpotential at 0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, exhibiting low energy barrier and fast ion transport kinetics. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell also showed stable cycling performance, with the capacity remaining at 94.83&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1C. The proposed separator could control the formation and composition of SEI, paving the way for the development of long&#8208;life sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Triple Regulations via Fe Redox Boosting Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>

The performance of low&#8208;valence Fe doped Ni2P toward NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 is significantly enhanced via the three regulations of Fe through bypassing the rate&#8208;determining NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; step, reducing the NO2&#8722; to NH3 reaction energy barrier, and prohibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) has promising prospects for green synthesis of ammonia and environmental remediation. However, the performance of catalysts at high current density usually suffers from the high energy barrier for the nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to nitrite (NO2&#8722;) and the competitive hydrogen evolution. Herein, we proposed a two&#8208;step relay mechanism through spontaneous redox reaction followed electrochemical reaction by introducing low&#8208;valence Fe species into Ni2P nanosheets to significantly enhance the NO3&#8722;RR performance at industrial current density. The existence of low&#8208;valence Fe species bypasses the NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; step through the spontaneous redox with NO3&#8722; to produce NO2&#8722; and Fe2O3, regulates the electronic structure of Ni2P to reduce the barrier of NO2&#8722; to NH3, thirdly prohibits the hydrogen evolution by consuming the excess active hydrogen through reduction of Fe2O3 to recover low&#8208;valence Fe species. The triple regulations via Fe redox during the two&#8208;step relay reactions guarantee the Fe&#8208;Ni2P@NF high ammonia yield of 120.1&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with Faraday efficiency of more than 90% over a wide potential window and a long&#8208;term stability of more than 130 h at ~1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new strategy to realize the design and synthesis of nitrate reduction electrocatalysts at high current densities.

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Programmable DNA&#8208;Encoded Pre&#8208;PROTACs for Cell&#8208;Selective and Controlled Protein Degradation</title>

         <dc:description>
A phototunable miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform is developed to achieve on&#8208;demand activation and termination of targeted protein degradation in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. This modular scaffold capitalizes on the programmability of DNA assembly for dynamic regulation of diverse miRiaTACs for enhanced cancer therapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have accelerated drug development; however, some challenges still exist owing to their lack of tumor selectivity and on&#8208;demand protein degradation. Here, we developed a miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform that enables the on&#8208;demand activation and termination of target degradation in a cell type&#8208;specific manner. Using miRNA&#8208;21 as a model, we engineered DNA hairpins labeled with JQ&#8208;1 and pomalidomide and facilitated the modular assembly of DNA&#8208;encoded pre&#8208;PROTACs through a hybridization chain reaction. This configuration promoted the selective polyubiquitination and degradation of BRD4 upon miR&#8208;21 initiation, highlighting significant tumor selectivity and minimal systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the platform incorporates photolabile groups, enabling the precise optical control of pre&#8208;PROTACs during DNA assembly/disassembly, mitigating the risk of excessive protein degradation. Additionally, by introducing a secondary ligand targeting CDK6, these pre&#8208;PROTACs were used as a modular scaffold for the programmable assembly of active miRiaTACs containing two different warheads in exact stoichiometry, enabling orthogonal multitarget degradation. The integration of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy through an upconversion nanosystem further enhanced the efficacy of the platform with potent in vivo anticancer activity. We anticipate that miRiaTAC represents a significant intersection between dynamic DNA nanotechnology and PROTAC, potentially expanding the versatility of PROTAC toolkit for cancer therapy.

         <title>Oxygen Plasma Triggered Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe Motif in Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe local motifs can be constructed in CoFe Prussian blue analogues by oxygen plasma treatment, realizing the oxygen evolution pathway from traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism, which successfully balances the activity and stability for the industrial&#8208;level current density alkaline water oxidation.







Abstract
In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high&#8208;valence transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high&#8208;valence metal sites, particularly in high&#8208;current&#8208;density water&#8208;splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt&#8208;iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double&#8208;exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valence Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low&#8208;valence state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30) requires an overpotential of only 276&#8197;mV to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.76&#8197;V and continuously operates for 250&#8197;hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.

Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe-PBA-30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.76&#8197;V and continuously operates for 250&#8197;hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Alkynyl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl amides are important components in organic synthesis of bioactive compounds and valuable heterocycles. General and efficient syntheses without transition&#8208;metals under mild and simple conditions are rare. Introduced are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot syntheses of alkynyl amide that make the alkyne triple bond from chemical feedstocks. These innovative methods significantly reduce costs and enhance the sustainability of alkynyl amide syntheses.







Abstract
Alkynyl amides play crucial roles in organic synthesis in the production of bioactive compounds and valuable heterocycles. Despite numerous studies on their synthesis, challenges persist due to the necessity of harsh or hazardous conditions and the use of costly or unstable reagents. Herein, we present a one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of all three bonds of the alkyne under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. An important feature of this chemistry is the use of readily available feedstock chemicals, such as methyl esters and acetamides. This approach offers efficient access to a wide range of aryl and alkyl alkynyl amides and demonstrates excellent tolerance towards various functional groups in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner.

         <title>End&#8208;Extended Conjugation Strategy to Reduce the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Mechanical Robustness Gap in Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the end&#8208;extended conjugation strategy, high efficiency, excellent thermal stability, and outstanding mechanical robustness of APSCs are simultaneously achieved. These devices maintain 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE for 1500&#8197;h at 65&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit a high COS value of 24.1&#8201;%, and achieve a record&#8208;breaking PCE of 19.12&#8201;% (certified at 18.45&#8201;%).







Abstract
Concurrently achieving high efficiency, mechanical robustness and thermal stability is critical for the commercialization of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (APSCs). However, APSCs usually demonstrate complicated morphology, primarily attributed to the polymer chain entanglement which has a detrimental effect on their fill factors (FF) and morphology stability. To address these concerns, an end&#8208;group extended polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;NFT, was synthesized and studied. The morphology analysis showed a tightly ordered molecular packing mode and a favorable phase separation was formed. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;NFT&#8208;based device achieved an exceptional PCE of 19.12&#8201;% (certified as 18.45&#8201;%), outperforming the control PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;FT devices (17.14&#8201;%). This significant improvement highlights the record&#8208;high PCE for binary APSCs. The thermal aging study revealed that the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;NFT blend exhibited excellent morphological stability, thereby achieving superior device stability, retaining 90&#8201;% of initial efficiency after enduring thermal stress (65&#8201;&#176;C) for 1500&#8197;hours. More importantly, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;NFT blend film exhibited outstanding mechanical ductility with a crack onset strain of 24.1&#8201;%. Overall, rational chemical structure innovation, especially the conjugation extension strategy to trigger appropriate phase separation and stable morphology, is the key to achieving high efficiency, improved thermal stability and robust mechanical stability of APSCs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Component High&#8208;Resolution Dual&#8208;Tone EUV Photoresists Based on Precision Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;component, discrete self&#8208;immolative photoresists with precisely defined chain lengths are engineered as dual&#8208;tone patterning materials suitable for both electron beam and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. These discrete photoresists showcase a chain length&#8208;dependent lithographic performance, resulting in well&#8208;delineated patterns with superior resolution and reduced line edge roughness (LER) when compared to their disperse counterparts.







Abstract
Electron beam (EB) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography are advanced techniques capable of achieving sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm resolutions, critical for fabricating next&#8208;generation nanostructures and semiconductor devices. However, developing EUV photoresists that meet all demands for resolution, line edge roughness (LER), and sensitivity (RLS) remains a significant challenge. Herein, we introduce high&#8208;performance photoresists based on single&#8208;component self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) with inherent signal amplification via cascade degradation. These SIPs function as dual&#8208;tone photoresists under both EB and EUV lithography, with performance primarily determined by the exposure dose. Lithographic evaluations show that discrete SIPs provide significant improvements over disperse counterparts, achieving higher resolution and reduced LER. Specifically, a discrete SIP with a DP of 12 produces a line&#8208;space pattern with a resolution of approximately 18&#8197;nm and an LER of 1.8&#8197;nm, compared to 21&#8197;nm resolution and 2.5&#8197;nm LER for disperse SIPs. Additionally, these SIP&#8208;based photoresists, enriched with aromatic structures, exhibit excellent etch resistance. The single&#8208;component nature and potential to address the RLS trade&#8208;off underscore the promise of discrete SIPs for EUV lithography.

         <title>Organic Materials with Ultrabright Phosphorescence at Room Temperature under Physiological Conditions for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The record NIR/red phosphorescence intensity of nanoparticles under physiological conditions has been achieved by four&#8208;branched luminogens with shielding effect toward oxygen and water. It can penetrate tissue with depth as high as 35&#8197;mm, resulting in the clear in vivo phosphorescence imaging of the liver, tumor, and stomach in living mice, and lymph nodes in living rabbits with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios.







Abstract
In contrast to the high efficiency of room temperature phosphorescence in crystal states, the generally utilized nanoparticles of organic materials in bioimaging demonstrated sharply decreased performance by orders of magnitude under physiological conditions, badly limiting the realization of their unique advantages. This case, especially for organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence materials, is not only the challenge present in reality but more importantly, for the theoretical problem of deeply understanding and avoiding the quenching effect by oxygen and water toward excited triplet states. Herein, thanks to the intelligent molecular design by the introduction of abundant hydrophobic chains and highly&#8208;branched structures, bright and persistent red/NIR phosphorescence under physiological conditions has been realized, which demonstrated the shielding effect towards oxygen, and the strengthened intermolecular interactions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative transitions. Accordingly, the record phosphorescence intensity of nanoparticles in bioimage, up to 8.21&#177;0.36&#215;108&#8197;p&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;sr&#8722;1, was achieved, to realize the clear phosphorescence imaging of liver and tumors in living mice, even lymph nodes in rabbit models with high SBRs. This work afforded an efficient way to achieve the bright red/NIR phosphorescence nanoparticles, guiding their further applications in biology and medicine.

         <title>Meso/Microporous Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Featuring Curved Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ZnO&#8208;assisted ZIF derivation approach is developed to synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C catalyst with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites onto the tubular carbon walls, showing excellent oxygen reduction performance in both acidic and alkaline media. When used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries, it demonstrates outstanding cell/battery performance.







Abstract
Zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are among the most efficient precursors for the synthesis of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N/C materials, which are promising catalysts for enhancing the performance of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) and proton exchange fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, existing ZIF&#8208;derived Fe&#8722;N/C electrocatalysts mostly consist of microporous materials, leading to insufficient mass transport and inadequate battery/cell performance. In this study, we synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C material with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites, denoted as FeSA&#8722;N/TC, through the pyrolysis of hemin&#8208;modified ZIF films on ZnO nanorods, obtained from the self&#8208;assembly reaction between Zn2+ from ZnO hydrolysis and 2&#8208;methylimidazole. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites can weaken the intermediate adsorptions, resulting in lower free energy barriers and enhanced performance during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, FeSA&#8722;N/TC exhibits exceptional ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.925&#8197;V in alkaline media and 0.825&#8197;V in acidic media. When used as the cathodic catalyst in PEMFCs and ZABs, FeSA&#8722;N/TC achieves high peak power densities (H2&#8722;O2 PEMFC: 1100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; H2&#8722;Air PEMFC: 715&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; liquid&#8208;state ZAB: 228&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; solid&#8208;state ZAB: 112&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency in practical applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Tuning Metallic Sites in Molecular Complexes for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
Heterogenized molecular complexes were designed via coordinating Fe&#8722;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands for electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis verify that the ligands&#8208;tuning strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between molecular complexes and carbon support renders the charge accumulation on Fe&#8722;Ni sites through fast electron transfer, following by the reconstruction of active Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni centers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic hybrid catalysts with highly tunable single&#8208;sites are promising for oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER), but molecular&#8208;scale understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms still remain elusive on these bulk materials. Herein, we report a direct construction of heterogenized molecular complexes stabilized on carbon substrates via coordinating Fe&#8722;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands (FeNi&#8208;Lx). The ligands&#8208;tuning &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between aromatic carboxylate ligands and carbon supports promote the oxidative charge accumulation on Fe&#8722;Ni sites via fast electron transferring, thus the optimized FeNi&#8208;Lx rendering a mass activity of 6680&#8197;A&#8201;gFe/Ni&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;V overpotential. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the OH&#8722; nucleophilic attack on hypervalent iron sites induce the reconstruction of active Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni species, accompanying with fast valence increasing. Whereas, during OER, the unexpected valence reduction of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Ni sites would be attributed to the oxygen&#8208;generating from OOH* intermediates. These findings would establish an essential understanding of the origin of active centers in molecular complexes catalysts for oxygen&#8208;evolution.

         <title>Polyoxometalates&#8208;Mediated Selectivity in Pt Single&#8208;Atoms on Ceria for Environmental Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the electronic and geometric structure of active sites helps heterogeneous catalysts to promote their performance. We found a polyoxometalates&#8208;mediated electronic interaction (PMEI) effect in CeO2 supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which simultaneously reduced the electron density of Pt SAs and enhanced the acidity of catalysts. Such PMEI effect enables Pt&#8208;CeO2 SACs in selective catalysis with respect to environment protection.







Abstract
Optimizing the reactivity and selectivity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a crucial yet challenging issue in heterogeneous catalysis. This study demonstrates selective catalysis facilitated by a polyoxometalates&#8208;mediated electronic interaction (PMEI) in a Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on CeO2 modified with Keggin&#8208;type phosphotungstate acid (HPW), labeled as Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW. The PMEI effect originates from the unique arrangement of isolated Pt atoms and HPW clusters on the CeO2 support. Electrons are transferred from the ceria support to the electrophilic tungsten in HPW clusters, and subsequently, Pt atoms donate electrons to the now electron&#8208;deficient ceria. This phenomenon enhances the positive charge of Pt atoms, moderating O2 activation and limiting lattice oxygen mobility compared to the conventional Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The resulting electronic structure of Pt combined with the strong and local acidic environment of HPW on Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW leads to improved efficiency and N2 selectivity in the degradation of NH3 and NO, as well as increased CO2 yield when inputting volatile organic compounds. This study sheds the light on the design of SACs with balanced reactivity and selectivity for environmental catalysis.

         <title>Creating Spin Channels in SrCoO3 through Trigonal&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Structural Transformation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of trigonal SrCoO2.5 into cubic SrCoO3 establishes spin&#8208;polarized electron channels, significantly enhancing oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR). The cubic phase's superior electron transport and ferromagnetic properties reduce overpotential at high current densities, offering key insights into the role of spin dynamics in catalytic processes.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscopy, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70&#8197;mV at 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.

         <title>Inside Cover: Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 3/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton intercalation of Mo3Nb2O14 bronze occurs with near&#8208;zero volume change, which arises from rotation and shrinkage of the flexible MOn framework (M = Mo, Nb) as reported by Kosuke Kawai et al. in their Research Article (e202410971). As a result, the Mo3Nb2O14 particle maintains high crystallinity after repeating proton (de)intercalation, which contributes to high Coulombic efficiency and long&#8208;term charge/discharge operation of an aqueous proton battery.

A challenging activation of the Si&#8211;F &#963;&#8211;bond was successfully achieved using bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids. This innovative three&#8208;component coupling reaction, involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides, provides a direct route to diverse ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions, as reported by Seo&#8208;Jung Han and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202413759).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;Small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 3/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, they have not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2&#8197;nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. In their Research Article (e202410109), Zhikun Wu, Jun Yang, Lingwen Liao et al. report a novel nanocluster with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB, and demonstrate the effectiveness of manipulating GBs for enhancing the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts.

Puzzling of ligands at C(0): In their Research Article (e202415228), Max M. Hansmann et&#8197;al. demonstrate a new strategy to afford stable diazoalkenes by cleavage of a carbophosphinocarbene and carbodicarbenes with N2O. The follow&#8208;up N2/NHC exchange allows easy access to novel carbodicarbenes or cumulenic compounds. The combination of exchange reactions overall allows to &#8220;puzzle&#8221; the fragments at a C(0) atom.

         <title>Crystalline Assemblies of DNA Nanostructures and Their Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in DNA tile and DNA origami&#8208;based 2D and 3D crystal lattice assemblies. It covers innovations in monomer design, guest molecule incorporation, and inorganic coating techniques. Key focus areas include assembly strategies, functional properties, structural challenges, and insights for future applications in programmable materials.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly presents a remarkable approach for creating intricate structures by positioning nanomaterials in precise locations, with control over molecular interactions. For example, material arrays with interplanar distances similar to the wavelength of light can generate structural color through complex interactions like scattering, diffraction, and interference. Moreover, enzymes, plasmonic nanoparticles, and luminescent materials organized in periodic lattices are envisioned to create functional materials with various applications. Focusing on structural DNA nanotechnology, here, we summarized the recent developments of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional lattices made purely from DNA nanostructures. We review DNA&#8208;based monomer design for different lattices, guest molecule assembly, and inorganic material coating techniques and discuss their functional properties and potential applications in photonic crystals, nanoelectronics, and bioengineering as well as future challenges and perspectives.

         <title>Organic Circularly Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: Strategies, Applications and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) is essential in chemistry and materials&#8208;related fields. This Review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP from the molecule to the supramolecular assembly scales, focusing on design strategies such as chirality transfer, assembly&#8208;induced chirality amplification, and chiral superstructure&#8208;mediated transmission. Remaining challenges and an insightful outlook are also presented.







Abstract
Organic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays crucial roles in chemistry and biology for the potential in chiral recognition, asymmetric catalysis, 3D displays, and biological probes. The long&#8208;lived luminescence, large Stokes shift, and unique chiroptical properties make organic circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) a new research hotspot in recent years. Nevertheless, achieving high&#8208;performance organic CPP is still challenging due to the sensitivity and complexity of integrating triplet excitons and polarization within organic materials. This review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP, ranging from design strategies and photophysical properties to underlying luminescence mechanisms and potential applications. Specifically, the design strategies for generating CPP are systemically categorized and discussed according to the interactions between chiral units and chromophores. The applications of organic CPP in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, sensing, chiral recognition, afterglow displays, and information encryption are also illustrated. In addition, we present the current challenges and perspectives on developing organic CPP. We expect this review to provide some instructive design principles to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic CPP materials, offering an in&#8208;depth understanding of the luminescence mechanism and paving the way toward diverse practical applications.

         <dc:description>
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for realizing sustainable society. AEMs as the core component of AEMWEs determine the longevity and efficiency of the system. Ether&#8208;free polyelectrolytes have shown great advantages in chemical stability. This review focuses on the preparation and modification strategies of ether&#8208;free polyelectrolytes and their degradation mechanism in AEMWE systems.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for their potential as sustainable, environmentally friendly, low&#8208;cost sources of renewable energy. Alkaline polyelectrolytes play a crucial role in AEMWEs, determining their performance and longevity. Because heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have been shown to have poor durability in alkaline conditions, this review focuses on ether&#8208;free alkaline polyelectrolytes, which are more chemically stable. The merits, weaknesses, and challenges in preparing ether&#8208;free AEMs are summarized and highlighted. The evaluation of synthesis methods for polymers, modification strategies, and cationic stability will provide insights valuable for the structural design of future alkaline polyelectrolytes. Moreover, the in situ degradation mechanisms of AEMs and ionomers during AEMWE operation are revealed. This review provides insights into the design of alkaline polyelectrolytes for AEMWEs to accelerate their widespread commercialization.

         <title>Single&#8208;Electron Oxidation Triggered by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Enzymes for Asymmetric Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights an emerging strategy in photobiocatalysis: repurposing naturally occurring enzymes by visible&#8208;light excitation to trigger single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation&#8208;driven biotransformations. Combined with protein engineering, the highly oxidizing excited enzymatic flavin cofactor or enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion enables various non&#8208;natural photobiocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bond&#8208;formation reactions in a stereocontrolled and redox&#8208;neutral manner.







Abstract
By integrating enzymatic catalysis with photocatalysis, photoenzymatic catalysis emerges as a powerful strategy to enhance enzyme catalytic capabilities and provide superior stereocontrol in reactions involving reactive intermediates. Repurposing naturally occurring enzymes using visible light is among the most active directions of photoenzymatic catalysis. This Minireview focuses on a cutting&#8208;edge strategy in this direction, namely single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation&#8208;triggered non&#8208;natural biotransformations catalyzed by photoexcited enzymes. These straightforward transformations feature a unique radical mechanism initiated by single&#8208;electron oxidation, achieving redox&#8208;neutral non&#8208;natural C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bond formation, and expanding the chemical toolbox of enzymes. By highlighting recent advances in this field and emphasizing their catalytic mechanisms and synthetic potential, innovative approaches for photobiomanufacturing are anticipated.

         <title>Cleavage of the Robust Silicon&#8211;Fluorine &#963;&#8208;Bond Allows Silicon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation: Synthetic Strategies Toward Ortho&#8208;Silyl Aryl Phosphonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient, and metal&#8208;free Si&#8722;C and P&#8722;C bond formation was achieved by cleaving the robust Si&#8722;F &#963;&#8208;bond. Although activation of the Si&#8722;F bond is highly challenging, Si&#8722;F bond cleavage has been accomplished with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids. Various ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced through this three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides.







Abstract
A straightforward, mild, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides was developed through Si&#8722;F bond activation. Although the Si&#8722;F bond is one of the strongest bonds, Si&#8722;C bond formation via Si&#8722;F bond cleavage with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids has been successfully achieved. This unprecedented strategy provides a facile approach for synthesizing ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates. Notably, this method allows the use of not only dialkylarylsilyl fluorides and diarylalkylsilyl fluorides but also triarylsilyl fluorides as coupling partners, which is uncommon in the field of arylsilane synthesis. Furthermore, a variety of ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced in moderate to good yields with broad functional group tolerance. Additionally, the versatility of ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates was demonstrated by the elaboration of the products into a range of silicon&#8208;containing compounds.

     alt="Cleavage of the Robust Silicon&#8211;Fluorine &#963;-Bond Allows Silicon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation: Synthetic Strategies Toward Ortho-Silyl Aryl Phosphonates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild, efficient, and metal-free Si&#8722;C and P&#8722;C bond formation was achieved by cleaving the robust Si&#8722;F &#963;-bond. Although activation of the Si&#8722;F bond is highly challenging, Si&#8722;F bond cleavage has been accomplished with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids. Various &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-silyl-substituted aryl phosphonates were produced through this three-component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straightforward, mild, and transition-metal-free three-component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides was developed through Si&#8722;F bond activation. Although the Si&#8722;F bond is one of the strongest bonds, Si&#8722;C bond formation via Si&#8722;F bond cleavage with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids has been successfully achieved. This unprecedented strategy provides a facile approach for synthesizing &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-silyl-substituted aryl phosphonates. Notably, this method allows the use of not only dialkylarylsilyl fluorides and diarylalkylsilyl fluorides but also triarylsilyl fluorides as coupling partners, which is uncommon in the field of arylsilane synthesis. Furthermore, a variety of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-silyl-substituted aryl phosphonates were produced in moderate to good yields with broad functional group tolerance. Additionally, the versatility of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-silyl-substituted aryl phosphonates was demonstrated by the elaboration of the products into a range of silicon-containing compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of Multiple Naturally Occurring Meroterpenoid Scaffolds by the Norrish&#8208;Yang Reaction of a p&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acid&#8208;promoted Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction of p&#8208;benzoquinone has been demonstrated. The chemodivergent features of this transformation arises from both the regiodivergence of the hydrogen abstraction and the spin properties of semiquinone radicals. The developed chemistry enabled the stereoselective synthesis of multiple scaffolds of Avarane&#8208;derived meroterpenoid from neoavarone.







Abstract
The Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction, as a typical example, demonstrates the inherent ability of photochemical reaction to facilitate formation of sterically congested C&#8722;C bonds, efficiently crafting intricate ring structure in complex organic molecules. Herein we report for the first time a unified synthesis using quinone&#8208;based acid&#8208;promoted Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization for the stereoselective construction of multiple avarane&#8208;type meroterpenoid natural products.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrophosphorylation of Unactivated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphorylation of alkynes is reported, marking the inaugural example of dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydrophosphorylation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The reaction exhibits a broad scope of unactivated alkynes, consistently yielding structurally diverse P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds with exclusive cis&#8208;selectivity and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;r.r. and 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds are essential across various fields, yet their synthesis via enantioselective P&#8722;C bond formation remains both challenging and underdeveloped. We report the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphorylation of alkynes, facilitated by a newly designed chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. Unlike previous methods that rely on kinetic resolution with less than 50&#8201;% conversion, our approach employs a distinct dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation mechanism, achieving complete conversion of racemic starting materials. This reaction is compatible with a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes, producing products with high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), exclusive cis selectivity, and exceptional regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;r.r. and up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The resulting products were further transformed into a diverse array of enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction details.

         <title>LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd): Designing High Performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Sulfides through &#8220;Band Reformation of AGS&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; (AGS=AgGaS2) strategy leads to the discovery of four infrared nonlinear optical lanthanide sulfides, LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd). Particularly, LiLaGeS4 achieves a balance of wide band gap (3.32&#8197;eV), strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG response (1.06&#215;AGS), and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (&gt;14&#215;AGS), challenging for most lanthanide sulfides.







Abstract
AgGaS2 (AGS) is the most commonly used commercial infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) material. However, AGS has a narrow band gap (Eg=2.58&#8197;eV) and a low laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT), primarily attributed to its mobile liquid&#8208;like Ag+ constituent and the unstable Ag&#8722;S chemical bond. Herein, we propose a &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy, which leads to the successful syntheses of four lanthanide sulfides, LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd), crystalizing in an asymmetric Ama2 structure. LiLaGeS4 demonstrates that eliminating the presence of Ag&#8208;4d band increases the Eg to 3.32&#8197;eV and enhances the LIDT (14&#8211;29&#215;AGS, measured by both powder and single crystal); while increasing the nonbonding density of states of the S&#8208;3p band enhances the 2nd&#8208;nonlinear optical coefficient (1.06&#215;AGS). Besides, the bond length discrepancy between [LiS4], [GeS4] and [LaS8] units leads to a moderate birefringence (&#916;n=0.052). Such a unique structure further results in extremely small thermal expansion with &#945;L=0.41&#8211;1.74&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, along different crystallographic axes. Our theoretical studies indicate that the synergy of the structure building units contribute to the second harmonic generation performance. These results suggest that the &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy provides effective guidance to discover new NLO crystals with optimized performance.

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Dual&#8208;Pore Molecular Crystal for Ethanol/Water and Benzene/Methanol Azeotrope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust &#960;&#8208;stacked dual&#8208;pore molecular crystal TDTBA&#8208;1 has been constructed by a single organic molecule with highly Td symmetry. Due to strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between conjugated aromatic moieties, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits exceptional hydrophobicity, thermostability and chemical resistance, making it an outstanding stationary phase for achieving high&#8208;efficiency separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes.







Abstract
Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two&#8208;dimensional porous structure, namely TDTBA&#8208;1, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;&#8208;stacking of a single organic molecule with highly Td symmetry. Activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high&#8208;resolution gas chromatography.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;-interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two-dimensional porous structure, namely &lt;b&gt;TDTBA-1&lt;/b&gt;, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;-stacking of a single organic molecule with highly &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. Activated &lt;b&gt;TDTBA-1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated &lt;b&gt;TDTBA-1&lt;/b&gt; can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high-resolution gas chromatography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Cyclometalated Platinum Ring Enables Synthetic Post&#8208;processing of a [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platinum&#8208;containing rotaxane was developed and underwent post&#8208;synthetic modification via modulation of the redox properties of the metal center. Oxidation using mild reagents led to rapid conversion to a PtIV complex and a PtIII dimer with different photophysical and shuttling dynamics. Notably, this is the first known example where a Pt&#8722;Pt bond has been used as a bridge to access higher&#8208;order rotaxanes.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) is an attractive avenue to add complexity to already intricate systems. This remains an important, challenging topic that is under&#8208;developed. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of a [2]rotaxane molecule featuring a ring appended to an emissive cyclometalated PtII unit. Modulation of the oxidation state at the metal center can transform the interlocked molecule into a new PtIV [2]rotaxane or a PtIII [3]rotaxane held together by an intermetallic Pt&#8722;Pt bond &#8211; a first of its kind. These molecules display distinct structural and photophysical properties, as well as shuttling dynamics. This approach for post&#8208;synthetic modification could be used to construct more complex MIMs and inorganic supramolecular assemblies with redox properties.

An &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition reaction to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds was developed via &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocations that are generated in situ through the photocatalytic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals by the organic super&#8208;photoreductant CBZ6. The &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals are formed by the &#946;&#8208;addition of alkyl radicals generated in situ by the photocatalytic fragmentation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and esters.







Abstract
We report the photocatalytic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals of amides or esters to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbocations through super photoreductant CBZ6 induced redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis. The &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals are formed by the &#946;&#8208;addition of alkyl radicals generated in situ by the photocatalytic fragmentation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and esters. This method enables the &#945;&#8208;nucleophilic addition of hydroxyl or alkoxyl radicals to amides and esters without any prefunctionalization.

         <title>Photochemically Triggered and Autonomous Oscillatory pH&#8208;Modulated Transient Assembly/Disassembly of DNA Microdroplet Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable or oscillatory pH changes induced by a photoacid or Landolt oscillatory reaction are applied to induce the transient assembly/disassembly of microdroplet protocells. Cyclic and autonomous formation/depletion of the microdroplets following the rhythm of pH changes are demonstrated.







Abstract
The assembly of pH&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;based, phase&#8208;separated microdroplets (MDs) coacervates, consisting of frameworks composed of Y&#8208;shaped nucleic acid modules crosslinked by pH&#8208;responsive strands, is introduced. The phase&#8208;separated MDs reveal dynamic pH&#8208;stimulated switchable or oscillatory transient depletion and reformation. In one system, a photoisomerizable merocyanine/spiropyran photoacid is used for the light&#8208;induced pH switchable modulation of the reaction medium between the values pH=6.0&#8211;4.4. The dynamic transient photochemically&#8208;induced switchable depletion/reformation of phase&#8208;separated MDs, follows the rhythm of pH changes in solution. In a second system, the Landolt oscillatory reaction mixture pH&#8197;7.5&#8594;4.2&#8594;7.5 is applied to stimulate the oscillatory depletion/reformation of the MDs. The autonomous dynamic oscillation of the assembly/disassembly of the MDs follows the oscillating pH rhythm of the reaction medium.

         <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of five catalysts with the same roughness coefficient, Cu2O(d)700, CuO(d)700, CuCl(d)700, Cu(NP1)700 and Cu(NP2)700, was prepared to investigate the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The microcosmic environment of the catalysts was unified by controlling the roughness coefficient, which in turn ensured that the relationship between the crystal facet and the selectivity of C2+ was investigated under the same mass transfer conditions. A positive correlation between the percentage of Cu(100) and the selectivity of C2+ is revealed.







Abstract
Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factor for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8722;C coupling. At &#8722;1.07&#8197;V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3&#8201;%, with a partial current density of &#8722;21.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency&#8208;band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8722;C coupling efficiency.

         <title>A Urease&#8208;Based pH Photoswitch: A General Route to Light&#8208;to&#8208;pH Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general module for light&#8208;to&#8208;pH transduction in enzymatic reaction networks is presented. Using an azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitor for urease, it becomes possible to time&#8208;program a pH transition from 4.7 to 8.3 by light. The autocatalytic positive feedback loop resulting from the pH dependence of urease activity enhances the effective switching factor of the inhibitor. The pH change leads to a change in the activity of other enzymes downstream. These findings show a new and general route to functional light&#8208;responsive ERNs.







Abstract
New approaches for the integration of chemical and physical stimuli to control the dynamics of artificial enzymatic reaction networks (ERNs) are needed. Here, we present a general approach to convert a light stimulus into a time&#8208;programmed pH response. We developed and characterized a panel of photoswitchable inhibitors of urease. Urease activity, now regulated by light via the photoinhibitors, leads to an increase in pH upon hydrolysis of urea into ammonia. Careful choice of characteristics of light, and concentrations of enzyme, substrate, and photoinhibitor, allowed us to control the timing of the pH transition. Furthermore, as all enzymes have an activity&#8211;pH profile, the urease photoinhibitor system can be used to regulate the activities of other enzymes in small reaction networks.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Access to Enantioenriched Chiral Aziridine Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective hydrophosphination of 2H&#8208;azirines is reported based on a newly discovered Mn(I) catalyst that plays an important role in both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the process. Various valuable aziridine phosphines can now be accessed in high yields and enantiopurities. DFT calculations provide mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Herein, we present the first catalytic asymmetric nucleophilic addition of diarylphosphines to 2H&#8208;azirines, facilitated by a chiral Mn(I) complex. This method not only provides access to novel class of derivatives of the aziridine core &#8211; a structural motif recognized for its antitumor and antibacterial properties &#8211; but also introduces a phosphine moiety alongside the generation of an NH moiety within a strained three&#8208;membered ring. The discovery of this new Mn(I) complex that both enables the reaction and induces stereoselectivity is pivotal, as it underscores the significant potential of this earth&#8208;abundant metal in advancing asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Reduction Polymerization of CO2 with Phenylene Silanes Catalyzed by Single Component B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single component B(C6F5)3 can catalyze the step&#8208;growth reduction polymerization of CO2 with phenylene silanes bearing functional groups, and also the tandem Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn polymerization followed by CO2 hydrosilylation polymerization, generating poly(siloxane)s that are impossible to access using the current synthons. The mechanism investigation shows that HB(C6F5)2 derived from B(C6F5)3 plays the crucial role to fix and reduce CO2 to silylformate. The subsequent multiple reductions of silylformate to give polymer and CH4 can be fulfilled by both HB(C6F5)2 and B(C6F5)3.







Abstract
CO2 is an abundant C1 resource but a green&#8208;house gas and chemically inert. Thus, its utilization has been a promising but challenging project. Herein, we report the unprecedented polymerization of CO2 and C6H4(SiMe2H)2 using B(C6F5)3 alone under mild conditions to give poly(silphenylene siloxane) accompanied by releasing CH4. The copolymerization can be extended to comonomers of phenylene silanes bearing functional groups. Moreover, it combines with Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction to establish a tandem polymerization system to achieve super thermal resistant poly(siloxane&#8208;co&#8208;silphenylene siloxane)s. Density functional theory reveals that B(C6F5)3 is activated by silanes to form free HB(C6F5)2, which is the true active species for CO2 reducing to borylformate, the rate controlling step of the polymerization procedure. The subsequent multiple reductions of borylformate to CH4 and the step&#8208;growth to poly(silphenylene siloxane)s can be fulfilled by both B(C6F5)3 and HB(C6F5)2, and the former shows a slightly higher activity. This work opens a new avenue of utilizing CO2 to fabricate polysiloxanes that is unable to access using current manners.

         <title>Expanding the Landscape of Phosphorous&#8208;Based Open Shell Species: Stable Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Trianionic Radicals Based on a Contorted Triphosphaalkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequential single&#8208;electron reduction of a truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene afforded mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triradical anionic species. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly contorted truxene core in the solid&#8208;state structures of mono&#8208; and dianions. The significant structural contortion is further associated with the emergence of open&#8208;shell electronic configurations in the di&#8208; and trianionic species.







Abstract
The stepwise reduction of the highly contorted truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene 1 using KC8 led to the isolation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;anionic species. The solid&#8208;state molecular structures of mono&#8208; and diradical anionic species were elucidated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, revealing elongated P&#8722;C bonds and a pronounced &#8220;indene&#8221; aromatization compared to the parent system. All three radical species displayed distinct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra, providing compelling evidence for the open&#8208;shell electronic configuration of both the diradical and triradical species&#8212;an observation unprecedented in any previously reported phosphorous&#8208;based anionic polyradicals. Mulliken spin density calculations revealed a dominant localization of radical spin on a single phosphorous atom in the monoanion. In the dianion, spin localization is observed on two phosphorous atoms (~34&#8201;% each), with a minor contribution from the third phosphorous (0.13&#8201;%), while the trianion demonstrates a uniform distribution of spin density (~30&#8201;%) across each phosphorous atom.

         <title>Assembly Regulates Gamma Radiation Polymerization of Polytelluoxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetic&#8208;based strategy for regulating responsiveness of gamma radiation&#8208;induced chemical reaction was developed. The strategy was realized in the polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO) through the construction of different assembly microenvironment. The assembly also kept changing with radiation and make it a milder method to prepare such polymer.







Abstract
Regulating chemical drug's responsiveness to gamma radiation is crucial for achieving better therapeutic effects in cancer treatment. Most research focused on thermodynamic chemical structure design, while little attention was paid to kinetic regulate strategy, which possesses greater universality and security. In this study, we achieved a kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy of gamma radiation reaction, through the construction of microphase environment during polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO). We designed hydrophobic segments forming large compound micelles (LCMs) assembly to create kinetically favorable higher concentration for radiation&#8208;induced reaction. It exhibited a &gt; ten times higher responsiveness and, as far as we know, merely required a minimum dosage of 5 Gy for polymerization to occur. What's more, by taking advantages of the assembly change with Te&#8722;O hydrophilic segments and gamma radiation, polymerization became milder with lower polydispersity than previous methods. Such kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy could offer a novel perspective on the design of radiation&#8208;responsive chemoradiotherapy and other radiation&#8208;induced chemical process.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating chemical drug's responsiveness to gamma radiation is crucial for achieving better therapeutic effects in cancer treatment. Most research focused on thermodynamic chemical structure design, while little attention was paid to kinetic regulate strategy, which possesses greater universality and security. In this study, we achieved a kinetic-based regulate strategy of gamma radiation reaction, through the construction of microphase environment during polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO). We designed hydrophobic segments forming large compound micelles (LCMs) assembly to create kinetically favorable higher concentration for radiation-induced reaction. It exhibited a &amp;gt; ten times higher responsiveness and, as far as we know, merely required a minimum dosage of 5 Gy for polymerization to occur. What's more, by taking advantages of the assembly change with Te&#8722;O hydrophilic segments and gamma radiation, polymerization became milder with lower polydispersity than previous methods. Such kinetic-based regulate strategy could offer a novel perspective on the design of radiation-responsive chemoradiotherapy and other radiation-induced chemical process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Liposome&#8208;Based Extracellular Artificial Organelles on Individual Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Individual cells are coated with multilayered functional liposomes, serving as extracellular artificial organelles, or exorganelles, and conferring extrinsic capacity on the cells. The method is highly cytocompatible, interfacing with living cells, and chemically flexible in the lipid composition and cargo of the exorganelles. Cells are empowered with various functions, beyond their innate ones, such as multienzymatic catalysis, magnetizability, stimuli&#8208;responsive chemical release, and cell modification.







Abstract
Integration of living cells with extrinsic functional entities gives rise to bioaugmented nanobiohybrids, which hold tremendous potential across diverse fields such as cell therapy, biocatalysis, and cell robotics. This study presents a biocompatible method for incorporating multilayered functional liposomes onto the cell surface, creating extracellular artificial organelles or exorganelles. The introduction of various extrinsic functionalities to cells is achieved without comprising their viabilities. The integration of extrinsic enzymatic reactions is exemplified through the cascade reaction involving glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, our protocol offers the design flexibility to customize liposome compositions, thereby providing effective cell modification. The versatility of the liposome&#8208;based exorganelle approach establishes an advanced chemical tool, empowering cells with novel functionalities that surpass or are complementary to their innate capabilities.

         <title>Catalytic Dearomative [1,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Carbon Shift of Heterole&#8208;Fused Norcaradienes Enabled Concise Helicenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile helicenation of two (hetero) arenes linked by an alkynylcyclopropane: Weakly aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes from hydroarylation of heterole&#8208;substituted alkynylcyclopropanes reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative and controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening aromatization of the dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene gives the acylmethyl&#8208;shifted aromatization products, which are readily helicenated with the neighboring (hetero) arenes.







Abstract
In contrast to the locked fluxionality of norcaradienes fused by benzene, unexplored less aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes, creatively generated by intramolecular hydroarylation of heteroaryl alkynylcyclopropanes, reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift of norcaradienes akin to the reduced aromaticity of heterole. This &#8220;walk&#8221; shift was confirmed by the isolation of a cycloheptatriene species derived from ring&#8208;expansion of a dearomatized alkynylated heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening rearomatization of these dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes gives the products featuring migratory acylmethyls that are competent for helicenation with the neighboring (hetero) arenes via (formal) dehydrative alkenylation. Such balancing reactivity of heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes will open up the opportunity for the development of controllable reactions of fused norcaradienes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Diborylation and Silaboration of Azoarenes: A Simple Photoinduced Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have shown that, in the absence of a catalyst or a base, azoarenes&#8242; photoswitchability can be exploited to aid in their diborylation into 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)hydrazines. The transformation is achieved using commercially available diboron reagent, bis(catecholato)diboron and extremely mild conditions are used in the devised approach. Moreover, silaboranes were also activated using this process to yield 1&#8208;silyl&#8208;2&#8208;borylhydrazines.







Abstract
The diborylation of the N=N double bond of azoarenes has been achieved using a commercially available diboron reagent, B2cat2 [bis(catecholato)diboron]. By utilizing the photo&#8208;switchable nature of azoarenes under blue&#8208;LED light irradiation, an uncatalyzed diborylation and silaboration yielded a broad range of functionalized hydrazine derivatives. The mechanistic origin validates the importance of cis configuration, which is corroborated by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2+2] Annulation for the Construction of Chiral Benzocyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective [2+2] annulation for the construction of chiral benzocyclobutenes was developed for the first time. A wide range of enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs could be prepared selectively under mild conditions. Further transformations of the products provide efficient access to a diverse array of chiral BCBs. The enantiodetermining step has been investigated via isolation of the chiral palladacycle intermediate and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Asymmetric de novo synthesis of benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) via catalytic intermolecular reaction is highly desired for efficient access to this important class of compounds, yet such a strategy remains unmet challenge. Here, we report a Pd/Pyrox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation between arylboronic acids and functionalized alkenes, providing an unprecedented efficient protocol to access various enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs in a modular and versatile manner under mild conditions. A broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity has been achieved under the current protocol. The isolation and characterization of the key chiral palladacycle intermediate, together with DFT calculations, provides strong evidence for the catalytic pathway including an enantiodetermining arylpalladation step.

         <title>Hollow Hydrogels for Excellent Aerial Water Collection and Autonomous Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conical hollow hydrogel architecture is reported, which can rapidly collect water from humid air to a saturation point, whereupon it automatically and continually releases fresh water without any external assistance, demonstrating high potential for emergency water collection in arid areas. The hydrogel is biodegradable, and can eventually decompose, and become an organic fertilizer after the water supply is not required.







Abstract
Air moisture is a valuable and omnipresent resource of fresh water. However, traditional water collectors come with an enduring problem of the water&#8208;release step, which requires special devices and additional energy to remove the water from the adsorbent, such as heat, sunlight, or both. Herein, we report the first composite conical hollow hydrogel architecture fabricated through a film&#8208;to&#8208;tube transforming protocol, designed to harvest water from aerial humidity. This hollow hydrogel device can rapidly collect water from humid air to a saturation point, whereupon it automatically and continually releases fresh water at room temperature. The entire water collection and release process does not require any external assistance. Therefore, this device is highly suitable for emergency water collection in arid areas. As an exemplary demonstration, positioning the hollow hydrogel device next to a plant turns into an individualized system for irrigation. Since the device is biodegradable, it eventually decomposes and becomes an organic fertilizer after the water supply is not required. For long&#8208;term application, the water&#8208;release process can be monitored in real time by an electronic device to indicate the amount of collected water. The hollow hydrogel combines the humidity&#8208;adsorbing capacity with autonomous water release that carries the potential for harvesting water from humidity to address the shortage of fresh water, especially in arid locations where other sources of water are scarce or inaccessible.

This hollow hydrogel device can rapidly collect water from humid air to a saturation point, whereupon it automatically and continually releases fresh water at room temperature. The entire water collection and release process does not require any external assistance. Therefore, this device is highly suitable for emergency water collection in arid areas. As an exemplary demonstration, positioning the hollow hydrogel device next to a plant turns into an individualized system for irrigation. Since the device is biodegradable, it eventually decomposes and becomes an organic fertilizer after the water supply is not required. For long-term application, the water-release process can be monitored in real time by an electronic device to indicate the amount of collected water. The hollow hydrogel combines the humidity-adsorbing capacity with autonomous water release that carries the potential for harvesting water from humidity to address the shortage of fresh water, especially in arid locations where other sources of water are scarce or inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects Have a Significant Impact on UV/Vis Absorption Spectra of Chromophores in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures of the isolated indole molecule as well as indole dissolved in water were sampled with and without consideration of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). For each sampled structure, electronic excitation energies were calculated using a wavefunction&#8208;based method called ADC(2) for generating UV/Vis absorption spectra. Shapes and solvatochromism observed in the measured spectra were reproduced only when NQEs were considered in the sampling.







Abstract
Despite the broadly acknowledged importance of solvation effects on measured UV/Vis spectra in the context of solvatochromism or chemical reactions in solution, it is still an open challenge to calculate UV/Vis spectra with predictive accuracy. This is particularly true when it comes to the impact of nuclear quantum effects on these experimental observables. In the present work, we calculate the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of indole in aqueous solution with a combination of a correlated wavefunction method for computing electronic excitation energies and enhanced path integral simulations for rigorous sampling of nuclear configurations including the quantum effects in solution. After validating our approach based on gas&#8208;phase benchmarking, we demonstrate that the lineshape of the spectrum measured in aqueous solution is quantitatively recovered, without the application of any shifting, scaling, or broadening, only after including nuclear quantum effects in addition to thermal fluctuations and solvation at ambient conditions. Our findings demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are &#8220;visible&#8221; in UV/Vis spectra of chromophores measured in solution even at room temperature and, therefore, that they must be considered computationally to achieve predictive accuracy.

         <title>Enabling Visible Light Sensitization of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in Dimeric LnIII/GaIII Metallacrowns through Functionalization with RuII Complexes for NIR&#8208;II Multiplex Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LnRu&#8208;3 dimeric LnIII/GaIII metallacrows bearing four RuII chromophoric complexes have been synthesized and proved to exhibit characteristic emissions of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in the NIR&#8208;II region upon excitation with visible light through metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states. The unambiguous detection of different LnIII transitions has been demonstrated by NIR&#8208;II luminescence imaging of capillaries containing solutions of LnRu&#8208;3.







Abstract
Multiplex imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) provides exciting opportunities for more precise understanding of biological processes and more accurate diagnosis of diseases by enabling real&#8208;time acquisition of images with improved contrast and spatial resolution in deeper tissues. Today, the number of imaging agents suitable for this modality remains very scarce. In this work, we have synthesized and fully characterized, including theoretical calculations, a series of dimeric LnIII/GaIII metallacrowns bearing RuII polypyridyl complexes, LnRu&#8208;3 (Ln=YIII, YbIII, NdIII, ErIII). Relaxed structures of YRu&#8208;3 in the ground and the excited electronic states have been calculated using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory methods. Detailed photophysical studies of LnRu&#8208;3 have demonstrated that characteristic emission signals of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in the NIR&#8208;II range can be sensitized upon excitation in the visible range through RuII&#8208;centered metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states. We have also showed that these NIR&#8208;II signals are unambiguously detected in an imaging experiment using capillaries and biological tissue&#8208;mimicking phantoms. This work opens unprecedented perspectives for NIR&#8208;II multiplex imaging using LnIII&#8208;based molecular compounds.

         <title>Cleavage of Carbodicarbenes with N2O for Accessing Stable Diazoalkenes: Two&#8208;Fold Ligand Exchange at a C(0)&#8208;Atom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbodicarbenes activate N2O in a NHC/N2 ligand exchange reaction to give stable diazoalkenes and a urea byproduct. By applying the NHC/N2 exchange, new classes of benzimidazole&#8208; and benzothiazole&#8208;diazoalkenes are reported. Combining two&#8208;fold ligand exchange reactions at C(0) a versatile route to carbodicarbenes and cumulenes is opened up.







Abstract
The cleavage of carbophosphinocarbenes and carbodicarbenes with nitrous oxide (N2O) leads to the formation of room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes. The utility of Ph3P/N2 and NHC/N2 ligand exchange reactions were demonstrated by accessing novel benzimidazole&#8208; and benzothiazole derived diazoalkenes, which are not accessible by the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. The stable diazoalkenes subsequently allow further ligand exchange reactions at C(0) with carbon monoxide, isocyanide, or a diamidocarbene (DAC). Overall, the combination of hitherto unknown NHC/N2 and N2/L (L = DAC, CO, R&#8722;NC) ligand exchange reactions at a C(0) center allow the selective functionalization of the carbodicarbene ligand structure which represents a new methodology to rapidly assemble novel carbodicarbenes or cumulenic compounds.

         <title>Dynamic Organic Phosphorescence Glass by Rigid&#8208;Soft Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;soft coupling strategy is adopted to prepare organic phosphorescence glass with excellent shaping ability. The glasses exhibit stable RTP and fascinating HTP emission in harsh conditions, and the phosphorescence behavior can be dynamically manipulated by photoactivation. Direct patterning is further achieved using photolithography to offer various afterglow patterns, which can be easily erased and rewritten with good reversibility.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescence glass has garnered considerable attention owing to the excellent shaping ability and photophysical behavior, but facile construction from single&#8208;component phosphors is still challenging. Herein, a rigid&#8208;soft coupling design is adopted in organic phosphors of ICO, CCO and PCO, thus preparing phosphorescence glasses through melting&#8208;quenching method to give excellent shaping ability and dynamic phosphorescence. RTP performance is significantly enhanced in the dense&#8208;structure glass, and intriguing high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) is still observable even at 400&#8197;K. Direct patterning under UV irradiation is also achieved using photolithography technique, allowing for the creation of high&#8208;quality afterglow patterns that can be reversibly erased and rewritten. This rigid&#8208;soft conformation in organic phosphors elucidates a promising concept for achieving efficient RTP glass with wide application prospects.

         <title>&#8220;Boron Ylide&#8221; Enables Stereoselective Construction of gem&#8208;Diborylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The umpolung of diborodibromomethane (DBDBM) offers a convenient approach to generate &#945;&#8208;bromo &#8220;boron ylide&#8221;. The &#8220;boron ylide&#8221; serves as C1 synthon for cyclopropanation reaction, facilitating the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. Asymmetric cyclopropanation was achieved with the aid of chiral auxiliary. Control experiments exhibit that the boryl groups are essential for the smooth progress of the reaction and the control of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The stereoselective cyclopropanation of olefins with &#8220;boron ylide&#8221; is disclosed for the first time, providing a modular strategy for the synthesis of stereospecific diboryl&#8208;functionalized cyclopropanes. The chiral gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes are synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity with the aid of a chiral auxiliary. Based on the powerful transformable ability of boryl group, those challenging multi&#8208;quaternary carbon centers in cyclopropane units have been facilely constructed with excellent stereoselectivity. Control experiments indicate that the boryl groups are necessary for both chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity control.

         <title>Clar's Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Sextet Rule for the Construction of Red Multiple Resonance Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we have successfully constructed the first red &#960;&#8208;extended multiple resonance (MR) emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene. The corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608&#8197;nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode exhibits a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3&#8201;%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7&#8201;% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000 cd/m2.







Abstract
Despite the proliferation of multiple resonance (MR) materials in the blue to green spectral ranges, red MR emitters remain scarce in the literature, an area that certainly warrants attention for future applications. Here, through a clever application of classic Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we triumphantly constructed the first red MR emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene (fewer &#960;&#8208;sextets). Theoretical studies indicate that the quantity of &#960;&#8208;sextets ultimately determines the optical band gap of a molecule, rather than the number of fused benzene rings. Benefiting from the high photoluminescence quantum yield of ~94&#8201;% and horizontal dipole ratio of ~90&#8201;%, the corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608&#8197;nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3&#8201;%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7&#8201;% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000&#8197;cd/m2.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Construction of N&#8208;Linked Glycopeptides through Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type glycopeptides have been successfully synthesized for the first time via photocatalytic free radical reactions. This novel approach involves the addition of acyl radicals to unprotected peptides and is expected to have broad applications in modifying a range of important natural products and peptides.







Abstract
The glycosylation of peptides and proteins can significantly impact their intrinsic properties, such as conformation, stability, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Current methods for preparing N&#8208;linked glycopeptides typically rely on amide bond formation, which can be limited by the presence of reactive functional groups like acids and amines. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides offers a promising approach to obtaining N&#8208;linked glycopeptides. In this study, we demonstrate the preparation of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective Giese addition between N&#8208;glycosyl oxamic acid and peptides containing dehydroalanine (Dha) under visible light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the coupling of aspartic acid and glycosylamine, this approach utilizes the conjugation of N&#8208;glycosylated carbamoyl radicals with Dha, facilitating the straightforward modification of complex peptides.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stage Optimization of Pore Size and Shape in Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Selective and Sensitive Benzene Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned materials based on cobalt&#8208;vanadium trimers have been synthesized in which benzene/cyclohexane selectivity is tuned from 4.5 to 15.6 to 195.4 and to 482.5 by pushing the boundary of the pacs platform towards the smallest modules achievable so far.







Abstract
Compared to exploratory development of new structure types, pushing the limits of isoreticular synthesis on a high&#8208;performance MOF platform may have higher probability of achieving targeted properties. Multi&#8208;modular MOF platforms could offer even more opportunities by expanding the scope of isoreticular chemistry. However, navigating isoreticular chemistry towards best properties on a multi&#8208;modular platform is challenging due to multiple interconnected pathways. Here on the multi&#8208;modular pacs (partitioned acs) platform, we demonstrate accessibility to a new regime of pore geometry using two independently adjustable modules (framework&#8208;forming module 1 and pore&#8208;partitioning module 2). A series of new pacs materials have been made. Benzene/cyclohexane selectivity is tuned, progressively, from 4.5 to 15.6 to 195.4 and to 482.5 by pushing the boundary of the pacs platform towards the smallest modules known so far. The exceptional stability of these materials in retaining both porosity and single crystallinity enables single&#8208;crystal diffraction studies of different crystal forms (as&#8208;synthesized, activated, guest&#8208;loaded) that help reveal the mechanistic aspects of adsorption in pacs materials.

         <title>Novel Amorphous Nitride&#8208;Halide Solid Electrolytes with Enhanced Performance for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 3, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a new class of amorphous nitride&#8208;halide solid electrolytes, Li3xMClyNx (referred to as LMCN, M=Ta or La, 1&#8804;3x&#8804;1.4, y=5 or 3), which can be rendered amorphous through nitrogen incorporation. The introduction of N3&#8722; into LMCN alters the coordination between cations and anions, leading to the formation of amorphous structure and enhancing Li+ transport by stretching of M&#8722;Cl bonds. Li3xTaCl5Nx (referred to as LTCN) achieves ionic conductivities as high as 7.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 3x=1.25 and 30&#8201;&#176;C. These properties enable the corresponding all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries to perform well at high rates and charging cut&#8208;off voltage, and to maintain stable cycling at temperatures as low as &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. LMCN shows great promise as a novel solid electrolyte, expected to guide future research and serve as a representative model for the development of other nitrogen&#8208;halide solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Solid electrolytes (SEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are garnering considerable attention for their potential applications in next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Amorphous SEs with dual&#8208;anion hold great promise for achieving favorable performance, such as high ionic conductivity and good compatibility with electrodes within ASSBs. Here, we discover a family of amorphous nitride&#8208;halide SEs, Li3xMClyNx (M=Ta or La, 1&#8804;3x&#8804;1.4, y=5 or 3), which can achieve ionic conductivities up to 7.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The amorphous properties and local structures are investigated using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and atomic pair distribution function analysis. Impressively, ASSBs employing amorphous Li3xTaCl5Nx have demonstrated good performance at high rates and charging voltages, as well as at low temperature.

These properties enable the corresponding all-solid-state batteries to perform well at high rates and charging cut-off voltage, and to maintain stable cycling at temperatures as low as &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. LMCN shows great promise as a novel solid electrolyte, expected to guide future research and serve as a representative model for the development of other nitrogen-halide solid electrolytes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid electrolytes (SEs) in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are garnering considerable attention for their potential applications in next-generation energy storage systems. Amorphous SEs with dual-anion hold great promise for achieving favorable performance, such as high ionic conductivity and good compatibility with electrodes within ASSBs. Here, we discover a family of amorphous nitride-halide SEs, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;MCl&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Ta or La, 1&#8804;3&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;1.4, y=5 or 3), which can achieve ionic conductivities up to 7.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The amorphous properties and local structures are investigated using powder X-ray diffraction, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and atomic pair distribution function analysis. Impressively, ASSBs employing amorphous Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;TaCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; have demonstrated good performance at high rates and charging voltages, as well as at low temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
