         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Multi&#8208;Cationic Molecular Chains for Gate Mechanism Controlled Superionic Conduction in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are high potential in achieving better safety and higher energy density, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) cannot fully satisfy the complicated requirements of SSBs. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (COF&#8208;MCMC) was developed as an efficient SSE. The MCMCs chemically anchored on COF channels were generated by nano&#8208;confined copolymerization of cationic ionic liquid monomers, which can function as Li+ selective gates. The coulombic interaction between MCMCs and anions leads to easier dissociation of Li+ from coordinated states, and thus Li+ transport is accelerated. While the movement of anions is restrained due to the charge interaction, resulting in a high Li+ conductivity of 4.9&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1and Li+ transference number of 0.71 at 30 &#176;C. The SSBs with COF&#8208;MCMC demonstrate an excellent specific energy density of 403.4 Wh kg&#8209;1 with high cathode loading and limited Li metal source.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Perylene diimide&#8208;tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non&#8208;polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA&#8208;OEt) with the aggregates induce a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors gabs of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8208;2. The hierarchical chiral induction exhibited an intriguing threshold dose effect, i.e., the chiral induction does not occur at the low concentration range of cAA&#8208;OEt but is triggered when cAA&#8208;OEt exceeds a threshold concentration. The inhibited interconversion between the Rp and Sp conformers of pillar[5]arene, which is further restricted in the aggregation, plays a crucial role in the threshold effect. When adding an enantiopure cAA&#8208;OEt first to the threshold concentration and then adding an equal amount of the antipodal cAA&#8208;OEt to give cAA&#8208;OEt in racemic form, CD spectra having the same sign as the CD induced by pure first cAA&#8208;OEt were induced, showing an unprecedented "first come, first served" effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Radical Afterglow of Carboxylic Acids with Tunable Spin Populations and Hole&#8208;Electron Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>No matter photoinduced organic radicals have been reported frequently, they are usually non&#8208;luminescent at ambient conditions. The internal mechanism on stability and electronic transitions of photoinduced radicals, is thus crucial for the development of relevant materials. Herein, a series of photoinduced radical emission systems were developed conveniently through doping benzoic acids into the hydrogen donor polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. Visual photoinduced radical emission and photochromism could be observed on Ph&#8208;3COOH@PVA film with the formation of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type structure. For the first time, radical afterglow appeared with energy transfer from triplet state. The appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for decreasing spin population and promoting electronic transitions of the radical. This study largely expands the radical emission property from both internal mechanism and practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphosphoryl&#8208;functionalized Polyoxometalates: Structurally and Electronically Tunable Hybrid Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson polyoxometalate (POM) containing a diphosphoryl group (P2O6X) of the general formula [P2W17O57(P2O6X)]6&#8208;&#160; (X = O, NH, or CR1R2). Modifying the bridging unit X was found to impact the redox potentials of the POM. The ease with which a range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized diphosphonic acids (X = CR1R2) can be prepared provides possibilities to access diverse functionalized hybrid POMs. Compared to existing phosphonate hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson POMs, diphosphoryl&#8208;substituted POMs offer a wider tunable redox window and enhanced hydrolytic stability. This study provides a basis for the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation hybrid Wells&#8208;Dawson POMs.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck, for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Embedded in Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a two&#8208;step approach to obtain synthetically versatile bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives using Grignard reagents. This method allows the incorporation of BCP units in tetrapyrrolic macrocycles and the synthesis of a new class of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two BCP units. In addition, a doubly N&#8208;confused system was also formed in the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the BCP bridgeheads. The pyrrole rings in BCP containing macrocycles exist in 1,3&#8208;alternate or abab conformation, as observed from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and 2D NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

Using the iniferter N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) under visible&#8208;light irradiation with and without additional photocatalyst is demonstrated for the first time. Through the transfer of the polymerization to a commercially available microscope, automated laser writing of different polymers in mesoporous silica films is realized.







Abstract
For miniaturization, as well as for improving artificial nanopore performance, precise local polymer functionalization and the combination of different functionalities are required. Imagining data driven nanopore design automated nanopore functionalization would be beneficial. Using direct laser writing as one option of automated nanopore polymer functionalization visible light induced polymerizations are beneficial. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of mesoporous silicafilms with two different polymers using automated laser writing. For this we developed a visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm and 405&#8197;nm) N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) inifierter initiated polymerization. While transferring this visible light induced polymerization using SBDC to a commercially available microscope, direct, automated laser writing, as well as polymer re&#8208;initiation was demonstrated. Thereby, polymer spots of 37 and 40&#8197;&#956;m in diameter were achieved using 1&#8211;5&#8197;seconds for each irradiated spot.

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching among different anchoring sites of single&#8208;molecule junctions was achieved by mechanical tuning, leading to the control of the transmission pathway between the destructive quantum interference (DQI) and the constructive quantum interference (CQI) at the single&#8208;molecule level, which provides a new strategy for designing molecular electromechanics devices.







Abstract
The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6&#8197;nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppressive strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) enable hot electrons excited on Ru to transfer to a TiO2&#8722;H2 support, thereby reducing the electron density on Ru to accelerate light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with methane. The optimized Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 composite exhibits an enhanced CO2 conversion rate of 400&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis field, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electron transfer is rarely explored. Herein, we describe how SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, on suppression of SMSI Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate compared to Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2, a considerable number of photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously rendering Ru&#948;+ electron deficient and better able to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes the limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts by regulating two&#8208;phase interactions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Molecular Oxygen Activation in Heterogeneous Thermo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Mini&#8208;review systematically summarized the recent research progress of dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) for molecular oxygen activation (MOA) in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Despite the rapid developments in this field, many great challenges still hinder the practical application of DASCs. We look forward to the challenges and application prospects of DASCs for MOA.







Abstract
Efficient molecular oxygen activation (MOA) is the key to environmentally friendly catalytic oxidation reactions. In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100&#8201;% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular oxygen (O2) due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Bound Diarylethene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films as Photoactuators with a Directed Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators is presented. The DAE units are assembled in a surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. The light&#8208;induced length changes of the DAE linkers multiply to anisotropic mesoscopic length changes. Due to the architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, here, bending a cantilever and performing work.







Abstract
Molecular machines and responsive materials open a plethora of new opportunities in nanotechnology. We present an oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators, arranged in a way to yield an anisotropic response. The DAE units are assembled, together with a secondary linker, into a monolithic surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. By Infrared (IR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy as well as by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, we show that the light&#8208;induced extension changes of the molecular DAE linkers multiply to yield mesoscopic and anisotropic length changes. Due to the special architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, leading to the bending of a cantilever and performing work. This research shows the potential of assembling light&#8208;powered molecules into SURMOFs to yield photoactuators with a directed response, presenting a path to advanced actuators.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of a Pyryne Precursor to Higher Pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By palladium&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization reactions of pyrene&#8208;based o&#8208;trimethylsilyl triflates larger cyclic pyrenylenes were formed with up to 10&#8208;membered rings as has been unambiguously characterized by SCXRD. Furthermore, the underlying reaction mechanism has been studied by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The palladium catalyzed cyclotrimerization of ortho&#8208;silylaryl triflates as aryne precursors is meanwhile an established method to synthesize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with triphenylene cores. During the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a pyrene with an o&#8208;silylaryl triflate moiety in the K&#8208;region higher homologues with central eight&#8208; and ten&#8208;membered rings (the pyrenylenes) were found, besides the expected trimer and a protocol was developed to isolate all members of this series. This unprecedented new class of PAHs was fully investigated by all means, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of single&#8208;crystals, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, a mechanism of all higher cyclooligomers is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;By palladium-catalyzed oligomerization reactions of pyrene-based &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-trimethylsilyl triflates larger cyclic pyrenylenes were formed with up to 10-membered rings as has been unambiguously characterized by SCXRD. Furthermore, the underlying reaction mechanism has been studied by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled deformation of soft nanogel particles during their occlusion within calcite crystals enables the generation of artificial biominerals with oriented internal structure. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and indicates that the rational design of multi&#8208;scale nanocomposite materials should be feasible via nanoparticle occlusion.







Abstract
Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. This deformation occurs normal to the growth direction of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on Nitrogen Electrooxidation to Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The powerful electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques are employed to detect reaction intermediates. Based on the detected intermediates, the associative mechanism with the addition of hydroxyl at distal N (distal mechanism) is deduced for nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR).







Abstract
As a potential substitute technique for conventional nitrate production, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is gaining more and more attention. But, the pathway of this reaction is still unknown owing to the lack of understanding on key reaction intermediates. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotope&#8208;labeled online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to study the NOR mechanism over a Rh catalyst. Based on the detected asymmetric NO2&#8722; bending, NO3&#8722; vibration, N=O stretching, and N&#8722;N stretching as well as isotope&#8208;labeled mass signals of N2O and NO, it can be deduced that the NOR undergoes an associative mechanism (distal approach) and the strong N&#8801;N bond in N2 prefers to break concurrently with the hydroxyl addition in distal N.

         <title>Solid Interhalogen Compounds with Effective Br0 Fixing for Stable High&#8208;energy Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound IBr as a cathode, in which the active I fixes the oxidized Br0 without generating crossing&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charge and discharge process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers improved energy density compared with those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes.







Abstract
Though massive efforts have been devoted to exploring Br&#8208;based batteries, the highly soluble Br2/Br3&#8722; species causing rigorous &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, leads to severe self&#8208;discharge and low Coulombic efficiency. Conventionally, quaternary ammonium salts such as methyl ethyl morpholinium bromide (MEMBr) and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) are used to fix Br2 and Br3&#8722;, but they occupy the mass and volume of battery without capacity contribution. Here, we report an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound, IBr, as a cathode to address the above challenges, in which the oxidized Br0 is fixed by iodine (I), thoroughly eliminating cross&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charging and discharging process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers remarkably high energy density of 385.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is higher than those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes. Our work provides new approaches to achieve active solid interhalogen chemistry for high&#8208;energy electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Catalytic Homologation&#8208;Allylboration Sequence for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Fluorohydrins with Tertiary Fluoride Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrins with tertiary fluoride stereocenters can be obtained via catalytic homologation and allylboration sequence with stereoselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. By allylboration of ketones, the process can also be used to access compounds with adjacent tertiary C&#8722;F and C&#8722;O stereocenters.







Abstract
Homologation of trisubstituted fluoroalkenes followed by allylboration of aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates is suitable for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrin and amine products. In the presence of (R)&#8208;iodo&#8208;BINOL catalyst enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% can be achieved by formation of a single stereoisomer with adjacent stereocenters, of which one is a tertiary C&#8722;F center.

         <title>Photoelectromagnetic Responsive Adaptive Porous Frameworks through Dynamic Covalent Chemistry of Tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned Aryldicyanomethyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic materials undergoing adaptive solid&#8208;state transitions are attractive for soft mechanics and information technology. Here, we report a novel porous framework system based on macrocyclic trimers assembled from open&#8208;shell tetraarylethylene building blocks with aryldicyanomethyl radicals as coupling linkers. Under mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, the framework showed adaptability by activating conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;based transformations, thus displaying macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, luminescence, and magnetism. We studied the dynamic processes by variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR), variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (VT&#8208;ESR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement and further established a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for multi&#8208;modal information encryption.

         <title>Do The Twist: Efficient Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Visible Light Polymerization Facilitated by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Inter&#8208;system Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light to drive polymerizations with spatiotemporal control offers a mild alternative to contemporary UV&#8208;light&#8208;based production of soft materials. In this spectral region, photoredox catalysis represents the most efficient polymerization method, yet it relies on the use of heavy&#8208;atoms, such as precious metals or toxic halogens. Herein, spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy&#8208;atoms. A ~5&#8208;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Au13 Clusters Stabilized by Enantiopure Monodentate NHC Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Au nanoclusters have promising application prospects in chiral sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptics. However, enantiopure superatomic homogold clusters with crystallographic structures emitting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain challenging. In this study, we designed chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), and for the first time enantioselectively synthesized a pair of monovalent cationic superatomic Au13 clusters. This new enantiomeric pair of clusters has a quasi&#8208;C2 symmetric core and exhibited CPL with an unprecedent solution&#8208;state quantum yield (QY) of 61% among those of the atomically precise Au nanoclusters. DFT calculations provided insights into the circular dichroism behavior, and revealed the origin of CPL from superatomic Au clusters. This work opens a new avenue for developing novel homochiral nanoclusters using chiral NHC ligands and provides fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptics of metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;planar Nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] Cluster Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts, as promising alternative to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are still highly expected to achieve better performance by modulating the composition and spatial structure of active site. Herein, we constructed the non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane. Adjacent double Fe atoms effectively weaken the O&#8208;O bond by forming a peroxide bridge&#8208;like adsorption configuration, and the introduction of S atoms breaks the planar coordination of Fe resulting in greater structural deformation tension, lower spin state, and downward shifted Fe d&#8208;band center, which together facilitate the release of OH* intermediate. Hence, the non&#8208;planar [Fe2S2] cluster catalyst, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V, displays superior ORR activity than that of planar [FeN4] or [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into the co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Induced Electronic States Regulation Boosting Electroreduction of Dilute Nitrate to Ammonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically converting NO3&#8208; into NH3 offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO3&#8208; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8208; reduction reaction (NO3RR) with dilute NO3&#8208; concentration (&#8804;100 ppm NO3&#8208;&#8208;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH3 yield vs. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu+ content leads to an enhanced NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion activity. Under a low NO3&#8208;&#8208;N concentration of 100 ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100% NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion at &#8208;0.55 to &#8208;0.6 V vs. RHE, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield of 309 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1, which is more than 25 times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO3&#8208; to NH3, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Fusion of Thermoresponsive Polypeptides with UCST&#8208;type Behavior Mediates 1D Assembly of Coiled&#8208;Coil Bundlemers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths were genetically fused to two different computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides with distinct thermal stability, to develop new strategies to assemble coiled coil peptides via temperature&#8208;triggered phase separation of the RLP units. Their successful production in bacterial expression hosts was verified via gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) turbidimetry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements confirmed the stability of the coiled coils and showed that the thermosensitive phase behavior of the RLPs was preserved in the genetically fused hybrid polypeptides. Cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and coarse&#8208;grained modeling revealed that functionalizing the coiled coils with thermoresponsive RLPs leads to their thermally triggered noncovalent assembly into nanofibrillar assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Redistribution Enables Redox&#8208;Resistible Li6PS5Cl towards High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivity hold great promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the parasitic redox reactions between sulfide electrolyte and Li metal result in interfacial instability and rapid decline of the battery performance. Herein, a redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) electrolyte is created by regulating the electron distribution in LPSC with Mg and F incorporation. The introduction of Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptation from Li, and F generates the self&#8208;limiting interface, which hinders the redox reactions between LPSC and Li metal. This redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2 electrolyte therefore presents a high critical current density (2.3 times of pristine electrolyte). The LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2/Li cell shows an outstanding cycling stability (93.3%@100 cycles at 0.2 C). This study highlights the electronic structure modulation to address redox issues on sulfide&#8208;based lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensional Reduction of Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cryopreservation of Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)&#8208;based 2D MOLs with different thickness (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and density of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized. Both ice recrystallization inhibition activity (IRI) and RBCs cryopreservation assay confirm the pronounced better IRI activity and excellent cell recovery efficiency (up to ~63% at a very low concentration of 0.7 mg mL&#8211;1) of thin&#8208;layered Hf&#8208;MOLs compared to their 3D counterparts, thereby verifying the dimensional reduction strategy to improved cryoprotectant behaviors.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra-thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of interfacial hydrogen-bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)-based 2D MOLs with different thickness (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and density of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Cationic Defects Coupling with Local Alkaline&#8208;Enriched Environment for Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inferior activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously limit their practical applications in various electrochemical energy conversion systems. Here we report, a drastic nonequilibrium precipitation approach to construct a highly disordered crystal structure of layered double hydroxides as a model OER catalyst. The unconventional crystal structure contains high&#8208;density cationic defects coupled with a local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment, enabling ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8208; ions and thus avoiding the formation of a local acidic environment and dissolution of active sites during OER. An integrated experimental and theoretical study reveals that high&#8208;density cationic defects, especially di&#8208;cationic and multi&#8208;cationic defects, serve as highly active and durable catalytic sites. This work showcases a promising strategy of crystal structure engineering to construct robust active sites for high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution in an alkaline solution.</dc:description>

         <title>A Recyclable and Scalable High&#8208;Capacity Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox organic electrode materials (OEMs) have attracted extensive attention for batteries due to the possibility to be designed with high performance. However, the practical application of OEMs requires rigor criteria such as low cost, recyclability, scalability and high performance etc. and hence seems still far away. Here, we demonstrate an OEM for high performance aqueous organic batteries. Quantification of the charge storage confirmed the storage of protons with fast reaction kinetics, thereby enabling the high performance at high mass loading. As a result, the laminated pouch cells delivered Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity with excellent cycling performance. Benefited from the small molecular nature and the stable both charged and discharged states, the electrodes can be recycled at any states of charge with high yields (more than 90%). This work provides a substantial step in the practical applications of OEMs for the future sustainable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Dithioacetal Polymers via Reversible Entropy&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a sustainable circular economy, polymers capable of chemical recycling to monomers are highly desirable. We report an efficient monomer&#8208;polymer recycling of polydithioacetal (PDTA). Pristine PDTAs were readily synthesized from 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzaldehyde and alkyl dithiols. They then exhibited depolymerizability via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization into macrocycles, followed by entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) to reform the virgin polymers. High conversions were obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions. Once crosslinked, the network exhibited thermal reprocessability enabled by acid&#8208;catalyzed dithioacetal exchange. The network retained the recyclability into macrocyclic monomers in solvent which can repolymerize to regenerate the crosslinked network. These results demonstrated PDTA as a new molecular platform for the design of recyclable polymers and the advantages of ED&#8208;ROP for which polymerization is favored at higher temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Tubular Flow System with Replaceable Photocatalyst Membranes for Scalable Coupling and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals at lab&#8208;scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0th&#8208;order reaction kinetics and a high space&#8208;time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization for Hydrogel Synthesis through Barriers and Development of Light&#8208;Regulated Healable Hydrogels under NIR Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an aqueous and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated photoinduced reversible addition&#8722;fragmentation chain transfer (photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS4&#8722;) in the presence of peroxides. Taking advantage of its fast polymerization rates and high oxygen tolerance, this system is successfully applied for the preparation of hydrogels. Exploiting the enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through non&#8208;transparent biological barriers. Notably, the RAFT agents embedded in these hydrogel networks can be reactivated on&#8208;demand, enabling the hydrogel healing under NIR light irradiation. In contrast to the minimal healing capability (&lt; 15%) of hydrogels prepared by free radical polymerization (FRP), RAFT&#8208;mediated networks display more than 80% recovery of tensile strength. Although healable polymer networks under UV and blue lights have already been established, this work is the first photochemistry system using NIR light, facilitating photoinduced healing of hydrogels through thick non&#8208;transparent barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Exposed Zinc Sites on Hybrid ZnIn2S4@CdS Nanocages for Efficient Regioselective Photocatalytic Epoxide Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8211;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti&#8208;tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8211;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the establishment of Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the interface charge separation and transfer. Remarkably, the underlying regioselective photocatalytic reaction pathway has been distinctly revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x= 2&#8208;6) Units Realizing Giant Birefringence with Transparency in the Near&#8208;Infrared for Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto&#8208;electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials are still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x = 2&#8208;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs2S6 realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064 nm together with a wide bandgap of 1.70 eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual&#8208;anion group polysulfide Na4Ba3(S2)4S3 was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8208;6.2 &#956;m), wide band gap (2.3 eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064 nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>[n]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Pillar[5]arene Bismacrocycles: Their Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Multiple Guest Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both pillar[n]arenes (P[n]As) and [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) play an important role in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report the precise synthesis of two multifunctional bismacrocycles [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A by integrating P[5]A into the [n]CPP backbone. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of the bismacrocycles was found to show a dramatic increase relative to the corresponding [n]CPPs. The chiral enantiomers (pR)/(pS)&#8208;[8]CPP&#8208;P[5]A were successfully isolated by chiral HPLC, and showed promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum ~ 0.02). In addition, [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A bismacrocycles are capable of binding pyridinium salts and fullerene derivatives with high affinity and specificity within the two distinct cavities. Transient absorption studies showed that photo&#8208;induced electron transfer occurs in [10]CPP&#8208;P[5]A&#8835;C60 complex. Our results suggest that [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A are potentially useful in CPL&#8208;active materials, multiple guest recognition and supramolecular polymer preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iridium/Aluminum Cooperative Strategy for the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>

         <dc:description>Despite the widespread success in the functionalization of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds, the deliberate functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a highly site&#8208; and stereoselective manner remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, we report an iridium/aluminum cooperative catalyst system that enables the &#946;&#8208;selective C&#8211;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines and lactams. Furthermore, we have accomplished an enantioselective variant using binaphthol&#8208;derived chiral aluminum catalysts to forge C&#8722;B bonds with high levels of stereocontrol.

         <title>An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co&#8208;related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor&#8208;targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT&#8208;116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT&#8208;116 in vivo.







Abstract
NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.

Through all&#8208;atom enhanced molecular dynamics simulations guided by statistical mechanics and information theory, they were able to explain the mechanistic basis of this perplexing observation.

         <title>Charge Makes a Difference: Molecular Ionic Bismuth Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged molecular bismuth species encompass cationic and anionic complexes with organic and inorganic ligand spheres as well as ligand&#8208;free molecular clusters. This review provides an overview of their syntheses, structures, and bonding modes. It outlines how the heavy metal bismuth, with its capability of forming non&#8208;toxic compounds, can be understood as the key towards unique reactivity and sustainable applications.







Abstract
Key challenges in modern synthetic chemistry include the design of reliable, selective, and more sustainable synthetic methods, as well as the development of promising candidates for new materials. Molecular bismuth compounds offer valuable opportunities as they show an intriguing spectrum of properties that is yet to be fully exploited: a soft character, a rich coordination chemistry, the availability of a broad variety of oxidation states (at least +V to &#8722;I) and formal charges (at least +3 to &#8722;3) at the Bi atoms, and reversible switching between multiple oxidation states. All this is paired with the status of a non&#8208;precious (semi&#8722;)metal of good availability and a tendency towards low toxicity. Recent findings show that some of these properties only come into reach, or can be substantially optimized, when charged compounds are specifically addressed. In this review, essential contributions to the synthesis, analyses, and utilization of ionic bismuth compounds are highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Charged molecular bismuth species encompass cationic and anionic complexes with organic and inorganic ligand spheres as well as ligand-free molecular clusters. This review provides an overview of their syntheses, structures, and bonding modes. It outlines how the heavy metal bismuth, with its capability of forming non-toxic compounds, can be understood as the key towards unique reactivity and sustainable applications.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key challenges in modern synthetic chemistry include the design of reliable, selective, and more sustainable synthetic methods, as well as the development of promising candidates for new materials. Molecular bismuth compounds offer valuable opportunities as they show an intriguing spectrum of properties that is yet to be fully exploited: a soft character, a rich coordination chemistry, the availability of a broad variety of oxidation states (at least +V to &#8722;I) and formal charges (at least +3 to &#8722;3) at the Bi atoms, and reversible switching between multiple oxidation states. All this is paired with the status of a non-precious (semi&#8722;)metal of good availability and a tendency towards low toxicity. Recent findings show that some of these properties only come into reach, or can be substantially optimized, when &lt;i&gt;charged&lt;/i&gt; compounds are specifically addressed. In this review, essential contributions to the synthesis, analyses, and utilization of ionic bismuth compounds are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turning the Inert Element Zinc into an Active Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Zn&#8722;N4 sites mediate transfer of electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to dissolved oxygen (DO). Self&#8208;oxidation of pollutants is realized along with PMS oxidation into singlet oxygen (1O2) and DO reduction into superoxide radicals (O2&#8901;&#8722;) for catalytic oxidation of contaminants. Resource consumption and residual sulfate anion (SO42&#8722;) formation are reduced.







Abstract
Amongst various Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the zinc (Zn)&#8208;related SACs have been barely reported due to the fully occupied 3d10 configuration of Zn2+ being inactive for the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Herein, the inert element Zn is turned into an active single&#8208;atom catalyst (SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC) for Fenton&#8208;like chemistry by forming an atomic Zn&#8722;N4 coordination structure. The SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC shows admirable Fenton&#8208;like activity in organic pollutant remediation, including self&#8208;oxidation and catalytic degradation by superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the single&#8208;atomic Zn&#8722;N4 site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration PMS toward dissolved oxygen (DO) to actuate DO reduction into O2&#8901;&#8722; and successive conversion into 1O2. This work inspires an exploration of efficient and stable Fenton&#8208;like SACs for sustainable and resource&#8208;saving environmental applications.

         <title>Lithium Aluminium Hydride and Metallic Iron: A Powerful Team in Alkene and Arene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium aluminium hydride is well&#8208;known as a stoichiometric reducing agent for ketones. In combination with finely divided Fe0 it is a powerful catalyst for hydrogenation of challenging alkenes or even arenes. The actual catalyst is a thermal decomposition product of LiAlH4 and Fe0. The preactivated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst is also active under mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Alkenes that normally do not react with LiAlH4 (3&#8208;hexene, cyclohexene, 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene), can be reduced to the corresponding alkanes by a mixture of LiAlH4 and Fe0 (the iron was activated by Metal&#8208;Vapour&#8208;Synthesis). This alkene&#8208;to&#8208;alkane conversion with a stoichiometric quantity of LiAlH4/Fe0 does not need quenching with water or acids, implying that both H's originate from LiAlH4. The LiAlH4/Fe0 combination is also a remarkably potent cooperative catalyst for hydrogenation of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes and benzene or toluene. An induction period of circa two hours and the minimally required temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C, suggests that the actual catalyst is a combination of Fe0 and the decomposition product of LiAlH4 (LiH and Al0). A thermally pre&#8208;activated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst did not need an induction time and is also active at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar H2. A combination of AliBu3 and Fe0 is an even more active hydrogenation catalyst. Without pre&#8208;activation, tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes like Me2C=CMe2 and toluene could be fully hydrogenated.

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Desulfurization Method Reminiscent of Aquatic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be efficiently achieved under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer by micromolar concentrations of iron. The desulfurization mechanism likely involves iron(III) species produced through the oxidation of iron(II)&#8208;carbonate complexes by molecular oxygen and is reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters.







Abstract
One pillar of protein chemical synthesis based on the application of ligation chemistries to cysteine is the group of reactions enabling the selective desulfurization of cysteine residues into alanines. Modern desulfurization reactions use a phosphine as a sink for sulfur under activation conditions involving the generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. Here we show that cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be effected efficiently by micromolar concentrations of iron under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer, that is using conditions that are reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters. Therefore, our work shows that chemical processes taking place in aquatic systems can be adapted to a chemical reactor for triggering a complex chemoselective transformation at the protein level, while minimizing the resort to harmful chemicals.

         <title>Insights into the Role of Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photobase in Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in (sp3)C&#8722;H Oxygenation of Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation of oxazolidinones to corresponding oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones is enabled by mpg&#8208;CN, a carbon nitride photocatalyst, using oxygen gas as an oxidant. The reaction proceeds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The mechanism of this transformation is established by photocatalytic experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) is a transition metal free semiconductor that mediates a variety of photocatalytic reactions. Although photoinduced electron transfer is often postulated in the mechanism, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a more favorable pathway for substrates possessing X&#8722;H bonds. Upon excitation of an (sp2)N&#8208;rich structure of g&#8208;CN with visible light, it behaves as a photobase&#8212;it undergoes reductive quenching accompanied by abstraction of a proton from a substrate. The results of modeling allowed us to identify active sites for PCET&#8212;the &#8216;triangular pockets&#8217; on the edge facets of g&#8208;CN. We employ excited state PCET from the substrate to g&#8208;CN to selectively cleavethe endo&#8208;(sp3)C&#8722;H bond in oxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;ones followed by trapping the radical with O2. This reaction affords 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones. Measurement of the apparent pKa value and modeling suggest that g&#8208;CN excited state can cleave X&#8722;H bonds that are characterized by bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) &#8776;100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymerization Accompanying Chirality Transfer in Heterostructures via Living Chain Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of tetraphenylethylene containing glycine (TPE&#8208;G) and/or d&#8208;/l&#8208;alanine moieties not only leads to the formation of supramolecular multi&#8208;blocks copolymers (BCPs; tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;blocks) by chain&#8208;growth process, but also transfers chirality at the seed end.







Abstract
We report the unique synthesis of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with controllable chirality using kinetically adjusted seeded supramolecular copolymerization in THF and DMSO (99&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v). Tetraphenylethylene (d&#8208; and l&#8208;TPE) derivatives bearing d&#8208; and l&#8208;alanine side chains formed thermodynamically favored chiral products via a kinetically trapped in monomeric state with a long lag phase. In contrast, achiral TPE&#8208;G containing glycine moieties did not form a supramolecular polymer owing to the energy barrier in its kinetically trapped state. We show that the copolymerization of the metastable states of TPE&#8208;G not only enables the generation of supramolecular BCPs by the seeded living growth method, but also transfers chirality at the seed ends. This research demonstrates the generation of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C block patterns accompanying chirality transfer via seeded living polymerization.

         <title>Allosterically Regulated Guest Binding Determines Framework Symmetry for an FeII4L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic cages are an important class of synthetic hosts, which are able to mimic the structural adaptability and allosteric regulation of naturally occurring systems. A low&#8208;symmetry FeII4L4 tetrahedral cage reported here was able to adapt its geometry from S4 to C3 or T symmetry upon guest binding; multiple binding sites allowed the host to simultaneously bind distinct guests with negative allostery.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a flexible tritopic aniline and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;formylpyridine subcomponents around iron(II) templates gave rise to a low&#8208;spin FeII4L4 capsule, whereas a high&#8208;spin FeII3L2 sandwich species formed when a sterically hindered 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;formylpyridine was used. The FeII4L4 cage adopted a new structure type with S4 symmetry, having two mer&#8208;&#916; and two mer&#8208;&#581; metal vertices, as confirmed by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The flexibility of the face&#8208;capping ligand endows the resulting FeII4L4 framework with conformational plasticity, enabling it to adapt structurally from S4 to T or C3 symmetry upon guest binding. The cage also displayed negative allosteric cooperativity in simultaneously binding different guests within its cavity and at the apertures between its faces.

         <title>Reducing Overpotential of Solid&#8208;State Sulfide Conversion in Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving kinetics of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion in sulfur cathodes can enhance sulfur utilization and promote Coulombic efficiency of secondary metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, fundamental mechanisitic understanding of the solid&#8208;state conversion in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium&#8208;sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid&#8208;state K2S3 to K2S conversion via the meta&#8208;stable S2&#8208;3 intermediates on a range of transition metal single&#8208;atom catalytic sulfur hosts. The resultant catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrate high discharge capacities of 1,595 and 1226 mAh g&#8208;1 at specific current densitieis of 335 and 1675 mA g&#8208;1, respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of ~100% during cycling. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory computations reveal that the Cu single atom catalyst exhibits a relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding during sulfur redox conversion, resulting in low overpotential of solid&#8208;state K2S3&#8208;K2S conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of reaction mechanism of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimension Engineering of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 1D Molecular Crystals into Unusual 2D and 3D Zigzag Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate an innovative technique to achieve organic 2D and 3D waveguides with peculiar shapes from an acicular, light&#8208;stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular crystal, (2Z,2&#8217;Z)&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;(anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diyl)bis(2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacrylonitrile), Ant&#8208;CF3. The greenish&#8208;yellow fluorescent (FL) Ant&#8208;CF3 molecular crystals exhibit laser power&#8208;dependent permanent mechanical bending in 2D and 3D. Investigation of a single&#8208;crystal using spatially&#8208;resolved Raman/FL/electron microscopy, and theoretical calculations revealed photothermal (Z,E)/(E,E) isomerization&#8208;assisted transition from crystalline to amorphous phase at the laser&#8208;exposed regions. This phenomenon facilitates the dimension engineering of a 1D crystal waveguide into a 2D waveguide on a substrate or a 3D waveguide in free space. The presented technique has broader implications in organic photonics and other crystal&#8208;related technologies at large.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coordination Polymer of Vaska&#8217;s Complex as a Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Reductive Formation of Enamines from Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LVMOFs) and related materials have gained interest due to their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. &#160;However, of the rare examples of LVMOFs that have been reported, none have shown catalytic activity. &#160;A low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material constructed from phosphine linkers and Ir(I) nodes is reported. &#160;This material is effectively a crystalline, insoluble analogue of Vaska's complex. &#160;As such, this material reversibly binds O2 and catalyzes the reductive formation of enamines from amides.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Human Cells at Near&#8208;Physiological Concentrations with&#160;Sensitive 19F NMR Chemical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is an effective tool for observing proteins at atomic resolution in their native cellular environment. However, its utility is limited by its low sensitivity and the extensive line broadening caused by nonspecific interactions in the cells, which is even more pronounced in human cells due to the difficulty of overexpressing or delivering high concentrations of isotopically labeled proteins. Here, we present a high&#8208;sensitivity tag (wPSP&#8208;6F) containing two trifluoromethyl groups that can efficiently label globular proteins with molecular weights in the 6&#8208;40 kDa range under mild conditions. This tag allowed us to detect globular proteins in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0 &#956;M, which would not have been achievable with 15N or 3&#8208;fluorotyrosine labeling. Moreover, we detected conformational changes and interactions of proteins in the cellular environment. The new sensitive 19F NMR tag may significantly expand the scope of protein NMR in human cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Triangular Single&#8208;Layer 2D Assemblies: Synthesis and Their Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Elastic and Anisotropic Curling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of highly stable single&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional assemblies (SLAs) is a key challenge in supramolecular science, especially those with long&#8208;range molecular order and well&#8208;defined morphology. Here, thin (thickness &lt; 2 nm) triangular Au(I)&#8208;thiolate SLAs with high thermo&#8208;, solvato&#8208; and mechano&#8208; stability have been synthesized via a double&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, the SLAs show assembly&#8208;level elastic and anisotropic deformation responses to external stimuli as a result of the long&#8208;range anisotropic molecular packing, which provides SLAs with new application potentials in bio&#8208;mimic nanomechanics.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Energy Conversion Efficiency and Durability of Alkaline Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries with Air&#8208;Breathing Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their high output voltage and safety advantages, rechargeable alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries face significant challenges associated with the cathodic side reaction of oxygen evolution, which results in low energy efficiency (EE) and poor stability. Herein, we propose to leverage the side oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in nickel&#8208;zinc batteries by coupling electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the cathode, thus constructing an air breathing cathode. Such&#160;a&#160;novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB), designed in a pouch&#8208;type cell with a lean electrolyte, exhibits an outstanding EE of 85% and a long cycle life of 100 cycles at 2 mA cm&#8208;2, which are significantly superior to those of traditional Ni&#8208;Zn batteries (54%, 50 cycles). Compared to Ni&#8208;Zn, the enhanced EE of Ni&#8208;ZnAB is attributed to the contribution from ORR, while the improved cycling stability is because the stability of the anode, cathode and electrolyte are also enhanced in Ni&#8208;ZnAB. Furthermore, an ultrahigh stability of 500 cycles with an average EE of 84% at 2 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;was achieved using a mold cell with rich electrolyte, demonstrating the strong application potential of Ni&#8208;ZnAB.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dipole Engineering of Carbonyl Additives for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl functional materials as additives are extensively applied to reduce the defects density of the perovskite film. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding for the effect of carbonyl additives to improve device performance. In this work, we systematically study the effect of carbonyl additive molecules on the passivation of defects in perovskite films. After a comprehensive investigation, the results confirm the importance of molecular dipole in amplifying the passivation effect of additive molecules. The additive with strong molecular dipole possesses the advantages of enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). After optimization, the companion efficiency of PSCs is 23.20%, and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell module&#8208;modified DLBA was 20.18% (14 cm2). This work provides an important reference for the selection and designing of efficient carbonyl additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Copper Photoredox Catalysts for Iminyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binap&#8208;ligated copper dimer has been heterogenized on a pillar&#8208;layered MOF surface for the first time using a hydroxamic acid linker. This MOF&#8208;supported dimeric copper photocatalyst demonstrates much higher activity and recyclability than its homogeneous counterparts in intra&#8208; and intermolecular radical reactions of N&#8208;acyloxy imidates and O&#8208;acyl oximes.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light copper photocatalysis has recently emerged as a viable technology for building sustainable synthetic processes. To broaden the applications of phosphine&#8208;ligated copper(I) complexes, we describe herein an effective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported copper(I) photocatalyst for multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions. Due to site isolation, the heterogenized copper photosensitizer has a significantly higher catalytic activity than its homogeneous counterpart. Using a hydroxamic acid linker to immobilize copper species on MOF supports affords the heterogeneous catalysts with high recyclability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification sequence on MOF surfaces allows for the preparation of previously unavailable monomeric copper species. Our findings highlight the potential of using MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalytic systems to address fundamental challenges in the development of synthetic methodologies and mechanistic investigations of transition&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Augmenting the Performance of Hydrogenase for Aerobic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Solvent Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are shown to be superior solvents for solar hydrogen generation using natural hydrogenase enzymes. This &#8220;inDEStructible&#8221; system demonstrates that DES&#8208;based engineered solvents stabilise hydrogenase towards oxygen and enable efficient H2 generation in air.







Abstract
This work showcases the performance of [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in a variety of organic&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. Despite its well&#8208;known sensitivity towards air and organic solvents, the hydrogenase shows remarkable performance under an aerobic atmosphere in these solvents when paired with a TiO2 photocatalyst. Tuning the water content further increases hydrogen evolution activity to a TOF of 60&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 and quantum yield to 2.3&#177;0.4&#8201;% under aerobic conditions, compared to a TOF of 4&#8197;s&#8722;1 in a purely aqueous solvent. Contrary to common belief, this work therefore demonstrates that placing natural hydrogenases into non&#8208;natural environments can enhance their intrinsic activity beyond their natural performance, paving the way for full water splitting using hydrogenases.

         <title>The Rigid Core and Flexible Surface of Amyloid Fibrils Probed by Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Spectroscopy of Aromatic Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rock&#8208;solid amyloid fibrils? Aromatic ring flips are a hallmark of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; in proteins. But does the infinitely long &#946;&#8208;sheet structure of amyloids allow for such motions? In their Article, Becker et&#8197;al. apply specific isotope labeling and solid&#8208;state NMR to two amyloid fibrils to demonstrate that the motion of aromatic rings strongly differs between the core and the surface of the fibril.







Abstract
Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8211;protein interactions. We studied aromatic residues in the two structurally homologous cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid fibrils HET&#8208;s, and HELLF by employing a specific isotope&#8208;labeling approach and magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning NMR. The dynamic behavior of the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr indicates that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips on a variety of time scales from nanoseconds to microseconds. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic&#8208;core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from an NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross&#8208;&#946; architecture.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Trifluoromethoxylation of Propargyl Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, great challenges still remained for direct asymmetric trifluoromethoxylation with only two successful reports since the first discovery. Here, by subtly tuning the leaving group, protecting group, ligand structure, reaction temperature, solvent and base, we finally realized a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates for the first time.







Abstract
Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity of trifluoromethoxy group (OCF3), methods for introducing OCF3 into organic molecules are in high demand. However, the research area of direct enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation is still in the embryonic stage, with limited enantioselectivity and/or reaction types. Here, we describe the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates using trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) as the trifluoromethoxy source in up to 96&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Closing the Cycle as It Begins: Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Iodobiaryls via Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the Catellani reactions has enabled the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls starting from aryl iodides and bromides. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation (32 examples and 6 subsequent derivatizations), a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halide complexes.







Abstract
Despite the advances in the field of carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis. This new example of Catellani reaction features the initial cleavage of a C(sp2)&#8722;I bond, followed by the key formation of a palladacycle through ortho C&#8722;H activation, the oxidative addition of an aryl bromide and the ultimate restoration of the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond. A large variety of valuable o&#8208;iodobiaryls has been synthesized in satisfactory to good yields and their derivatization have been described too. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation, a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the key reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halides complexes.

         <title>A Bioinspired Free&#8208;Standing 2D Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Polyimine Membrane for Selective Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of flexible dibenzo&#8208;14&#8208;crown&#8208;4&#8208;ether moieties into a rigid framework has led to the generation of a bioinspired ultrathin membrane that allows proton transport. The interconnected hydrogen&#8208;bond/water networks and ideal binding sites result in the highly selective and fast transportation of protons through the membrane.







Abstract
Biological proton channels play important roles in the delicate metabolism process, and have led to great interest in mimicking selective proton transport. Herein, we designed a bioinspired proton transport membrane by incorporating flexible 14&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (14C4) units into rigid frameworks of polyimine films by an interfacial Schiff base reaction. The Young's modulus of the membrane reaches about 8.2&#8197;GPa. The 14C4 units could grab water, thereby forming hydrogen bond&#8208;water networks and acting as jumping sites to lower the energy barrier of proton transport. The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi&#8208;planar molecular sheets. Furthermore, the 14C4 moieties could bond alkali ions through host&#8211;guest interactions. Thus, the ion conductance follows H+&#8811;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+, and an ultrahigh selectivity of H+/Li+ (ca. 215) is obtained. This study provides an effective avenue for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes by embedding macrocycle motifs with inherent cavities.

         <title>The Self&#8208;Association of the KRAS4b Protein is Altered by Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Composition and Electrostatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of the peripheral membrane protein KRAS4b promotes oncogenic signaling. Using nanodiscs to enable paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments, we show that KRAS4b dimers associate through distinct conformations depending on lipid composition. Both states involve the &#945;4&#8208;&#945;5 interface, however increasing phosphatidylserine concentration alters the relative protomer orientation, shifting R135 electrostatic interactions from D153 to E168.







Abstract
KRAS is a peripheral membrane protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways, and is mutated in &#8776;30&#8201;% of cancers. Transient self&#8208;association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self&#8208;assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self&#8208;association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the &#8220;&#945;4/5&#8208;&#945;4/5&#8221; interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge&#8208;reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;Static Planar Chirality Conversion in Pillar[5]arenes Regulated by Guest Solvents or Amplified by Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pR and pS forms of pillar[5]arene regulated by short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain guest solvents, respectively, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups through click reactions. The diastereomeric excess was also amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded a pillar[5]arene with excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8197;de).







Abstract
Controlling dynamic chirality and memorizing the controlled chirality are important. Chirality memory has mainly been achieved using noncovalent interactions. However, in many cases, the memorized chirality arising from noncovalent interactions is erased by changing the conditions such as the solvent and temperature. In this study, the dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes was successfully converted into static planar chirality by introducing bulky groups through covalent bonds. Before introducing the bulky groups, pillar[5]arene with stereogenic carbon atoms at both rims existed as a pair of diastereomers, and thus showed planar chiral inversion that was dependent on the chain length of the guest solvent. The pS and pR forms, regulated by guest solvents, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups. Furthermore, the diastereomeric excess was amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded pillar[5]arene with an excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8201;de).

         <title>Surface Engineering of Titania Boosts Electroassisted Propane Dehydrogenation at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8722;In nanoalloy supported on Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 is a highly efficient catalyst for electroassisted propane dehydrogenation. Surface doping of Sm3+ enriched the surface proton density on TiO2 by charge compensation, which boosted propane dehydrogenation by accelerating proton collision on propane due to enhanced surface protonics. A propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was achieved at 300&#8201;&#176;C, which is far beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation.







Abstract
Electric field catalysis using surface proton conduction, in which proton hopping and collision on the reactant are promoted by external electricity, is a promising approach to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation in endothermic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study proposes a catalyst design concept for more efficient electroassisted PDH at low temperature. Sm was doped into the anatase TiO2 surface to increase surface proton density by charge compensation. Pt&#8722;In alloy was deposited on the Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 for more favorable proton collision and selective propylene formation. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH drastically increased by doping an appropriate amount of Sm (1&#8197;mol&#8201;% to Ti) where the highest propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was obtained at 300&#8201;&#176;C where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield was only 0.5&#8201;%. Results show that surface proton enrichment boosts alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature.

         <title>Spontaneous Chirality Induction in the Assembly of a Single Layer 2D Network with Switchable Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer chiral 2D network structures with photoswitchable internal cavities have been formed by the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene&#8208;based tetrapod aromatic amphiphiles, with spontaneous chirality induction arising from the breaking of both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The chiral network structures can selectively catch one enantiomer from a racemic solution and then release it upon UV irradiation through reversible pore deformation.







Abstract
Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral sheet structures are attractive because of their unique chemical and physical properties, single layer 2D chiral network structures with switchable pore interior remain elusive. Here we report spontaneous chirality induction in a single layer 2D network structure formed from the self&#8208;assembly of tetrapod azobenzene molecules. The chirality induction arises from multiple sublayers slipped in a preferred direction in which the sublayer consists of unidentical molecular arrangements in the in&#8208;plane a and b directions, breaking both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The protruded azobenzene units in the pore interior can be selectively isomerized upon UV irradiation, resulting in a reversible deformation of the chiral pores while maintaining the 2D frameworks. The chiral network can thus selectively entrap one enantiomer from a racemic solution with near perfect enantioselectivity, and then release it upon UV irradiation.

         <title>Targeting the Dark Lipid Kinase PIP4K2C with a Potent and Selective Binder and Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One obstacle to a better understanding of the &#8220;dark&#8221; lipid kinase PIP4K2C is the lack of chemical tool compounds for this protein. Here, we describe a picomolar PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, and an effective bivalent PIP4K2C degrader, TMX&#8208;4153, both of which display exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Thus, TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 represent two useful leads to further interrogate the therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol 5&#8208;phosphate 4&#8208;kinase, type II, gamma (PIP4K2C) remains a poorly understood lipid kinase with minimal enzymatic activity but potential scaffolding roles in immune modulation and autophagy&#8208;dependent catabolism. Achieving potent and selective agents for PIP4K2C while sparing other lipid and non&#8208;lipid kinases has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of the highly potent PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, which shows exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Furthermore, we elaborated the PIP4K2C binder into TMX&#8208;4153, a bivalent degrader capable of rapidly and selectively degrading endogenous PIP4K2C. Collectively, our work demonstrates that PIP4K2C is a tractable and degradable target, and that TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 are useful leads to further interrogate the biological roles and therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.

Methane dehydrogenation over boron nitride nanosheets proceeds via N&#8722;H surface bonds, which function as a hydrogen bonding trap to impede cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds and hinder continuous dehydrogenation. Electrons from the BN surface are injected into the antibonding orbitals of N&#8722;H bonds; thereby, the overoxidation of products into thermodynamically favored CO2 is significantly suppressed.







Abstract
Restrained by uncontrollable dehydrogenation process, the target products of methane direct conversion would suffer from an inevitable overoxidation, which is deemed as one of the most challenging issues in catalysis. Herein, based on the concept of a hydrogen bonding trap, we proposed a novel concept to modulate the methane conversion pathway to hinder the overoxidation of target products. Taking boron nitride as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept model, for the first time it is found that the designed N&#8722;H bonds can work as a hydrogen bonding trap to attract electrons. Benefitting from this property, the N&#8722;H bonds on the BN surface rather than C&#8722;H bonds in formaldehyde prefer to cleave, greatly suppressing the continuous dehydrogenation process. More importantly, formaldehyde will combine with the released protons, which leads to a proton rebound process to regenerate methanol. As a result, BN shows a high methane conversion rate (8.5&#8201;%) and nearly 100&#8201;% product selectivity to oxygenates under atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement from Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diads Decorated with Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as an Electrochemical Protector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of electrochemical protectors was demonstrated with a classical Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, which was mounted on donor&#8208;acceptor emitters to greatly stabilize electrogenerated radicals and enhancement of the Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Electrochemical doping in segregated emitter&#8208;B(C6F5)3 co&#8208;assemblies afforded a crystalline film showing ECL through singlet exciton delocalization derived from columnar &#960;&#8208;stacks.







Abstract
This study reports an effective peripheral decoration of organic donor&#8208;acceptor diads with B(C6F5)3 for stabilizing electrogenerated radical ions. By employing a common p&#8208;type organic semiconductor benzothienobenzothiophene (BTBT) as the donor, tetracoordinate boron complexes showed improved solution electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity, reaching a 156&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the parent diad. The unprecedented Lewis&#8208;pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement is attributed to the multiple roles of B(C6F5)3: 1)&#8197;redistributing frontier orbitals, 2)&#8197;facilitating electrochemical excitation, and 3)&#8197;restricting molecular motions. Furthermore, B(C6F5)3 converted the molecular arrangement of BTBT from conventional 2D herringbones into 1D &#960;&#8208;stacks. This robust, highly ordered columnar nanostructure allowed red&#8208;shifting of the crystalline film ECL with electrochemical doping through the electronic coupling pathways of BTBT. Our approach will facilitate the development of elaborate metal&#8208;free ECL systems.

         <title>Optical and Electrochemical Probes for Monitoring Cytochrome&#8197;c in Subcellular Compartments During Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c)&#8208;sensing probes consisting of fluorescent caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer frameworks or redox&#8208;active caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer&#8208;functionalized nanoelectrodes are introduced. Light&#8208;activated, spatially confined, optical or electrochemical detection of Cyt.&#8201;c, in cellular subdomains, at the single cell level are demonstrated. The analytical tools are applied to monitor intracellular Cyt.&#8201;c translocation upon cell apoptosis.







Abstract
Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c) is a key initiator of the caspases that activate cell apoptosis. The spatiotemporal evaluation of the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments and the detection of Cyt.&#8201;c delivery between cellular compartments upon apoptosis is important for probing cell viabilities. We introduce an optical probe and an electrochemical probe for the quantitative assessment of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments at the single cell level. The optical or electrochemical probes are functionalized with photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzylphosphate ester&#8208;caged Cyt.&#8201;c aptamer constituents. These are uncaged by light stimuli at single cell compartments, allowing the spatiotemporal detection of Cyt.&#8201;c through the formation of Cyt.&#8201;c/aptamer complexes at non&#8208;apoptotic or apoptotic conditions. The probes are applied to distinguish the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments of epithelial MCF&#8208;10A breast cells and malignant MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cells under apoptotic/non&#8208;apoptotic conditions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of an Octagermacubane with Two Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanium(0) Atoms and its Unique Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis of an octagermacubane, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms, by the thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(silyl)germane and bis(silyl)germane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, is reported. Reduction of the octagermacubane with tBuMe2SiNa yields the first X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of a Ge&#8208;centered octagermacubane radical anion.







Abstract
Thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 9 and bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 17 at 100&#8201;&#176;C produces unexpectedly octagermacubane 18, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms (40&#8201;% yield). 18 was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and it is a singlet biradical (according to DFT quantum mechanical calculations and the absence of an EPR signal). Reactions of 18 with CH2Cl2 and H2O yield the novel dichloro&#8208;octagermacubane 24 and hydroxy&#8208;octagermacubane 25, respectively. Reduction of 18 with tBuMe2SiNa in THF produces an isolable octagermacubane radical anion 26&#8208;Na. Based on X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy and DFT quantum mechanical calculations, 26&#8208;Na is classified as a Ge&#8208;centered radical anion.

         <title>Development of a Versatile Protein Labeling Tool for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging Using Fluorescent &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile protein labeling system was developed using non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors. Fluorophore&#8208;diazabicyclooctane prodrug conjugates efficiently and stably labeled &#946;&#8208;lactamase tag&#8208;fused proteins localized in various intracellular compartments in living cells. Furthermore, use of a pH&#8208;activatable fluorophore allowed visualization of lysosomal protein trafficking at the late stage of autophagy under cellular starvation.







Abstract
To understand the function of protein in live cells, real&#8208;time monitoring of protein dynamics and sensing of their surrounding environment are important methods. Fluorescent labeling tools are thus needed that possess fast labeling kinetics, high efficiency, and long&#8208;term stability. We developed a versatile chemical protein&#8208;labeling tool based on fluorophore&#8208;conjugated diazabicyclooctane &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and wild&#8208;type TEM&#8208;1 &#946;&#8208;lactamase protein tag. The fluorescent probes efficiently formed a stable carbamoylated complex with &#946;&#8208;lactamase, and the labeled proteins were visualized over a long period of time in live cells. Moreover, use of an &#945;&#8208;fluorinated carboxylate ester&#8208;based BLI prodrug enabled the probe to permeate cell membranes and stably label intracellular proteins after unexpected spontaneous ester hydrolysis. Lastly, combining the labeling tool with a pH&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe allowed visual monitoring of lysosomal protein translocation during autophagy.

We developed a versatile chemical protein-labeling tool based on fluorophore-conjugated diazabicyclooctane &#946;-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and wild-type TEM-1 &#946;-lactamase protein tag. The fluorescent probes efficiently formed a stable carbamoylated complex with &#946;-lactamase, and the labeled proteins were visualized over a long period of time in live cells. Moreover, use of an &#945;-fluorinated carboxylate ester-based BLI prodrug enabled the probe to permeate cell membranes and stably label intracellular proteins after unexpected spontaneous ester hydrolysis. Lastly, combining the labeling tool with a pH-activatable fluorescent probe allowed visual monitoring of lysosomal protein translocation during autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering on Solvation Structure of Carbonate Electrolyte toward Durable Sodium Metal Battery at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte is designed by molecular engineering of solvated structure. By introducing the additive ethylene sulfate, the sodium ion diffusion barrier is lowered and strong solid electrolyte interphase is formed, inhibiting sodium dendrite growth. The as&#8208;fabricated cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;cycle performance at a low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Carbonate electrolytes have excellent chemical stability and high salt solubility, which are ideally practical choice for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium (Na) metal battery at room temperature. However, their application at ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C) is adversely affected by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by electrolyte decomposition and the difficulty of desolvation. Here, we designed a novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte by molecular engineering on solvation structure. The calculations and experimental results demonstrate that ethylene sulfate (ES) reduces the sodium ion desolvation energy and promotes the forming of more inorganic substances on the Na surface, which promote ion migration and inhibit dendrite growth. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the Na||Na symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle of 1500&#8197;hours, and the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) battery achieves 88.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Isolation of Structurally Heterogeneous TCR&#8208;CD3 Extracellular Vesicle Subpopulations Using Caliper Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with different T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 oligomerization states has been verified by a proposed caliper strategy. Using a caliper probe with an optimized spacing of 16&#8197;nm, the strategy successfully isolated TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric EVs (mCD3 EVs) and TCR&#8208;CD3 dimeric EVs (dCD3 EVs) from the plasma of a skin transplantation mouse model. Phenotypic analysis confirmed dCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker for acute cellular rejection.







Abstract
Cells in different states can release diverse types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in intracellular communication or pathological processes. The identification and isolation of EV subpopulations are significant to explore their physiological functions and clinical value. In this study, structurally heterogeneous T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 EVs were proposed and verified for the first time using a caliper strategy. Two CD3&#8208;targeting aptamers were designed in the shape of a caliper with an optimized probe distance and were assembled on gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;Caliper) to distinguish TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric and dimeric EVs (m/dCD3 EVs) in skin&#8208;transplanted mouse plasma. Phenotyping and sequencing analysis revealed clear heterogeneity in the isolated m/dCD3 EVs, providing the potential for mCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and holding great prospects for distinguishing EV subpopulations based on protein oligomerization states.

Enantiopure (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) [6]helicene with an seven&#8208;membered ring and carbo[7]helicene have been simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99&#8201;%) synthesized with opposite helicity from optically pure doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors. The stepwise acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne annulations involved a complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, which led to the helicity being fully stereo&#8208;controlled.







Abstract
Enantiopure [6]helicene containing an embedded seven&#8208;membered ring and carbo[7]helicene (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) with opposite helicity were simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99&#8201;%) synthesized with a perfect stereospecificity through stepwise acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne annulations of doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors. The helical handedness of the [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes was fully stereocontrolled by the doubly axial chirality of the precursors as a result of complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer. The cyclizations proceeded in a stepwise manner; the first six&#8208;membered ring formation was followed by the kinetically controlled seven&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring formation with or without helix&#8208;inversion of a [4]helicene intermediate generated during the first cyclization step, thus quantitatively producing enantiopure circularly polarized luminescent [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes with opposite helicity.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Nitrooxylation: Noncyclic Hypervalent Iodine Nitrooxylating Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagent is prepared from aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. This reagent facilitates the zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers with broad scope, and also can be used in the nitrooxylation of various enolizable C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Organic nitrates are broadly applied as pharmaceuticals (acting as efficient nitric oxide donor), energetic materials, building blocks in organic synthesis, etc. However, practical and direct methods to access organic nitrates efficiently are still rare, mainly due to the lack of powerful nitrooxylating reagents. Herein, we report bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagents, oxybis(aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanediyl) dinitrates (OAIDNs, 2), which are prepared just by using aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. The reagents are used to achieve a mild and operationally simple protocol to access diverse organic nitrates. By employing of 2, zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers is realized efficiently to access the corresponding &#946;&#8208;nitrooxy ketones with high functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, a series of direct and catalyst&#8208;free nitrooxylations of enolizable C&#8722;H bonds are carried out smoothly to afford the desired organic nitrates within minutes by just mixing the substrates with 2 in dichloromethane.

         <title>Spin Manipulation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Layer through Mechanical Exfoliation for Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of Fe3+ spin states from high spin (HS; s=5/2) in bulk crystals to mixed spin lattices (with s=5/2 and low spin (LS); s=1/2) is demonstrated in a two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layer catalyst by mechanical exfoliation. The resulting catalyst has enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction (CO2RR) over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Spin manipulation of transition&#8208;metal catalysts has great potential in mimicking enzyme electronic structures to improve activity and/or selectivity. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate room&#8208;temperature spin state of catalytic centers. Herein, we report a mechanical exfoliation strategy to in situ induce partial spin crossover from high&#8208;spin (s=5/2) to low&#8208;spin (s=1/2) of the ferric center. Due to spin transition of catalytic center, mixed&#8208;spin catalyst exhibits a high CO yield of 19.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with selectivity of 91.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of high&#8208;spin bulk counterpart (50&#8201;% selectivity). Density functional theory calculations reveal that low&#8208;spin 3d&#8208;orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in promoting CO2 adsorption and reducing activation barrier. Hence, the spin manipulation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.

&lt;p&gt;The manipulation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; spin states from high spin (HS; &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;=5/2) in bulk crystals to mixed spin lattices (with &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;=5/2 and low spin (LS); &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;=1/2) is demonstrated in a two-dimensional ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layer catalyst by mechanical exfoliation. The resulting catalyst has enhanced activity and selectivity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction (CO2RR) over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin manipulation of transition-metal catalysts has great potential in mimicking enzyme electronic structures to improve activity and/or selectivity. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate room-temperature spin state of catalytic centers. Herein, we report a mechanical exfoliation strategy to in situ induce partial spin crossover from high-spin (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=5/2) to low-spin (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=1/2) of the ferric center. Due to spin transition of catalytic center, mixed-spin catalyst exhibits a high CO yield of 19.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with selectivity of 91.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of high-spin bulk counterpart (50&#8201;% selectivity). Density functional theory calculations reveal that low-spin 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in promoting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and reducing activation barrier. Hence, the spin manipulation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Redox in Polyimide: Witness by In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;destructive in situ EPR technique is developed to directly observe the electronic signal conversion process of radical anions and dianions upon charge/discharge cycling, verifying the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reaction of polyimide electrodes in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Organic materials are promising candidates for future rechargeable batteries, owing to their high natural abundance and rapidly redox reaction. Elaborating the charge/discharge process of organic electrode is critical to unveil the fundamental redox mechanism of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but monitoring of this process is still challenging. Here, we report a nondestructive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to real&#8208;time detect the electron migration step within polyimide cathode. From in situ EPR tests, we vividly observe a classical redox reaction along with two&#8208;electron transfer which only shows one pair of peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve. The radical anion and dianion intermediates are detailed delineation at redox sites in EPR spectra, which can be further confirmed through density functional theory calculations. This approach is especially crucial to elaborate the correlation behind electrochemical and molecular structure for multistep organic&#8208;based LIBs.

Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices.

On this basis, we evaluate the

         <title>Multitargeted Platinum(IV) Anticancer Complexes Bearing Pyridinyl Ligands as Axial Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel pyridinyl PtIV complexes obtained by ligand exchange reactions could quickly be reduced to the PtII parent drugs. The axial pyridines acted as leaving group ligands and were utilized for designing multitargeted anticancer prodrugs. These multitargeted pyridinyl PtIV complexes were effective in killing Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth.







Abstract
Although multitargeted PtIV anticancer prodrugs have shown significant activities in reducing drug resistance, the types of bioactive ligands and drugs that can be conjugated to the Pt center remain limited to O&#8208;donors. Herein, we report the synthesis of PtIV complexes bearing axial pyridines via ligand exchange reactions. Unexpectedly, the axial pyridines are quickly released after reduction, indicating their potential to be utilized as axial leaving groups. We further expand our synthetic approach to obtaining two multitargeted PtIV prodrugs containing bioactive pyridinyl ligands: a PARP inhibitor and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; these conjugates exhibit great potential for overcoming drug resistance, and the latter conjugate inhibits the growth of Pt&#8208;resistant tumor in vivo. This research adds to the array of synthetic methods for accessing PtIV prodrugs and significantly increases the types of bioactive axial ligands that can be conjugated to a PtIV center.

         <title>A Quenched Size&#8208;Expanded Nucleotide Reports Activity of the Leukemia Biomarker Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT)
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogenic probe based on size&#8208;expanded adenosine is used to monitor activity of the leukemia biomarker and therapeutic target Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). The probe can measure TdT activity in cancer cell extract in real&#8208;time and report on its response to treatment. Use of the probe in a high&#8208;throughput screening led to the identification of the non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitor SCH202676.







Abstract
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) is a template&#8208;independent DNA polymerase that plays an essential role in the human adaptive immune system and is upregulated in several types of leukemia. It has therefore gained interest as a leukemia biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Herein, we describe a FRET&#8208;quenched fluorogenic probe based on a size&#8208;expanded deoxyadenosine that reports directly on TdT enzymatic activity. The probe enables real&#8208;time detection of primer extension and de novo synthesis activity of TdT and displays selectivity over other polymerase and phosphatase enzymes. Importantly, TdT activity and its response to treatment with a promiscuous polymerase inhibitor could be monitored in human T&#8208;lymphocyte cell extract and Jurkat cells using a simple fluorescence assay. Finally, employing the probe in a high&#8208;throughput assay resulted in the identification of a non&#8208;nucleoside TdT inhibitor.

         <title>Supercharged CO2 Photothermal catalytic Methanation: High Conversion, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic impediments of the Sabatier CO2 methanation reaction, the process must be operated under very high temperature and pressure conditions, to obtain an industrially viable conversion, rate, and selectivity. Herein, we report that these technologically relevant performance metrics have been achieved under much milder conditions using solar rather than thermal energy, where the methanation reaction is enabled by a novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride catalyst. In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis&#8217;s pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68%, reaction rate 2.03 mol gNi&#8208;1h&#8208;1, and near 100% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto&#8208;chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions through Sulfur&#8208;Anchoring of Metal Catalysts on Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In supported metal catalysts, the supports would strongly interact with the metal components instead of just acting as a carrier, which greatly affects both of their synthesis and catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Carbon is considered as very important but inert support and thus hard to induce strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomenon, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI between metal and sulfur&#8208;doped carbon (S&#8208;C) supports enables the catalysts with extraordinary resistance to sintering at high temperatures of up to 1,100 &#186;C, which allows the general synthesis of single&#8208;atom, alloy cluster, and intermetallic compound catalysts with high dispersion and metal loading for a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergizing Electron and Heat Flows in Photocatalyst for Direct Conversion of Captured CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a ternary hybrid photocatalyst architecture with tailored interfaces that boost the utilization of solar energy for photochemical CO2 reduction by synergizing electron and heat flows in the photocatalyst. The photocatalyst comprises cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) molecules assembled on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are decorated with nearly monodispersed cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs). The CdS QDs absorb visible light and generate electron&#8208;hole pairs. The CNTs rapidly transfer the photogenerated electrons from CdS to CoPc. The CoPc molecules then selectively reduce CO2 to CO. The interfacial dynamics and catalytic behavior are clearly revealed by time&#8208;resolved and in situ vibrational spectroscopies. In addition to serving as electron highways, the black body property of the CNT component can create local photothermal heating to activate amine&#8208;captured CO2, namely carbamates, for direct photochemical conversion without additional energy input.</dc:description>

         <title>Growing ZIF&#8208;8 Seeds on Charged COF Substrates toward Efficient Propylene&#8208;Propane Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a covalent organic framework (COF) induced seeding strategy to fabricate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes. Contrary to graphene oxide nuclei&#8208;depositing substrate, COF substrate has uniform pore size, high microporosity and abundant functional groups. We designed a series of charged COF nanosheets to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;8@COF nanosheet seeds with high aspect ratio over 150, which were readily processed into a compact and uniform seed layer. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with thickness down to 100 nm exhibit an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 separation performance and superior long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is also validated by fabricating ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;66 membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese(I) Catalyzed ortho C&#8211;H Allylation of Benzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 3d&#8208;metal catalyst Mn(CO)5Br was found to efficiently promote ortho C&#8211;H allylations of arenecarboxylates in the presence of neocuproine as the ligand. Despite the simplicity of directing group and catalyst system, the selectivity goes well beyond the state of the art in that mono&#8208;allylated products are obtained exclusively with high selectivities for the least hindered ortho&#8208;position. The directing group can optionally be removed by in situ decarboxylation, opening up a regioselective entry to allyl arenes. The preparative utility of the process and its othogonality to other approaches was demonstrated by 44 products with otherwise hard&#8208;to&#8208;access substitution patterns, including 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;allylbenzene, 3&#8208;allylbenzofuran, or 5&#8208;allyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylnitrobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Extracting Water from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue due to global population growth and industrialization. One effective approach to addressing this issue is sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of porous crystalline material that have emerged as promising sorbents for water harvesting due to their high surface area, tunable pore size, and customizable pore chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we provide an overview of the different types of COFs, their structural characteristics, and the diverse linkage chemistries used to construct them. Then, we summarize recent advances in using COF&#8208;based sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, including strategies for controlling sorption properties and optimizing performance in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges associated with improving the efficiency of COF&#8208;based SAWH systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Study of the Enhanced Reactivity of Turbo&#8208;Grignard Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its introduction in 2004, Knochel&#8217;s so called Turbo&#8208;Grignard reagents revolutionized the usage of Grignard reagents. Through the simple addition of LiCl to a magnesium alkyl an outstanding increase in reactivity can be achieved. Though the exact composition of the reactive species remained mysterious, the reactive mixture itself is readily used not only in synthesis but also found its way into more distant fields like material science. To unravel this mystery, we combined single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction with in&#8208;solution NMR&#8208;spectroscopy and closed our investigations with quantum chemical calculations. Using such a variety of methods, we gained insight into and an explanation for the extraordinary reactivity of this extremely convenient reagent by determining the structure of the first bimetallic reactive species&#160;[t&#8208;Bu2Mg &#8226; LiCl &#8226; 4 thf] with two tert&#8208;butyl anions at the magnesium center and incorporated lithium chloride.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Revival of Degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 to Stable Highly Luminescent Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 is regarded as an attractive optical luminophore, it is readily degraded to the optically inactive &#948;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions.&#160; Here, we present a simple approach to revive degraded (&#8220;optically sick&#8221;) &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 through &#8220;medication&#8221; with thiol&#8208;containing ligands. The effect of different types of thiols is systematically studied through optical spectroscopy. The structural reconstruction of degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals to cubic crystals in the presence of thiol&#8208;containing ligands is visualized through high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We found that 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH) effectively revives degraded CsPbI3 and results in high immunity towards moisture and oxygen, hitherto unreported. DSH facilitates the passivation of surface defects and etching of degraded Cs4PbI6 phase, thus reverting them back to the cubic CsPbI3 phase, leading to enhanced PL and environmental stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane Electrode Assembly for Electrocatalytic CO2&#160;Reduction: Principle and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems is a promising technology. Gaseous CO2 can be directly transported to the cathode catalyst layer, leading to enhanced reaction rate. Meanwhile, there is no liquid electrolyte between the cathode and the anode, which can help to improve the energy efficiency of the whole system. The remarkable progress achieved recently points out the way to realize industrially relevant performance. In this review, we focus on the principles in MEA for CO2RR, focusing on gas diffusion electrodes and ion exchange membranes. Furthermore, anode processes beyond the oxidation of water are considered. Besides, the voltage distribution is scrutinized to identify the specific losses related to the individual components. We also summarize the progress on the generation of different reduced products together with the corresponding catalysts. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are highlighted for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>High Dielectric Poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;Based Polymer Enables&#160;Uniform Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport in Solid&#8208;State Ionogel Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids (ILs)&#8208;incorporated solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (iono&#8208;SPEs) have high ionic conductivities but show non&#8208;uniform Li+ transport in different phases. This work greatly promotes Li+ transport in polymer phases by employing a poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CTFE), PTC] as the framework of ILs to prepare iono&#8208;SPEs. Unlike PVDF, PTC with suitable polarity shows weaker adsorption energy on IL cations, reducing their possibility of occupying Li+&#8208;hopping sites. The significantly higher dielectric constant of PTC than PVDF facilitates the dissociation of Li&#8208;anions clusters. These two factors motivate Li+ transport along PTC chains, narrowing the difference of Li+ transport among varied phases. The LiFePO4/PTC iono&#8208;SPE/Li cells cycle steadily with capacity retention of 91.5% after 1000 cycles at 1C and 25 oC. This work paves a new way to induce uniform Li+ flux in iono&#8208;SPEs through polarity and dielectric design of polymer matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;site conformational exchange in the synthetic neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch studied by 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch interacts with its cognate ligand neomycin as well as with the related antibiotics ribostamycin and paromomycin. Binding of these aminoglycosides induces a very similar ground state structures in the RNA, however, only neomycin can efficiently repress translation initiation. The molecular origin of these differences has been traced back to differences in the dynamics of the ligand:riboswitch complexes. Here, we combine five complementary fluorine based NMR methods to accurately quantify seconds to microseconds dynamics in the three riboswitch complexes. Our data reveal complex exchange processes with up to four structurally different states. We interpret our findings in a model that shows an interplay between different chemical groups in the antibiotics and specific bases in the riboswitch. More generally, our data underscore the potential of 19F NMR methods to characterize complex exchange processes with multiple excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Degraders of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B and T&#8208;Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) play non&#8208;redundant negative regulatory roles in T&#8208;cell activation, tumor antigen presentation, insulin and leptin signaling, and are potential targets for several therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a highly potent and selective small molecule degrader DU&#8208;14 for both PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP. DU&#8208;14 mediated PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation requires both target protein(s) and VHL E3 ligase engagement and is also ubiquitination&#8208; and proteasome&#8208;dependent. DU&#8208;14 enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; induced JAK1/2&#8208;STAT1 pathway activation and promotes MHC&#8208;I expression in tumor cells. DU&#8208;14 also activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells and augments STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, DU&#8208;14 induces PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation in vivo and suppresses MC38 syngeneic tumor growth. The results indicate that DU&#8208;14, as the first PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP dual degrader, merits further development for treating cancer and other indications.</dc:description>

         <title>Coronaviruses Use ACE2 Monomers as Entry&#8208;Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as entry receptor on cells enabling binding and infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) via trimeric spike (S) proteins protruding from the viral surface. It has been suggested that trimeric S proteins preferably bind to plasma membrane areas with high concentrations of possibly multimeric ACE2 receptors to achieve a higher binding and infection efficiency. Here we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) in combination with different labeling approaches to visualize the distribution and quantify the expression of ACE2 on different cells. Our results reveal that endogenous ACE2 receptors are present as monomers in the plasma membrane with densities of only 1&#8208;2 receptors &#181;m&#8208;2. In addition, binding of trimeric S proteins does not induce the formation of ACE2 oligomers in the plasma membrane. Supported by infection studies using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing S proteins our data demonstrate that a single S protein interaction per virus particle with a monomeric ACE2 receptor is sufficient for infection, which provides SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 a high infectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;N Coupling through Hydroaminoalkylation on a Single&#8208;Atom Rh Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly dispersed Rh1O4 sites anchored on the support of a heterogeneous catalyst are highly active and selective for hydroaminoalkylation at 110&#8201;&#176;C. Different from a Rh molecular catalyst, this Rh single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalyst can be readily separated from products and be reused in multiple runs with similar catalytic performance.







Abstract
C&#8722;N coupling is significant for the synthesis of fine chemicals toward various applications. Hydroaminoalkylation of olefins is a tandem reaction of C&#8722;N coupling involving first the formation of an aldehyde through hydroformylation of an olefin and then the production of amine through reductive amination of the aldehyde. Here we report a stable, supported catalyst of singly dispersed Rh1 atoms anchored on TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles designated as Rh1/P25. Its high activity for C&#8722;N coupling was demonstrated by six hydroaminoalkylations of olefins and amines with selectivity of higher than 90% for producing tertiary amines. The singly dispersed Rh1O4 on P25 exhibit activity and selectivity for hydroaminoalkylation comparable or even higher than some reported molecular catalysts. In contrast to molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8208;based single&#8208;atom Rh heterogeneous catalysis (Rh1/P25) can be readily separated from reactants and products, reused for multiple runs of hydroaminoalkylation, and recycled with a low cost.

         <title>Frustration in Super&#8208;Ionic Conductors Unraveled by the Density of Atomistic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of atomistic states (DOAS) quantitatively characterizes the onset and degree of disordering, reveals the energetics of local disorder, and elucidates how the frustration enhances diffusion, through the broadening and overlapping of the energy levels of atomistic states. The DOAS is generally applicable analytics for unraveling fundamental mechanisms in complex atomistic systems and for guiding material design.







Abstract
The frustration in super&#8208;ionic conductors enables their exceptionally high ionic conductivities, which are desired for many technological applications including batteries and fuel cells. A key challenge in the study of frustration is the difficulties in analyzing a large number of disordered atomistic configurations. Using lithium super&#8208;ionic conductors as model systems, we propose and demonstrate the density of atomistic states (DOAS) analytics to quantitatively characterize the onset and degree of disordering, reveal the energetics of local disorder, and elucidate how the frustration enhances diffusion through the broadening and overlapping of the energy levels of atomistic states. Furthermore, material design strategies aided by the DOAS are devised and demonstrated for new super&#8208;ionic conductors. The DOAS is generally applicable analytics for unraveling fundamental mechanisms in complex atomistic systems and guiding material design.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Switchable Selective Oxidations of Styrene Over Covalent Triazine Frameworks in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free covalent triazine frameworks were designed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. By deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99&#8201;% conversion and selectivity. Epoxidation of styrene with peroxymonocarbonate as an initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate produced styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76&#8201;% and near quantitative conversion.







Abstract
Using photocatalytic oxidation to convert basic chemicals into high value compounds in environmentally benign reaction media is a current focus in catalytic research. The challenge lies in gaining controllability over product formation selectivity. We design covalent triazine frameworks as heterogeneous, metal&#8208;free, and recyclable photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. Selectivity in product formation was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species. Using the same photocatalyst, by deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99&#8201;% conversion and over 99&#8201;% selectivity as a single product. The highly challenging and sensitive epoxidation of styrene was carried out by creating peroxymonocarbonate as an initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate, which led to formation of styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76&#8201;% with near quantitative conversion. This study demonstrates a preliminary yet interesting example for simple control over switchable product formation selectivity for challenging oxidation reactions of organic compounds in pure water.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Negative Hydrogen Production Strategy: CO2 Selective Capture with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure is reported. A universal photocatalysis reaction was adopted as driving force and carbonate&#8208;intercalated layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with electron storage/release function were employed as adsorption catalysts.







Abstract
We reported a strategy of carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure. For this purpose, carbonate&#8208;type CuxMgyFez layered double hydroxide (LDH) was preciously constructed, and then a photocatalysis reaction of interlayer CO32&#8722; reduction with glycerol oxidation was performed as driving force to induce the electron storage on LDH layers. With the participation of pre&#8208;stored electrons, CO2 was captured to recover interlayer CO32&#8722; in presence of H2O, accompanied with equivalent H2 production. During photocatalysis reaction, Cu0.6Mg1.4Fe1 exhibited a decent CO evolution amount of 1.63&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and dihydroxyacetone yield of 3.81&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In carbon&#8208;negative H2 production process, it showed an exciting CO2 capture quantity of 1.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and H2 yield of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Besides, this system possessed stable operation capability under simulated flu gas condition with negligible performance loss, exhibiting application prospect.

         <title>Easy Access to Diverse Multiblock Copolymers with On&#8208;Demand Blocks via Thioester&#8208;Relayed In&#8208;Chain Cascade Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization is developed for preparation of diverse multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures.







Abstract
Multiblock copolymers are envisioned as promising materials with enhanced properties and functionality compared with their diblock/triblock counterparts. However, the current approaches can construct multiblock copolymers with a limited number of blocks but tedious procedures. Here, we report a thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization strategy for the easy preparation of multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups with on&#8208;demand numbers are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides independently and concurrently to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures. The compositions, number of blocks, and block degree of polymerization can be easily regulated. This strategy can offer easy access to a library of multiblock copolymers with &#8776;100 blocks in only 2 to 4&#8197;steps.

         <title>Fabrication of Highly Oriented Ultrathin Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane from Nanosheets towards Unprecedented Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>

Highly oriented sub&#8208;200&#8208;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework membranes showed unprecedented CO2/N2 and H2/CO2 separation performances, respectively. Their formation was aided by the preparation of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet seeds via anisotropic etching, confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, and the use of a ZrS2 source during epitaxial growth.







Abstract
Concurrent regulation of crystallographic orientation and thickness of zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) membranes is challenging but promising for their performance enhancement. In this study, we pioneered the fabrication of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped, 40&#8197;nm thick UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet (NS) seeds by employing an anisotropic etching strategy. Through innovating confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 165&#8197;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 membrane was prepared. The significant reduction in thickness and diffusion barrier in the framework endowed the membrane with unprecedented CO2 permeance (2070 GPU) as well as high CO2/N2 selectivity (35.4), which surpassed the performance limits of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polycrystalline MOF membranes. In addition, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 180&#8197;nm&#8208;thick NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 membrane showing superb H2/CO2 separation performance with H2 permeance of 1230 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of 41.3, was prepared with the above synthetic procedure.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent regulation of crystallographic orientation and thickness of zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr-MOF) membranes is challenging but promising for their performance enhancement. In this study, we pioneered the fabrication of uniform triangular-shaped, 40&#8197;nm thick UiO-66 nanosheet (NS) seeds by employing an anisotropic etching strategy. Through innovating confined counter-diffusion-assisted epitaxial growth, highly (111)-oriented 165&#8197;nm-thick UiO-66 membrane was prepared. The significant reduction in thickness and diffusion barrier in the framework endowed the membrane with unprecedented CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance (2070 GPU) as well as high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (35.4), which surpassed the performance limits of state-of-the-art polycrystalline MOF membranes. In addition, highly (111)-oriented 180&#8197;nm-thick NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66 membrane showing superb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 1230 GPU and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 41.3, was prepared with the above synthetic procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Two&#8208;Color Coincidence Detection of Unlabeled alpha&#8208;Synuclein Aggregates</title>

         <dc:description>
Pathological protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders are difficult to characterise using current methods. We present a novel single&#8208;molecule detection method to specifically detect and characterise &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates at picomolar concentrations. We demonstrate the ability to detect aggregates in biologically relevant samples.







Abstract
Protein misfolding and aggregation into oligomeric and fibrillar structures is a common feature of many neurogenerative disorders. Single&#8208;molecule techniques have enabled characterization of these lowly abundant, highly heterogeneous protein aggregates, previously inaccessible using ensemble averaging techniques. However, they usually rely on the use of recombinantly&#8208;expressed labeled protein, or on the addition of amyloid stains that are not protein&#8208;specific. To circumvent these challenges, we have made use of a high affinity antibody labeled with orthogonal fluorophores combined with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics and single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy to specifically detect &#945;&#8208;synuclein, the protein associated with Parkinson's disease. We used this approach to determine the number and size of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates down to picomolar concentrations in biologically relevant samples.

         <title>ECNU&#8208;13: A High&#8208;Silica Zeolite with Three&#8208;Dimensional and High&#8208;Connectivity Multi&#8208;Pore Structures for Selective Alkene Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;silica zeolite skeleton, ECNU&#8208;13, was designed and synthesized by a phase&#8208;discrimination strategy. The crystallization process was directed by the regulation of single four&#8208;membered ring (s4r) units to give rise to two kinds of polymorphs with 3&#8208;dimensional high&#8208;connectivity multi&#8208;pore systems. The ECNU&#8208;13 zeolite demonstrated high propene selectivity in cracking of 1&#8208;butene, with minimized formation of aromatics.







Abstract
A high&#8208;silica zeolite ECNU&#8208;13 (Si/Al=23) with a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pore system and a nanosized morphology has been developed, consisting of multitudes of 10&#8208;membered ring (10&#8208;R) medium pores and one set of 8&#8208;R small pores. A phase&#8208;discrimination strategy was proposed to synthesize ECNU&#8208;13 by regulating the gel compositions and nucleation processes that were used for preparing 12&#8208;R large&#8208;pore germanosilicate IM&#8208;20 with the known UWY topology. The crystallization was directed towards forming one set of single four&#8208;ring (s4r) composite building units together with one set of double four&#8208;ring (d4r) rather than two different types of d4r units in IM&#8208;20. The electron crystallographic investigations elucidated that the ECNU&#8208;13 structure was composed of two kinds of polymorphs as a result of distinct atomic positionings in s4r units. In catalytic cracking of 1&#8208;butene, ECNU&#8208;13 exhibited high propene selectivity (55.6&#8201;%) and propene to ethylene molar ratio (&gt;4.7) superior to well&#8208;studied conventional ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast One&#8208;Handed Helix Induction and Its Static Helicity Memory in a Poly(biphenylylacetylene) with a Catalytic Amount of Chiral Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and subsequent static helicity memory in a poly(biphenylylacetylene) were achieved using a catalytic amount of nonracemic ammonium salts with non&#8208;coordinating tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate as a counter anion. Helix induction relies on crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like specific intermolecular complex formation of the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants with chiral ammonium in specific aromatic solvents.







Abstract
We report an ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and subsequent static helicity memory in poly(biphenylylacetylene) (PBPA&#8208;A) assisted by a catalytic amount of nonracemic ammonium salts comprised of non&#8208;coordinating tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (BArF&#8722;) as a counter anion. The remarkable acceleration of the helix&#8208;induction rate in PBPA&#8208;A accompanied by the significant amplification of the asymmetry relies on the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants, which can gain access to enfold the chiral ammoniums in a crown&#8208;ether manner in specific aromatic solvents, leading to ultra&#8208;fast helicity induction, which is completed within 30&#8197;s. In aromatic solvents, helicity memory is lost rapidly, but is quite stable in long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. The best use of specific solvents for helicity induction and static helicity memory, respectively, provides a highly sensitive chirality sensing system toward a small amount of chiral amines and amino acids when complexed with BArF&#8722;.

Co&#8208;crystallization of an end&#8208;functionalized polymer and nanoparticles (NPs) leads to the formation of hollow spherical assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization, the translational symmetry is broken in NPCs. This strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translation symmetry.







Abstract
Nanoparticle (NP) assembly has been extensively studied, and a library of NP superstructures has been synthesized. These intricate structures show unique collective optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. In this work, we report a bottom&#8208;up approach for fabricating spherical gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assemblies that mimic colloidosomes. Co&#8208;crystallization of lipoic acid&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and AuNPs in solution via a self&#8208;seeding method led to the formation of hollow spherical NP assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the spherical shape, the translational symmetry of PEO crystals is broken in NPCs, which can be attributed to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization. This was confirmed by tuning the NPC morphology via varying the self&#8208;seeding temperature, crystallization temperature, and PEO molecular weight. We envisage that this strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translational symmetry.

         <title>Activating Bi p&#8208;orbitals in Dispersed Clusters of Amorphous BiOx for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining first&#8208;principles calculations and in situ electrochemical conversion experiments, we propose a novel and effective approach to modify the 6p&#8208;orbitals of bismuth by exploiting the properties of atomically dispersed amorphous clusters. In contrast to transition metals, Bi exhibits superior p&#8208;orbital based catalytic activity and selectivity for nitrogen fixation by transferring electrons from the half&#8208;occupied pz into the inert N2 orbital.







Abstract
Catalytic strategies based on main group metals are significantly less advanced than those of transition metal catalysis, leaving untapped areas of potentially fruitful research. We here demonstrate an effective approach for the modulation of Bi 6p energy levels during the construction of atomically dispersed clusters of amorphous BiOx. Bi oxidation state is proposed to strongly affects the nitrogen fixation activity, with the half&#8208;occupied pz orbitals of the Bi2+ ions being highly efficient toward electron injection into the inert N2 molecule. With sufficient catalytic sites to adsorb and activate N2, the bonding between N2 and catalyst is able to be in situ identified. The catalyst shows an outstanding Faraday efficiency (&#8776;30&#8201;%) and high yield (&#8776;113&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat) in NH3 production, outperforming most of the existing catalysts in aqueous solution. These results lay the basis for developing the potential of p&#8208;block elements for catalysis of multi&#8208;electron reactions.

         <title>Efficient Reverse Intersystem Crossing in Carbene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide TADF Emitters via an Intermediate Triplet State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism underlying reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) dynamics in a carbene&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;carbazolyl TADF emitter is unravelled. Efficient rISC on a picosecond timescale occurs on a geometry of perpendicular ligand orientation mediated by a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state. This process is followed by a return to a co&#8208;planar ligand orientation with a high fluorescence rate.







Abstract
The mechanism behind reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) in metal&#8208;based TADF emitters is still under debate. Thermal rISC necessitates small singlet/triplet energy gaps as realized in donor&#8208;acceptor systems with charge&#8208;transfer excited states. However, their associated spin&#8208;orbit couplings are too small to account for effective rISC. Here, we report the first nonadiabatic dynamics simulation of the rISC process in a carbene&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;carbazolyl TADF emitter. Efficient rISC on a picosecond time scale is demonstrated for an initial triplet minimum geometry that exhibits a perpendicular orientation of the ligands. The dynamics involves an intermediate higher&#8208;lying triplet state of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character (3MLCT), which enables large spin&#8208;orbit couplings with the lowest singlet charge transfer state. The mechanism is completed in the S1 state, where the complex can return to a co&#8208;planar coordination geometry that presents high fluorescence efficiency.

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Stable Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes with Barium [2.2.2]Cryptate Cations: The Importance of High Binding Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex of [2.2.2]cryptand and Ba2+ is used as a novel cationic functional group for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membrane applications. The complex synergistically has high binding constant, excellent alkaline stability, and a stable main&#8208;group&#8208;metal center.







Abstract
The stability of cationic functional groups is one of the key factors determining lifetime of alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AAEMs) and the AAEM&#8208;based electrochemical devices. Main&#8208;group metal and crown ether complexes are stable cations due to the absence of degradation pathways including nucleophilic substitution, Hofmann elimination, and cation redox. However, the binding strength, a key feature for AAEM applications, is overlooked in previous work. We herein propose the use of barium [2.2.2]cryptate ([Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+) as a new cationic functional group for AAEMs due to its extremely strong binding (109.5&#8197;M&#8722;1 in water at 25&#8201;&#176;C). The [Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+&#8208;AAEMs with polyolefin backbones remain stable after treatment in 15&#8197;M KOH at 60&#8201;&#176;C for over 1500&#8197;hours. More importantly, these AAEMs are successfully applied in water electrolyzers, and an anolyte&#8208;feeding switch method is designed to further reveal the influence of binding constants.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric Bi0.6Sb0.4Te: Elimination of Detrimental Band Inversion in BiTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual synergistic effect of Sb doping in BiTe is reported that eliminates the detrimental band inversion by weakening the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, thus leading to a rare overlap of conduction band and valence band that significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient. In addition, this effect enhances the carrier mobility owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A direction in the first Brillouin zone.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric materials are the key to miniaturizing refrigeration equipment and have great scientific and social implications, yet their application is hindered by their extreme scarcity. BiTe exhibiting strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling peaks ZT at 600&#8197;K. Herein, we discover the synergy effect of Sb doping in BiTe that eliminates the detrimental band inversion and leads to an overlap of conduction band (CB) and valence band that significantly increases the S from 33 to 124&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;K&#8722;1. In addition, this effect enhances the &#956; from 58 to 92&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A in the first Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Sb doping increases the anharmonicity, shortens the phonon lifetime and lowers &#954;lat. Finally, Se/Sb codoping further optimizes the ZT to 0.6 at 300&#8197;K, suggesting that Bi0.6Sb0.4Te1&#8722;ySey is a potential room&#8208;temperature TE material.

         <title>Highly Selective Photoelectroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethanol over Graphene/Silicon Carbide Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial layer in the graphene/silicon carbide composite allows the facile transfer of photogenerated electrons from the silicon carbide substrate to the active sites of graphene, resulting in efficient CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling for ethanol production. This catalyst showed a near&#8208;perfect ethanol selectivity of&gt;99&#8201;% at an exceedingly high CO2 conversion rate of 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and stability in ambient CO2 photoelectroreduction.







Abstract
Using sunlight to produce valuable chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide (CO2), i.e., artificial photosynthesis (AP) is a promising strategy to achieve solar energy storage and a negative carbon cycle. However, selective synthesis of C2 compounds with a high CO2 conversion rate remains challenging for current AP technologies. We performed CO2 photoelectroreduction over a graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) catalyst under simulated solar irradiation with ethanol (C2H5OH) selectivity of&gt;99&#8201;% and a CO2 conversion rate of up to 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with sustained performance. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicated an optimal interfacial layer to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the SiC substrate to the few&#8208;layer graphene overlayer, which also favored an efficient CO2 to C2H5OH conversion pathway.

&lt;p&gt;The interfacial layer in the graphene/silicon carbide composite allows the facile transfer of photogenerated electrons from the silicon carbide substrate to the active sites of graphene, resulting in efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and C&#8722;C coupling for ethanol production. This catalyst showed a near-perfect ethanol selectivity of&amp;gt;99&#8201;% at an exceedingly high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate of 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and stability in ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectroreduction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using sunlight to produce valuable chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), i.e., artificial photosynthesis (AP) is a promising strategy to achieve solar energy storage and a negative carbon cycle. However, selective synthesis of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds with a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate remains challenging for current AP technologies. We performed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectroreduction over a graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) catalyst under simulated solar irradiation with ethanol (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) selectivity of&amp;gt;99&#8201;% and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate of up to 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with sustained performance. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicated an optimal interfacial layer to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the SiC substrate to the few-layer graphene overlayer, which also favored an efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH conversion pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Compartmentalized Nanoreactor Formed by Interfacial Hydrogelation for Cascade Enzyme Catalytic Therapy</title>

The compartmented Burr&#8208;NCs@GlSOD nanoreactor was constructed by a self&#8208;confined catalysis strategy. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase&#8208;like superactivity induced hydrogelation and core&#8211;shell cascade laccase&#8208;SOD and SOD&#8208;Fenton catalytic therapy were explored. The work introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and specificity to natural enzymes.







Abstract
Some cellular enzymatic pathways are located within a single organelle, while most others involve enzymes that are located within multiple compartmentalized cellular organelles to realize the efficient multi&#8208;step enzymatic process. Herein, bioinspired by enzyme&#8208;mediated biosynthesis and biochemical defense, a compartmented nanoreactor (Burr&#8208;NCs@GlSOD) was constructed through a self&#8208;confined catalysis strategy with burr defect&#8208;engineered molybdenum disulfide/Prussian blue analogues (MoS2/PBA) and an interfacial diffusion&#8208;controlled hydrogel network. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase&#8208;like superactivity induced hydrogelation and cascade enzyme catalytic therapy were explored. The confined hydrogelation strategy introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and provides insight into biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and also the specificity to natural enzymes.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H/O2 Dual Activation and Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole Grafted Macrocyclic Inhibitors for Influenza H1N1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here is an unprecedented and practical RhIII&#8208;catalyzed acylmethylation macrocyclization via C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The reaction mode derives from a three&#8208;component coupling which differs from established olefination and alkylation paths. DFT calculations and control experiments revealed the mechanism of this unique C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The phenotypic screening result indicated that some macrocyclic products have a potent anti&#8208;H1N1 bioactivity.







Abstract
The development of environment&#8208;friendly, step economic couplings to generate structurally diverse macrocyclic compounds is highly desirable but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by the C&#8722;H oxidation mechanism of cytochromes&#8197;P450, an unprecedented and practical RhIII&#8208;catalyzed acylmethylation macrocyclization via C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation has been developed by us. The process of macrocyclization is facilitated by a synergic coordination from pyridine and ester group. Interestingly, the reaction mode derives from a three&#8208;component coupling which differs from established olefination and alkylation paths. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments revealed the mechanism of this unique C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The newly achieved acylmethylation macrocyclic products and their derivatives showed a potent anti&#8208;H1N1 bioactivity, which may provide an opportunity for the discovery of novel anti&#8208;H1N1 macrocyclic leading compounds.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mediated Spinel Octahedral Structures for Elevated Performances of Li&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;atomic metals could render highly active Co3+ centers exposed through the electron promoter effect and also separate the active sites, thereby regulating the morphology of Li2O2 to elevated performances of Li&#8208;oxygen battery. We found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Li&#8208;oxygen batteries have attracted much attention due to its ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity, but the discharge product Li2O2 is easy to accumulate, leading to low battery stability. Here, we demonstrate a series of high&#8208;efficiency cathode catalysts of Co3O4 loaded with single&#8208;atomic metals (M=Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ir). The single&#8208;atomic metal could substitute the central Co atom in the octahedral coordination structure and maintain the structural stability; benefiting from the electron promoter effect, rendering more highly active Co3+ exposed, providing rich nucleation sites for Li2O2 deposition. And the loaded M atoms could separate the active Co3+ centers, thereby regulating the dispersion of Li2O2 to obtained a sheet&#8208;like morphology, which could facilitate its decomposition in the subsequent charge cycle. Our work found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.

A unified strategy for the synthesis of Kopsia monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is described. Key transformations developed are an intramolecular Pummerer rearrangement induced nucleophilic cyclization/aza&#8208;Prins cyclization to construct the highly functional hexahydrocarbazole skeleton, an iridium complex mediated radical addition to fuse the aspidofractine framework, and an IBX oxidation to introduce the &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone moiety.







Abstract
Kopsia alkaloids represent a complex class of natural products bearing a polycyclic ring system with two or three consecutive quaternary carbon centers. In this article, we report the first total synthesis of Kopsaporine related alkaloids. Features of our structure&#8208;unit&#8208;based strategy are an intramolecular Pummerer rearrangement induced nucleophilic cyclization/aza&#8208;Prins cyclization to construct the highly functional hexahydrocarbazole skeleton, an olefin migration vinylogous alkylation to establish the C20 all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, an iridium complex mediated radical addition to fuse the aspidofractine framework, an unprecedented IBX oxidation to introduce the &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone moiety, and a bioinspired retro&#8208;Aldol/Aldol reaction to convert kopsaporine to kopsiloscine&#8197;A.

         <title>Identification of Active Sites Formed on Cobalt Oxyhydroxide in Glucose Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides are well&#8208;known catalysts for biomass electrooxidation to produce valuable chemicals. However, identification of active site remains elusive, owing to the structural complexity under reaction conditions. In this work, a suite of operando spectroscopies and theoretical calculations were combined, unveiling two types of reducible Co3+&#8208;oxo species as the active sites in cobalt oxyhydroxide for glucose electrooxidation.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based oxyhydroxides are efficient catalysts in biomass electrooxidation towards fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;free production of valuable chemicals. However, identification of active sites remains elusive. Herein, using cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as the archetype and the electrocatalyzed glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) as the model reaction, we track dynamic transformation of the electronic and atomic structure of the catalyst using a suite of operando and ex situ techniques. We reveal that two types of reducible Co3+&#8208;oxo species are afforded for the GOR, including adsorbed hydroxyl on Co3+ ion (&#956;1&#8208;OH&#8722;Co3+) and di&#8208;Co3+&#8208;bridged lattice oxygen (&#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;Co3+). Moreover, theoretical calculations unveil that &#956;1&#8208;OH&#8722;Co3+ is responsible for oxygenation, while &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;Co3+ mainly contributes to dehydrogenation, both as key oxidative steps in glucose&#8208;to&#8208;formate transformation. This work provides a framework for mechanistic understanding of the complex near&#8208;surface chemistry of metal oxyhydroxides in biomass electrorefining.

         <title>Synergistic Fe&#8722;Se Atom Pairs as Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts Boost Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional Fe&#8722;Se atom pair electrocatalyst shows a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance, and the Fe&#8722;Se/NC based cable&#8208;structure Zn&#8208;air batteries deliver an ultra&#8208;high cycling performance of 741&#8197;h @1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a negligible activity delay at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic interactions of Fe and Se sites.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully construct bifunctional electrocatalysts by synthesizing atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs supported on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;Se/NC). The obtained Fe&#8722;Se/NC shows a noteworthy bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance with a low potential difference of 0.698&#8197;V, far superior to that of reported Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts. The theoretical calculations reveal that p&#8208;d orbital hybridization around the Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs leads to remarkably asymmetrical polarized charge distributions. Fe&#8722;Se/NC based solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC) present stable charge/discharge of 200&#8197;h (1090&#8197;cycles) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is 6.9&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. At extremely low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC displays an ultra&#8208;robust cycling performance of 741&#8197;h (4041&#8197;cycles) at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is about 11.7&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. More importantly, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC could be operated for 133&#8197;h (725&#8197;cycles) even at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Stable Ketenyl Anions via Ligand Exchange at an Anionic Carbon as Powerful Synthons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide, a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt (1) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving a (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt (2). Reactivity investigations showed that the ketenyl anion can be a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.







Abstract
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO), a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CN2][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)(THF)] (1) ([P]=[(CH2)(NDipp)]2P; 18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving the (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (2). Oxidation of 2 with elemental Se affords the (selenophosphoryl)ketenyl anion salt [P](Se)&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (3). These ketenyl anions feature a strongly bent geometry at the P&#8208;bound carbon and this carbon atom is highly nucleophilic. The electronic structure of the ketenyl anion [[P]&#8208;CCO]&#8722; of 2 is examined by theoretical studies. Reactivity investigations demonstrate 2 as a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.

         <title>Annealing in Argon Universally Upgrades the Na&#8208;Storage Performance of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathodes by Creating Bulk Oxygen Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach of annealing in argon atmosphere rather than conventional air is for the first time, demonstrated to comprehensively upgrade the Na&#8208;storage performance (including specific capacity, operating voltage, and cycling durability) of Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes by creating bulk oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are extremely promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their high capacities and cost effectiveness, while the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion and low operating potential of Mn redox largely hinder their practical applications. Herein, we reveal that annealing in argon rather than conventional air is a universal strategy to comprehensively upgrade the Na&#8208;storage performance of Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes. Bulk oxygen vacancies are introduced via this method, leading to reduced Mn valence, lowered Mn 3d&#8208;orbital energy level, and formation of the new&#8208;concept Mn domains. As a result, the energy density of the model P2&#8208;Na0.75Mg0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode increases by &#8776;50&#8201;% benefiting from the improved specific capacity and operating potential of Mn redox. The Mn domains can disrupt the cooperative J&#8211;T distortion, greatly promoting the cycling stability. This exciting finding opens a new avenue towards high&#8208;performance Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes for SIBs.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling for the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides under mild conditions is reported. The enantioselective alkenylation/arylation of racemic secondary phosphine oxides with alkenyl/aryl bromides provided P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides with high enantioselectivities of up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A general and mild nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides has been developed. The asymmetric alkenylation/arylation of racemic secondary phosphine oxides with alkenyl/aryl bromides generated P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides with high yields and enantioselectivities. Various functional groups were tolerated, and the applications of this method were demonstrated through late&#8208;stage functionalization and product transformations.

         <title>Recycling Valuable Metals from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Carbothermal Shock Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbothermal shock (CTS) method with high heating and cooling rates, high temperatures (up to &#8776;2200&#8201;&#176;C), and ultrafast reaction times of &#8776;20&#8197;s is utilized for recycling spent cathode materials. Li can be selectively leached through water leaching with an efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;%. Ni, Co, and Mn are recovered by dilute acid leaching with efficiencies &gt;98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Pyrometallurgy technique is usually applied as a pretreatment to enhance the leaching efficiencies in the hydrometallurgy process for recovering valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, traditional pyrometallurgy processes are energy and time consuming. Here, we report a carbothermal shock (CTS) method for reducing LiNi0.3Co0.2Mn0.5O2 (NCM325) cathode materials with uniform temperature distribution, high heating and cooling rates, high temperatures, and ultrafast reaction times. Li can be selectively leached through water leaching after CTS process with an efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;%. Ni, Co, and Mn are recovered by dilute acid leaching with efficiencies &gt;98&#8201;%. The CTS reduction strategy is feasible for various spent cathode materials, including NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, NCM811, LiCoO2, and LiMn2O4. The CTS process, with its low energy consumption and potential scale application, provides an efficient and environmentally friendly way for recovering spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Showing 0D to 1D Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Structural Transition and Hysteresis Modulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A reversible photo&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal structural transformation was achieved for a mononuclear dysprosium&#8208;anthracene compound to form a 1D coordination polymer. This compound displays photoswitchable SMM properties with reduced effective spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier, narrowed butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop, and decreased blocking temperature.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM) hold great promise for future switching and memory devices. Herein, we report a dysprosium phosphonate [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma)2(4&#8208;hpy)2] (1Dy), which features a supramolecular framework containing layers of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and pillars of &#960;&#8211;&#960; interacted anthracene units. The photocycloaddition reaction of anthracene pairs led to a rapid and reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8211;SC) structural transition to form the 1D coordination polymer [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma2)(4&#8208;hpy)2]n (2Dy), accompanied by photoswitchable SMM properties with the reduction of effective energy barrier by half and the narrowing of the butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop. The diluted sample showed a photo&#8208;induced switch of the blocking temperature (TB) from 3.8&#8197;K for 1Dy@Y to 2.6&#8197;K for 2Dy@Y. This work may inspire the construction of lanthanide&#8208;based molecular materials with targeted photo&#8208;responsive magnetic properties.

         <title>Studying Regioisomer Formation in the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorination of Cyclic Vinyl Triflates: Evidence for in situ Ligand Modification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study was conducted to investigate the regioisomer formation in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates. Results suggested that the TESCF3 additive unlocked an alternative reaction pathway involving a usual in situ ligand dearomatization. This new mechanism prevented the formation of Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne intermediates and significantly increased the regioselectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic fluorination reactions are important methods for the synthesis of fluoroarenes and fluoroalkenes. However, these reactions can generate a mixture of regioisomeric products that are often difficult to separate. While investigating the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates, we observed that the addition of a substoichiometric quantity of TESCF3 significantly improved the regioselectivity of the reaction. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational study on the mechanism of this transformation focusing on the role of TESCF3. The poor regioselectivity of the reaction in the absence of additives results from the formation of LPd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes (L=biaryl monophosphine ligand). When TESCF3 is added to the reaction mixture, the generation of the Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes is diminished by an unexpected pathway involving the dearomatization of the ligand by nucleophilic attack from a trifluoromethyl anion (CF3&#8722;).

         <title>Tuning Local Coordination Environments of Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Properties for Selective Colorimetric Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for achieving the multi&#8208;enzymatic performance of SAzymes through regulating the coordination number of heterogeneous manganese single&#8208;atom catalysts (MnSA&#8722;Nx&#8722;C) is designed and implemented. A series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzyme is successfully built for the specific recognition of biological molecules.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are promising in next&#8208;generation nanozymes, nevertheless, how to rationally modulate the microenvironment of SAzymes with controllable multi&#8208;enzyme properties is still challenging. Herein, we systematically investigate the relationship between atomic configuration and multi&#8208;enzymatic performances. The constructed MnSA&#8722;N3&#8208;coordinated SAzymes (MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C) exhibits much more remarkable oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and glutathione oxidase&#8208;like activities than that of MnSA&#8722;N4&#8722;C. Based on experimental and theoretical results, these multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like behaviors are highly dependent on the coordination number of single atomic Mn sites by local charge polarization. As a consequence, a series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzymes is successfully built for specific recognition of biological molecules. These findings provide atomic&#8208;level insight into the microenvironment of nanozymes, promoting rational design of other demanding biocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are promising in next-generation nanozymes, nevertheless, how to rationally modulate the microenvironment of SAzymes with controllable multi-enzyme properties is still challenging. Herein, we systematically investigate the relationship between atomic configuration and multi-enzymatic performances. The constructed Mn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-coordinated SAzymes (Mn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C) exhibits much more remarkable oxidase-, peroxidase-, and glutathione oxidase-like activities than that of Mn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C. Based on experimental and theoretical results, these multi-enzyme-like behaviors are highly dependent on the coordination number of single atomic Mn sites by local charge polarization. As a consequence, a series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on Mn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C SAzymes is successfully built for specific recognition of biological molecules.

         <title>Enhancement of Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution Activity of 2D &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bipyridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Protonation</title>

         <dc:description>
The introduction of bipyridine motifs in the 2D conjugated covalent organic framework, 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF, creates dedicated photoactive sites. Through a simple post&#8208;protonation strategy, the photo&#8208;generated electron&#8211;hole separation of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF was significantly enhanced and a hydrophilic pore channel was generated, which synergically lead to a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution represents a promising and sustainable technology. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based photocatalysts have received growing attention. A 2D fully conjugated ethylene&#8208;linked COF (BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF) was fabricated with a dedicated designed active site. The introduced bipyridine sites enable a facile post&#8208;protonation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the actives sites, which results in a largely improved charge&#8208;separation efficiency and increased hydrophilicity in the pore channels synergically. After modulating the degree of protonation, the optimal BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;PCOF exhibits a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 15.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, which surpasses the biphenyl&#8208;based COF 6 times. By using different types of acids, the post&#8208;protonation is proved to be a potential universal strategy for promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution. This strategy would provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.

         <title>&#8220;Pore&#8208;Hopping&#8221; Ion Transport in Cellulose&#8208;Based Separator Towards High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immersion curing of a cellulose&#8208;based separator (CP) with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) results in a cellulose&#8208;based composite separator (CP@PPC) for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; ion transport mechanism in CP@PPC allows a high Na+ transference number. PPC enhances the mechanical properties of the separator and the battery thermal safety, further promotes ion transport and improves the overall performance of the battery.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Cellulose is an attractive material for sustainable separators, but some key issues still exist affecting its application. Herein, a cellulose&#8208;based composite separator (CP@PPC) was prepared by immersion curing of cellulose&#8208;based separators (CP) with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, the CP@PPC separator is able to operate the cell stably at high voltages (up to 4.95&#8197;V). The &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; ion transport mechanism in CP@PPC opens up extra Na+ migration paths, resulting in a high Na+ transference number (0.613). The separator can also tolerate folding, bending and extreme temperature under certain circumstances. Full cells with CP@PPC reveal one&#8208;up capacity retention (96.97&#8201;%) at 2C after 500 cycles compared to cells with CP. The mechanism highlights the merits of electrolyte analogs in separator modification, making a rational design for durable devices in advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF&#8208;67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To prepare zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes, an ultrathin hydroxy salt precursor layer with high reactivity was constructed in situ. Its excellent induction effect allowed the formation of a continuous and ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 membrane on various surfaces at room temperature. Due to its pore size and preferential adsorption of polar molecules, the membrane gave excellent separation of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.







Abstract
Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF&#8208;67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF&#8208;67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF&#8208;67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176&#177;12&#8197;nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF&#8208;67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.

         <title>Tuning Hole Transport Properties via Pyrrole Derivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost hole transport materials T3, featuring a substituted pyrrole core and triphenylamine peripheral arms, have been designed and synthesized for high performance perovskite solar cells. The capability of functionalization in the final synthetic step provides an efficient way to tune energy levels and other properties of T3 materials.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) with high hole mobility, good band alignment and ease of fabrication are highly desirable for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized novel organic HTMs, named T3, which can be synthesized in high yields with commercially available materials, featuring a substituted pyrrole core and triphenylamine peripheral arms. The capability of functionalization in the final synthetic step provides an efficient way to obtain a variety of T3&#8208;based HTMs with tunable energy levels and other properties. Among them, fluorine&#8208;substituted T3 (T3&#8208;F) exhibits the best band alignment and hole extraction properties, leading to PSCs with outstanding PCEs of 24.85&#8201;% and 24.03&#8201;% (certified 23.46&#8201;%) for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1&#8197;cm2, respectively. The simple structure and tunable performance of T3 can inspire further optimization for efficient PSCs.

         <title>Heterostructures with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Long&#8208;lasting Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy strategy for achieving sustained efficient tumor treatment was developed by synthesizing Janus&#8208;like Fe@Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O heterostructures with built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs). Driven by the BIEFs, electrons in the Fe0 core were continuously transferred to the surface to reduce &#8801;Cu2+ to &#8801;Cu+, thus ensuring a sustained Fenton&#8208;like reaction and &#8901;OH production and forcing tumor cells to undergo apoptosis through ERK signal activation.







Abstract
Sustained signal activation by hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) has great significance, especially for tumor treatment, but remains challenging. Here, a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF)&#8208;driven strategy was proposed for sustainable generation of &#8901;OH, thereby achieving long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy (LCDT). As a proof of concept, a novel Janus&#8208;like Fe@Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O heterogeneous catalyst was designed and synthesized, in which the BIEF induced the transfer of electrons in the Fe core to the surface, reducing &#8801;Cu2+ to &#8801;Cu+, thus achieving continuous Fenton&#8208;like reactions and &#8901;OH release for over 18&#8197;h, which is approximately 12 times longer than that of Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O and 72 times longer than that of Cu2O nanoparticles. In vitro and in vivo antitumor results indicated that sustained &#8901;OH levels led to persistent extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signal activation and irreparable oxidative damage to tumor cells, which promoted irreversible tumor apoptosis. Importantly, this strategy provides ideas for developing long&#8208;acting nanoplatforms for various applications.

         <title>Regioisomeric Benzidine&#8208;Fullerenes: Tuning of the Diverse Hole&#8208;Distribution to Influence Charge Separation Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three regioisomeric benzidine&#8208;fullerenes have been synthesized. Following charge separation (CS), the para&#8208;isomer manifests hole&#8208;delocalization, promoting ultrafast CS; while meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;isomers cause hole&#8208;localization, contributing to long&#8208;lived CS state. This work reveals the influence of regioisomerism on charge distribution and CS.







Abstract
Understanding the influence of molecular structure on charge distribution and charge separation (CS) provides essential guidance for optoelectronic materials design. Here we propose a regioisomeric strategy to tune the diverse hole&#8208;distribution, and probe the influence on CS patterns. Para&#8208;, meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;substituted benzidine&#8208;fullerene, named 1&#8201;p, 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o are designed. Following CS, hole&#8208;delocalization occurs in 1&#8201;p, while hole&#8208;localization exists in 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o. The rates of charge separation (4.02&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) and recombination (9.8&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1) of 1&#8201;p is about 20 and 12&#8197;times faster than 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o, indicating that para&#8208;determined delocalization promotes ultrafast CS, while meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;generated localization contributes to long&#8208;lived CS states. Computational analysis further implies that localization results from the destruction of electronic conjugation for 1&#8201;m, and limitation of conformational relaxation for 1&#8201;o. Given that the universality and simplicity of regional isomerism, this work opens up new thoughts for molecular design with tunable charge separation patterns.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;Bisindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles has been established via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition of indole&#8208;based enaminones with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters. This study provides a new strategy for the highly selective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles and shows the successful application of such skeletons in medicinal and synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
This study establishes the first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloadditions of indole&#8208;based enaminones as novel platform molecules with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, where de novo indole&#8208;ring formation is involved. Using this new strategy, various axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles were synthesized in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 87&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee). More importantly, this class of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles exhibited some degree of cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and was derived into axially chiral phosphine ligands with high catalytic activity. This study provides a new strategy for enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles using asymmetric organocatalysis and is the first to realize the applications of such scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>A Hydrolyzable Supra&#8208;amphiphile as a Marangoni Self&#8208;Propulsion Fuel for Efficient Macroscopic Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible Schiff base has been used as the basis for a fuel for continuous Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion. Excessive interfacial aggregation of the amphiphilic molecules is avoided by timely hydrolyzation to surface&#8208;inactive species, which prolongs the motion lifetime by over 10&#8197;times. The fuel can efficiently propel &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components for the energy&#8208;dissipative self&#8208;assembly of precisely aligned structures.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components is important for achieving all&#8208;scale ordering with requirements of extra energy for motion and interaction of components. Marangoni flows caused by surfactants on water provide appropriate energy but have limited lifetimes because of the inevitable interfacial aggregation and difficult decomposition of aggregated covalent surfactants that inactivate Marangoni effects. Here we have synthesized a supra&#8208;amphiphile Marangoni &#8220;fuel&#8221;&#8212;sodium&#8208;4&#8208;(benzylideneamino) benzenesulfonate (SBBS)&#8212;that can be hydrolyzed in a timely manner to a species without surface activity to extend the motion time by 10&#8208;fold. The motion was optimized at pH=2 by a fine equilibrium between the releasing and removal of interfacial SBBS, leading to the self&#8208;assembly of millimeter&#8208;scaled ordered dimers. The underlying mechanism was interpreted by motion analyses and simulation. This strategy provides an active solution to self&#8208;assembly at the &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm scale, as well as interactive ideas between miniaturized chemical robots.

         <title>Amorphous NiFe Oxide&#8208;based Nanoreactors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous NiFe oxide&#8208;based nanoreactors were synthesized and applied as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The nanoreactor structure changes the catalyst&#8242;s spatial curvature and mass transfer, enriching OH&#8722; on the catalyst surface and inside the channels, so that a high current density is obtained. In addition, the combination of amorphousness and nanoreactors synergistically promotes oxygen evolution, achieving the effect of &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221;.







Abstract
Synergy engineering is an important way to enhance the kinetic activity of oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, we fabricated NiFe amorphous nanoreactor (NiFe&#8208;ANR) oxide as OER electrocatalysts via a mild self&#8208;catalytic reaction. Firstly, the amorphousness helps transform NiFe&#8208;ANR into highly active hydroxyhydroxides, and its many fine&#8208;grain boundaries increase active sites. More importantly, as proved by experiments and finite element analysis, the nanoreactor structure alters the spatial curvature and the mass transfer over the catalyst, thereby enriching OH&#8722; in the catalyst surface and inner part. Thus, the catalyst with the structure of amorphous nanoreactors gained excellent activity, far superior to the NiFe catalyst with the structure of crystalline nanoreactor or amorphous non&#8208;nanoreactor. This work provides new insights into the applications and mechanisms of amorphousness and nanoreactors, embodying the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergy of crystalline state and morphology.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Probe for Nuclear ATP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small&#8208;molecule probe for nuclear ATP is reported. The probe, a ZnII complex of a push&#8208;full type benzocoumarin dye bearing a dipicolylamine ligand, reversibly binds to nuclear ATP with a turn&#8208;on fluorescence response. Using the probe, we observed markedly higher levels of nuclear ATP in organ tissues of a tumor&#8208;xenografted mouse by two&#8208;photon microscopy, which is ascribed to aggressive cell progression in the mitosis phase.







Abstract
Fluorescence monitoring of ATP in different organelles is now feasible with a few biosensors developed, which, however, show low sensitivity, limited biocompatibility, and accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule ATP probes that alleviate those limitations thus have received much attention recently, leading to a few ATP probes that target several organelles except for the nucleus. We disclose the first small&#8208;molecule probe that selectively detects nuclear ATP through reversible binding, with 25&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH&#8197;7.4 and excellent selectivity against various biologically relevant species. Using the probe, we observed 2.1&#8211;3.3&#8208;fold and 3.9&#8211;7.8&#8208;fold higher nuclear ATP levels in cancerous cell lines and tumor tissues compared with normal cell lines and tissues, respectively, which are explained by the higher nuclear ATP level in the mitosis phase. The probe has great potential for studying nuclear ATP&#8208;associated biology.

         <title>Tricrilactones A&#8211;H, Potent Antiosteoporosis Macrolides with Distinctive Ring Skeletons from Trichocladium crispatum, an Alpine Moss&#8208;Associated Fungus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides, tricrilactones A&#8211;H, was isolated from the moss&#8208;derived fungus T.&#8197;crispatum. Intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments provided evidence for their proposed biosynthetic pathway. The compounds were found to be potent antiosteoporosis agents in vivo, whereby tricrilactone G (top right&#8208;hand structure) restored bone formation&#8208;resorption homeostasis and promoted cartilage and skeletal development.







Abstract
Tricrilactones A&#8211;H (1&#8211;8), a new family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides featuring collectively five unique ring skeletons, were isolated from a hitherto unexplored fungus, Trichocladium crispatum. Compounds 1 and 7 contain two unconventional bridged (aza)tricyclic core skeletons, 2, 3, 5, and 6 share an undescribed tetracyclic 9/5/6/6 ring system, 4 bears an uncommon 9/5/6/10/3&#8208;fused pentacyclic architecture, and 8 is a dimer bridged by an unexpected C&#8722;C linkage. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, quantum chemical calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Importantly, the absolute configuration of the highly flexible side chain of 1 was resolved by the asymmetric synthesis of its four stereoisomers. The intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments facilitated the proposal of the biosynthetic pathway for these macrolides. In addition, their antiosteoporosis effects were evaluated in vivo (zebrafish).

         <title>Unequal Perylene Diimide Twins in a Quadruple Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a quadruple assembly (POP)4, two identical perylene diimide (PDI) units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550). The two groups of spectrally distinct PDI units provide a rapid gradient&#8208;directed energy transfer from P520 to P550.







Abstract
Natural light&#8208;harvesting (LH) systems can divide identical dyes into unequal aggregate states, thereby achieving intelligent &#8220;allocation of labor&#8221;. From a synthetic point of view, the construction of such kinds of unequal and integrated systems without the help of proteinaceous scaffolding is challenging. Here, we show that four octatetrayne&#8208;bridged ortho&#8208;perylene diimide (PDI) dyads (POPs) self&#8208;assemble into a quadruple assembly (POP)4 both in solution and in the solid state. The two identical PDI units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550) in (POP)4. The two extreme pools of PDI chromophores were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. To interpret the formation of the discrete quadruple assembly, we also developed a two&#8208;step cooperative model. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate the existence of multiple couplings within and across P520 and P550, which can satisfactorily describe the photophysical properties of the unequal quadruple assembly. This finding is expected to help advance the rational design of dye stacks to emulate functions of natural LH systems.

         <title>Spatial Localization of Two Enzymes at Pickering Emulsion Droplet Interfaces for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different enzymes were precisely localized at the inner and outer interfaces of Pickering emulsion droplets with the aid of an asymmetrically modified mesoporous nanosheet. This unique system exhibited significantly enhanced cascading efficiency in oxidation reactions by creating reaction microenvironments appropriate for the different enzymes and enabling efficient intermediate transportation at the droplet interfaces.







Abstract
Developing biocatalytic cascades in abiological conditions is of utmost significance, but such processes often suffer from low reaction efficiency because of incompatible reaction environments and suppressed intermediate transportation. Herein we report a new type of biocatalytic cascade by localizing two different enzymes separately in the outer and inner interfacial layers of Pickering emulsion droplets. This versatile approach enables the localization of two enzymes in their preferred reaction microenvironments and simultaneously in nanoscale proximity of each other. The thus&#8208;designed interfacial biocatalytic cascades show outstanding catalytic efficiency in alkene epoxidation and thioether oxidation with in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions, 6.9&#8211;13.6 times higher than the catalytic efficiency of the free enzymes in solution and their multi&#8208;enzymatic counterparts. The remarkable interfacial effect of Pickering droplets was found to be responsible for the significantly enhanced cascading efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Two different enzymes were precisely localized at the inner and outer interfaces of Pickering emulsion droplets with the aid of an asymmetrically modified mesoporous nanosheet. This unique system exhibited significantly enhanced cascading efficiency in oxidation reactions by creating reaction microenvironments appropriate for the different enzymes and enabling efficient intermediate transportation at the droplet interfaces.

         <title>Stable Operation of Lithium Metal Batteries with Aggressive Cathode Chemistries at 4.9&#8197;V</title>

High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries pose severe challenges for the matching of electrolytes with electrodes. The modified electrolyte in this work shows excellent stability against highly active lithium metal anode and aggressive high&#8208;voltage cathode. It presents great potential for practical use considering fire retardancy and low&#8208;temperature tolerance, ensuring a long life span without safety hazards even under extreme conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) pose severe challenges for the matching of electrolytes with aggressive electrodes, especially at low temperatures. Here, we report a rational modification of the Li+ solvation structure to extend the voltage and temperature operating ranges of conventional electrolytes. Ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions as well as the electrochemical window of solvents were tailored to improve oxidation stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, robust and elastic B and F&#8208;rich interphases are formed on both electrodes. Such optimization enables Li||LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells (90.2&#8201;% retention after 400 cycles) and Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells (74.0&#8201;% retention after 200 cycles) to cycle stably at an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.9&#8197;V. Moreover, NCM622 cells deliver a considerable capacity of 143.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, showing great potential for practical uses. The proposed strategy sheds light on further optimization for high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>In situ Interweaved Binder Framework Mitigating the Structural and Interphasial Degradations of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ interweaved binder with multiple binder&#8208;cathode chemical interactions and robust mechanical strength enables a strong cathode framework. By coordinating with transition&#8208;metal ions and preventing the continuous electrolyte attack, the cathode structural integrity and the chemistry/architecture of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase are improved, thus enabling high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading high&#8208;nickel cathodes with excellent stability.







Abstract
The practical viability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes is compromised by the interphasial and structural degradations. Herein, we demonstrate that by applying an in situ interweaved binder, the cycling stability of high&#8208;nickel cathodes can be significantly improved. Specifically, the results show that the resilient binder network immobilizes the transition&#8208;metal ions, suppresses electrolyte oxidative decomposition, and mitigates cathode particles pulverization, thus resulting in suppressed cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover and ameliorated chemistry and architecture of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. Pouch full cells with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes achieve 0.02&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle at 1&#8197;C rate over 1&#8201;000 deep cycles at 4.4&#8197;V (vs. graphite). This work demonstrates a rational structural and compositional design strategy of polymer binders to mitigate the structural and interphasial degradations of high&#8208;Ni cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Intermolecular Charge Separation of Cationic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high contrast to other dimerization modes of ionic radicals, the cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA.+ demonstrates unparalleled spontaneous symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation, generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Such a unique phenomenon sheds new light on fundamental concepts and uncharted material science.







Abstract
A quadrupolar compound Pyr&#8208;BA with two pyrrole&#8208;type nitrogen atoms doped externally was prepared in this work. In high contrast with other &#960; ionic radicals, its cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+ undergoes unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) single&#8208;crystal analysis, absorption and EPR experiments all confirmed that aggregation and lower temperature would help to facilitate this SB&#8208;CS process. Gibbs energy calculations and gauge&#8208;including magnetically induced current simulation both validate that, for Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+, SB&#8208;CS behavior is more favorable than the conventional dimerization mode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows solid single&#8208;crystal evidence for spontaneous SB&#8208;CS between identical ionic radicals. Such a unique phenomenon is of great significance both in terms of fundamental aspects and uncharted material science.

         <title>Directed Evolution of an Iron(II)&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase for Site&#8208;Selective Azidation of Unactivated Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bonds

Directed evolution is used to engineer variants of the dioxygenase SadX that catalyze site&#8208;selective azidation of succinylated amino acids and a succinylated amine as a result of mutations throughout the SadX structure. This result provides a promising starting point for evolving additional variants with activity on structurally distinct substrates and for enabling enzymatic C&#8722;H functionalization with other non&#8208;native functional groups.







Abstract
FeII&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases and oxygenases can catalyze site&#8208;selective functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds via a variety of C&#8722;X bond forming reactions, but achieving high chemoselectivity for functionalization using non&#8208;native functional groups remains rare. The current study shows that directed evolution can be used to engineer variants of the dioxygenase SadX that address this challenge. Site&#8208;selective azidation of succinylated amino acids and a succinylated amine was achieved as a result of mutations throughout the SadX structure. The installed azide group was reduced to a primary amine, and the succinyl group required for azidation was enzymatically cleaved to provide the corresponding amine. These results provide a promising starting point for evolving additional SadX variants with activity on structurally distinct substrates and for enabling enzymatic C&#8722;H functionalization with other non&#8208;native functional groups.

The installed azide group was reduced to a primary amine, and the succinyl group required for azidation was enzymatically cleaved to provide the corresponding amine. These results provide a promising starting point for evolving additional SadX variants with activity on structurally distinct substrates and for enabling enzymatic C&#8722;H functionalization with other non-native functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Nonlinear Optical Switch with a Linearly Tunable Tc Spanning a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a series of isostructural solid&#8208;solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2SxSe1&#8722;xO4 that represent the first NLO switch material exhibiting a linearly tunable phase transition temperature, the switching temperature can be linearly tuned from 430 to 356&#8197;K. This originates from a linear decrease in the phase transition energy barrier that is predominantly controlled by the internal energy difference between phases.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) switch materials that turn on/off second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at a phase transition temperature (Tc) are promising for applications in the fields of photoswitching and optical computing. However, precise control of Tc remains challenging, mainly because a linearly tunable Tc has not been reported to date. Herein, we report a unique selenate, tetragonal P
21c [Ag(NH3)2]2SeO4 with a=b=8.5569(2)&#8197;&#197; and c=6.5208(2)&#8197;&#197; that exhibits a strong SHG intensity (1.3&#215;KDP) and a large birefringence (&#916;nobv.=0.08). This compound forms a series of isostructural solid&#8208;solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2SxSe1&#8722;xO4 (x=0&#8211;1.00) that exhibit excellent NLO switching performance and an unprecedented linearly tunable 
 spanning 430 to 356&#8197;K. The breaking of localized hydrogen bonds between SeO42&#8722; and the cation triggers a phase transition accompanied by hydrogen bond length changes with increasing x and a linear change in the enthalpy

         <title>Engineered Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizers for Effective Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of high&#8208;performance photosensitizers (PSs) was designed and synthesized using a molecular engineering approach for building blocks of RuII metallacycles. Subsequently, the photosensitizer with the highest reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency, biocompatibility, and phototoxicity index (PI), RuD, was selected for safe and effective photodynamic therapy in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Although metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedicine, their clinical translation is still hindered by their inherent dark toxicity. Herein, we report what to our knowledge is the first example of a molecular engineering approach to building blocks of metallacycles for constructing a series of supramolecular PSs (RuA&#8211;RuD), with the aim of simultaneously reducing dark toxicity and enhancing phototoxicity, and consequently obtaining high phototoxicity indexes (PI). Detailed in vitro investigations demonstrate that RuA&#8211;RuD display high cancer cellular uptake and remarkable antitumor activity even under hypoxic conditions. Notably, RuD exhibited no dark toxicity and displayed the highest PI value (&#8776;406). Theoretical calculations verified that RuD has the largest steric hindrance and the lowest singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST, 0.61&#8197;eV). Further in vivo studies confirmed that RuD allows safe and effective phototherapy against A549 tumors.

         <title>ESIPT&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Mode Photoswitches with Fast Molecular Isomerization in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast photoisomerization of a new photoswitchable molecule through excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer can be clearly characterized by the dual&#8208;mode (color and fluorescence) optical behaviors in the solid state. The good photochromism performance and high&#8208;contrast makes it a highly promising tool in the fields of dual&#8208;mode information encryption and high&#8208;density data storage.







Abstract
Photoswitchable materials have attracted considerable attention in various fields. Developing excellent solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;mode photoswitches is an important but challenging task. Herein, we propose a new strategy to construct an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) inspired photoswitch (DiAH&#8208;pht) that possesses aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features and displays a fast molecular isomerization process characterized by dual&#8208;mode behavior in the solid state. Mechanistic studies indicate that introduction of a bulky group can create a folded molecular conformation that provides adequate volume to facilitate photoisomerization and the enhanced ESIPT effect can boost the isomerization process. The feasibility of our strategy was further demonstrated by the activated photoisomerization performance of the Schiff base derivatives. Furthermore, DiAH&#8208;pht shows good performance in the fields of dual&#8208;mode information encryption and high&#8208;density data storage.

         <dc:description>
Catalytic ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and its static helicity memory in a poly(biphenylylacetylene) were achieved by using chiral ammonium salts, as reported by Katsuhiro Maeda, Eiji Yashima, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202217020). The remarkable acceleration of the helix&#8208;induction rate accompanied by strong chiral amplification relies on crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like specific intermolecular complex formation of the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants with chiral ammonium species.

The application of cellulose separators in sodium&#8208;ion batteries faces several challenges. In their Research Article (e202300258), Xing&#8208;Long Wu and co&#8208;workers prepare a composite separator (CP@PPC) using cellulose paper (CP) cured by impregnation with polypropylene carbonate (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, CP@PPC not only opens up additional Na+ migration paths through a new &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; transport mechanism, but also provides a flexible, safe, and environmentally friendly high&#8208;performance separator.

Covalent triazine frameworks were designed as metal&#8208;free and recyclable photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene into benzaldehyde or styrene oxide. As reported by Kai&#8197;A.&#8197;I. Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202216159), the product formation selectivity was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species in pure water.

         <title>Excited State Mixed&#8208;Valence Complexes: From the Special Pair to the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcitation of the low&#8208;lying metal&#8208;bridge charge transfer (MBCT) transition in the homovalent analogue of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion generates an excited state mixed&#8208;valence species {Ru(III&#8722;&#948;)}(&#956;&#8208;pz.&#8722;){Ru(II+&#948;)} with a delocalized electronic structure and remarkably long lifetime (2.8&#8197;ns), permitting intermolecular electron transfer and hinting at potential for designs of artificial photosynthetic systems.







Abstract
Compounds and complexes with mixed&#8208;valence electronic ground states, such as the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, have proven to be excellent vehicles through which to study intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer processes. In a recent contribution by Cadranel and co&#8208;workers, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals photo&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;bridge charge transfer within the homovalent analogue of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, [{(NH3)5Ru}(&#956;&#8208;pz){Ru(NH3)5}]4+, giving rise to two closely lying excited states with mixed&#8208;valence character, one with a shorter lifetime (&#964;=136&#8197;ps) and weakly&#8208;coupled (Robin&#8208;Day Class II) character, the other a longer&#8208;lived (&#964;=2.8&#8197;ns) configurational isomer with more delocalized electronic structure. Electron transfer reactions from the longer&#8208;lived species demonstrate analogies with the photo&#8208;induced reactions of the photosynthetic special pair, suggesting this state as a reference system for excited state mixed&#8208;valency, and a framework from which to explore photocatalytic reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Compounds and complexes with mixed-valence electronic ground states, such as the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, have proven to be excellent vehicles through which to study intramolecular electron-transfer processes. In a recent contribution by Cadranel and co-workers, time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy reveals photo-induced metal-to-bridge charge transfer within the homovalent analogue of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, [{(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Ru}(&#956;-pz){Ru(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, giving rise to two closely lying excited states with mixed-valence character, one with a shorter lifetime (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;=136&#8197;ps) and weakly-coupled (Robin-Day Class II) character, the other a longer-lived (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;=2.8&#8197;ns) configurational isomer with more delocalized electronic structure. Electron transfer reactions from the longer-lived species demonstrate analogies with the photo-induced reactions of the photosynthetic special pair, suggesting this state as a reference system for excited state mixed-valency, and a framework from which to explore photocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer and Spin&#8208;Flip States: Thriving as Complements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer excited states have been at the focus of inorganic photochemistry for decades, together with their strongest opponents: detrimental metal&#8208;centered states. In recent years, interest in metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip states was reignited by a new type of photoactive chromium(III) complex. This Review delineates similarities and unique features of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states, from fundamentals to applications.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes with photoactive charge&#8208;transfer excited states are pervasive throughout the literature. In particular, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), with its metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer emission, has been established as a key complex. Meanwhile, interest in so&#8208;called spin&#8208;flip metal&#8208;centered states has risen dramatically after the molecular ruby [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) led to design principles to access strong, long&#8208;lived emission from photostable chromium(III) complexes. This Review contrasts the properties of emissive charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states by using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ as prototypical examples. We discuss the relevant excited states, the tunability of their energy and lifetimes, and their response to external stimuli. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of charge&#8208;transfer and spin&#8208;flip states in applications such as photocatalysis and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Regulating Spin States in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>

The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. Regulating spin state of active centers could influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. This minireview summarizes approaches for the characterization and regulation of spin states as a basis for the design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable transition metal oxides catalysts for energy conversion processes such as oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction is one of the key measures to solve the problem of energy shortage. The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. In an octahedral structure of transition metal oxides, the spin state of active centers could be regulated by adjusting the splitting energy and the electron pairing energy. Regulating spin state of active centers could directly modulate the d orbitals occupancy, which influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. In this review, we clarified the significance of regulating spin state of the active centers. Subsequently, we discussed several characterization technologies for spin state and some recent strategies to regulate the spin state of the active centers. Finally, we put forward some views on the future research direction of this vital field.

         <title>Complementary Design in Multicomponent Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction: Beyond the Leverage in Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating distinct yet complementary electronic structures of elements in different blocks, this concept is revolutionary in that it breaks the limitations of scaling relations, synchronously achieving high activity and selectivity for electrochemical nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is promising in place of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for artificial N2 fixation. However, the high activity and selectivity of eNRR are challenging to achieve simultaneously due to the scaling relations. Such &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity has severely restricted eNRR. To overcome this bottleneck, the complementary design of electronic structures in multicomponent electrocatalysts has been recently pursued, aiming to maximize the advantages of each component and optimize the multistep reactions, which has stood at the cutting edge in this aspect. Here, we present a minireview of the design, performance, and mechanism of multicomponent electrocatalysts with complementary electronic structures. We particularly emphasize the interactions between N2 and elements from d&#8208;, p&#8208;, and s&#8208;blocks, which are essential for understanding how these electrocatalysts are beyond the &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity.

Photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction provide a promising way to alleviate energy crisis and environmental issues. This review summarizes recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). In addition, the fundamentals of the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs and several advanced characterization techniques to elucidate the photocatalytic process and mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provide promising solutions to global energy and environmental issues. In recent years, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous solids featuring well&#8208;defined and tailorable structures as well as high surface areas, have captured great interest toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. In this review, the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs is first discussed. We then summarize the recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over MOF&#8208;based materials and focus on the unique advantage of MOFs for clarifying the structure&#8208;property relationship in photocatalysis. In addition, some representative characterization techniques have been presented to unveil the photocatalytic kinetics and reaction intermediates in MOF&#8208;based systems. Finally, the challenges, and perspectives for future directions are proposed.

         <title>Deacylative Thiolation by Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Fragmentation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach has been developed to realize deacylative thiolation of common ketones, which provides a unique method to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of deacylative thiolation of diverse methyl ketones. The reaction is redox&#8208;neutral, and heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free, which provides a new way to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. It also features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, thus allowing late&#8208;stage derivatization. The process benefits from efficient condensation between the activation reagent and ketone substrates, which triggers aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;C fragmentation and rapid radical coupling with thiosulfonates. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.

&lt;p&gt;A redox-neutral, heavy-metal-free approach has been developed to realize deacylative thiolation of common ketones, which provides a unique method to introduce thioether groups site-specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the development of deacylative thiolation of diverse methyl ketones. The reaction is redox-neutral, and heavy-metal-free, which provides a new way to introduce thioether groups site-specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. It also features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, thus allowing late-stage derivatization. The process benefits from efficient condensation between the activation reagent and ketone substrates, which triggers aromatization-driven C&#8722;C fragmentation and rapid radical coupling with thiosulfonates. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Chiral Z&#8208;Allylamides by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Sequential Hydrogenations</title>

         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric sequential hydrogenations of conjugated enynes have been developed. The precise synthesis of chiral Z&#8208;allylamides has been realized in high activity (up to 1000&#8197;S/C) and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanism experiment and theoretical calculation supported a reasonable cationic CoI/CoIII redox catalytic cycle, and explained the difference in reactivity between Ph&#8208;BPE&#8208;Co and QuinoxP*&#8208;Co.







Abstract
Asymmetric sequential hydrogenations of conjugated enynes have been developed using a Ph&#8208;BPE&#8208;CoI catalyst for the precise synthesis of chiral Z&#8208;allylamides in high activity (up to 1000 substrate/catalyst (S/C)) and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee)). Mechanism experiments and theoretical calculations support a cationic CoI/CoIII redox catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity difference between cobalt complexes of Ph&#8208;BPE and QuinoxP* was explained by the process decomposition of rate&#8208;determining step in the second hydrogenation.

         <title>Correlative Cellular Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Amperometry Show Dose Dependent Changes in Lipid Composition and Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel analytical tools &#8212; single cell amperometry (SCA), intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC), and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging &#8212; were combined to provide a link between the complex etiology of neurodegenerative diseases and lipidomic information.







Abstract
Aberrant functioning of the proteasome has been associated with crucial pathologic conditions including neurodegeneration. Yet, the complex underlying causes at the cellular level remain unclear and there are conflicting reports of neuroprotective to neurodegenerative effects of proteasomal inhibitors such as lactacystin that are utilised as models for neurodegenerative diseases. The conflicting results may be associated with different dose regimes of lactacystin and hence we have performed a dose dependent study of the effects of lactacystin to identify concurrent changes in the cell membrane lipid profile and the dynamics of exocytosis using a combination of surface sensitive mass spectrometry and single cell amperometry. Significant changes of negatively charged lipids were associated with different lactacystin doses that showed a weak correlation with exocytosis while changes in PE and PE&#8722;O lipids showed dose dependent changes correlated with initial pore formation and total release of vesicle content respectively.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs for Targeted Degradation of Extracellular and Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs have been developed by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GaINAc to realize liver&#8208;cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins. This platform can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through the lysosomal degradation pathway, providing a new method for targeted protein degradation.







Abstract
Recently, lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have emerged as a promising technology that expands the scope of targeted protein degradation to extracellular targets. However, the preparation of chimeras by conjugation of the antibody and trivalent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (tri&#8208;GalNAc) is a complex and time&#8208;consuming process. The large uncertainty in number and position and the large molecular weights of the chimeras result in low internalization efficiency. To circumvent these problems, we developed the first aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (Apt&#8208;LYTAC) to realize liver&#8208;cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GalNAc. Taking advantage of the facile synthesis and low molecular weight of the aptamer, the Apt&#8208;LYTACs can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through a lysosomal degradation pathway. We anticipate that the novel Apt&#8208;LYTACs will expand the usage of aptamers and provide a new dimension for targeted protein degradation.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Triplet Inversions in Non&#8208;Alternant Hydrocarbons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of molecules displaying an inversion of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states has been identified through computational screening of synthesized structures. This observed behavior is attributed to a high&#8208;symmetry pentalene core motif, which is stabilized via aromaticity.







Abstract
Molecules with inversion of the singlet and triplet excited&#8208;state energies are highly promising for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To date, azaphenalenes are the only class of molecules where these inversions have been identified. Here, we screen a curated database of organic crystal structures to identify existing compounds for violations of Hund's rule in the lowest excited states. We identify two further classes with this behavior. The first, a class of zwitterions, has limited relevance to molecular emitters as the singlet&#8208;triplet inversions occur in the third excited singlet state. The second class consists of two D2h&#8208;symmetry non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, a fused azulene dimer and a bicalicene, whose lowest excited singlet states violate Hund's rule. Due to the connectivity of the polycyclic structure, they achieve this symmetry through aromatic stabilization. These hydrocarbons show promise as the next generation of building blocks for OLED emitters.

     alt="Symmetry-Induced Singlet-Triplet Inversions in Non-Alternant Hydrocarbons**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new class of molecules displaying an inversion of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states has been identified through computational screening of synthesized structures. This observed behavior is attributed to a high-symmetry pentalene core motif, which is stabilized via aromaticity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecules with inversion of the singlet and triplet excited-state energies are highly promising for the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). To date, azaphenalenes are the only class of molecules where these inversions have been identified. Here, we screen a curated database of organic crystal structures to identify existing compounds for violations of Hund's rule in the lowest excited states. We identify two further classes with this behavior. The first, a class of zwitterions, has limited relevance to molecular emitters as the singlet-triplet inversions occur in the third excited singlet state. The second class consists of two &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetry non-alternant hydrocarbons, a fused azulene dimer and a bicalicene, whose lowest excited singlet states violate Hund's rule. Due to the connectivity of the polycyclic structure, they achieve this symmetry through aromatic stabilization. These hydrocarbons show promise as the next generation of building blocks for OLED emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide Bond Formation in the Protonated Serine Dimer Following Vacuum UV Photon&#8208;Induced Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While collision induced dissociation of protonated serine dimers leads only to cluster breakup, clear evidence that irradiation by Vacuum UV (PID) light leads to intra&#8208;cluster bond formation is presented. Furthermore, comparison with the PID of serine dipeptides suggests that peptide bond formation is involved in the process.







Abstract
Possible routes for intra&#8208;cluster bond formation (ICBF) in protonated serine dimers have been studied. We found no evidence of ICBF following low energy collision&#8208;induced dissociation (in correspondence with previous works), however, we do observe clear evidence for ICBF following photon absorption in the 4.6&#8211;14&#8197;eV range. Moreover, the comparison of photon&#8208;induced dissociation measurements of the protonated serine dimer to those of a protonated serine dipeptide provides evidence that ICBF, in this case, involves peptide bond formation (PBF). The experimental results are supported by ab initio molecular dynamics and exploration of several excited state potential energy surfaces, unraveling a pathway for PBF following photon absorption. The combination of experiments and theory provides insight into the PBF mechanisms in clusters of amino acids, and reveals the importance of electronic excited states reached upon UV/VUV light excitation.

         <title>Deuterodehalogenation Under Net Reductive or Redox&#8208;Neutral Conditions Enabled by Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific introduction of deuterium is important in organic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the deuterodehalogenation of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides, using inexpensive deuterium oxide as the deuterium source. We also uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates.







Abstract
Interest in deuterated active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is increasing as deuteration holds promise for kinetic isotope effect (KIE) regulated fine&#8208;tuning of API performance. Moreover, deuterium isotope labeling is frequently carried out to study organic and bioorganic reaction mechanisms and to facilitate complex target synthesis. As such, methods for highly selective deuteration of organic molecules are highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the selective deuterodehalogenation of benzylic halides via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, using inexpensive deuterium oxide (D2O) as the deuterium source. We demonstrate broad functional group compatibility across a range of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides. Furthermore, we uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates simply by changing the identity of the sacrificial reductant employed.

         <title>Synthesis of Multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;Sultines by a Photoinduced Radical Addition&#8211;Polar Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed multifluoromethyl radical addition/SO2 incorporation/polar cyclization cascade approach to multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;sultines has been developed. The reaction proceeds with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and good yields. Key to the success of the protocol is use of oxidizable multifluoroalkanesulfinates as bifunctional reagents.







Abstract
Despite the significance of sultines in synthesis, medicine, and materials science, the chemistry of sultines has remained unexplored due to their inaccessibility. Herein, we demonstrate the development of a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed multifluoromethyl radical addition/SO2 incorporation/polar cyclization cascade approach to multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;sultines. The reactions proceed by single electron transfer induced multifluoromethyl radical addition to an alkene followed by SO2 incorporation, and single&#8208;electron reduction for polar 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet cyclization. Key to the success of the protocol is the use of easily oxidizable multifluoroalkanesulfinates as bifunctional reagents. The reactions proceed with excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance to deliver &#947;&#8208;sultines in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Nanostructuring of Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets as Long&#8208;range Ordered Arrays in the Framework of Organic Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first compound with long&#8208;range ordered single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) encapsulated in protective framework was synthesized and its structure and magnetic properties were investigated. This work provides a method to control the nanostructuring of SMM within protective frameworks and further the development of molecular spintronics.







Abstract
The nanostructuring of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) on substrates, in nanotubes and periodic frameworks is highly desired for the future magnetic recording devices. However, the ability to organize SMMs into long&#8208;range ordered arrays in these systems is still lacking. Here, we report the incorporation of magnetic (RECl2(H2O)6)+ (RE=rare earths) molecular groups into the framework of an organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP)&#8212;(H2dabco)CsCl3. Intriguingly, we show the incorporated rare&#8208;earth groups self&#8208;organized into long&#8208;range ordered arrays that uniformly and periodically distributed in the A sites of OMHP. The ordered (RECl2(H2O)6)+ groups serve as SMMs in the perovskite frameworks, exhibiting large effective magnetic moment, moderate magnetic anisotropy and two&#8208;step relaxation behavior. With the additional merit of great structural flexibility and multifunction of OMHPs, the preparation of the first SMMs@OMHP magnetic materials furthers the development of molecular spintronics.

         <title>A Spiro Phosphamide Catalyzed Enantioselective Proton Transfer of Ylides in a Free Carbene Insertion into N&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective free carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond of amines has been achieved. Newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, chiral spiro phosphamides, were found to be key and promote the proton transfer of the ylide intermediates and control the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The reaction provides a new approach to amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
Free carbene readily causes multiple side reactions due to its high energy, thus its asymmetric transformation is very difficult. We present here our findings of high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts that enable free carbene insertion into N&#8722;H bonds of amines to prepare chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantioselectivity. Under irradiation with visible light, diazo compounds produce high&#8208;energy free carbenes that are captured by amines to form free ylide intermediates, and then the newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acids, chiral spiro phosphamides, promote the proton transfer of ylides to afford the products. Computational and kinetic studies uncover the principle for the rational design of proton&#8208;transfer catalysts and explain how the catalysts accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol.

&lt;p&gt;A highly enantioselective free carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond of amines has been achieved. Newly designed high-p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, chiral spiro phosphamides, were found to be key and promote the proton transfer of the ylide intermediates and control the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The reaction provides a new approach to amino acid derivatives.

         <title>Manipulation of the Buried Interface for Robust Formamidinium&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells with NiOx Hole&#8208;Transport Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>

We report a highly efficient and stable formamidinium&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb (FASn0.5Pb0.5I3) perovskite solar cell with NiOx hole&#8208;transport layer, which is realized by manipulating the buried NiOx/perovskite interface with multifunctional 4&#8208;hydroxyphenethyl ammonium halide (OH&#8208;PEAX, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; or I&#8722;) interlayer.







Abstract
Low band gap tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs) are expected to achieve higher efficiencies than Pb&#8208;PSCs and regarded as key components of tandem PSCs. However, the realization of high efficiency is challenged by the instability of Sn2+ and the imperfections at the charge transfer interfaces. Here, we demonstrate an efficient ideal band gap formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb (FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3) PSC, by manipulating the buried NiOx/perovskite interface with 4&#8208;hydroxyphenethyl ammonium halide (OH&#8208;PEAX, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8722;) interlayer, which exhibits fascinating functions of reducing the surface defects of the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL), enhancing the perovskite film quality, and improving both the energy level matching and physical contact at the interface. The effects of different halide anions have been elaborated and a 20.53&#8201;% efficiency is obtained with OH&#8208;PEABr, which is the highest one for FA&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs using NiOx HTLs. Moreover, the device stability is also boosted.

         <title>A Highly Stable Organic Luminescent Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable&#8208;temperature EPR measurements as well as theoretical calculations have been carried out on a highly stable room&#8208;temperature luminescent M&#252;ller hydrocarbon. The results indicate that the hydrocarbon has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a diradical character of 90&#8201;%, with the small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap enabling thermal excitation to a triplet state.







Abstract
It is very challenging to obtain stable room&#8208;temperature luminescent open&#8208;shell singlet diradicals. Herein we report the first stable M&#252;ller's hydrocarbon TTM&#8208;PhTTM with luminescent properties. Variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations show that TTM&#8208;PhTTM has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a diradical character of 90&#8201;%. Because of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, the open&#8208;shell singlet ground state can be thermally excited to a triplet state. TTM&#8208;PhTTM shows room&#8208;temperature deep&#8208;red emission in various solutions. Unusually high stability of TTM&#8208;PhTTM was also observed owing to effective steric hindrance and spin delocalization. Our results are beneficial to the rational design and discovery of more stable luminescent diradical materials.

         <title>Diazadiboraacenes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a series of diazadiborabenzo[b]triphenylenes as novel B,N&#8208;acenes via a stable biradical is presented. Characterization of their photophysical properties revealed that the emission spectra can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron atom. In addition, short&#8208;lived phosphorescence has been demonstrated.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms into hydrocarbon compounds greatly expands the chemical space of molecular materials. In this context, B&#8722;N doping takes a center stage due to its isosterism with a C=C&#8208;bond. Herein, we present a new and modular synthetic concept to access novel diazadiborabenzo[b]triphenylenes 7&#8201;a&#8211;h using the B&#8722;N doped biradical 16 as intermediate. Characterization of the photophysical properties revealed the emission spectra of the diazadibora benzo[b]triphenylenes 7&#8201;a&#8211;h can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron&#8208;atom. All of the diazadibora compounds show a short life&#8208;time phosphorescence. Additionally, we were able to rationalize the excited&#8208;state relaxation of the diazadiboraacene 7&#8201;a via intersystem crossing by quantum chemical calculations. The new synthetic strategy provides an elegant route to various novel B&#8722;N doped acenes with great potential for applications in molecular materials.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bilayer nanographene (EP9H) containing a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized with an extended &#960;&#8208;system perpendicular to the helical axis of [9]helicene. Furthermore, the structure extension induced significant improvements in the fluorescence quantum yield and circularly polarized luminescence, as evident from the large glum and BCPL values.







Abstract
A novel chiral nanographene (i.e. EP9H) with a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized and fully characterized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction unambiguously confirms the helical structure. The fluorescence emission of EP9H is located in the near infrared region (&#955;em=684&#8197;nm) with a medium quantum yield (0.10) for helicene derivatives. Cyclic voltammetry reveals its seven quasi&#8208;reversible redox states from &#8722;2 to +5. Furthermore, enantiopure EP9H displays distinct CD signals in a broad spectral range from 300 to 700&#8197;nm. Notably, compared to the reported small organic molecules, EP9H displays an outstanding |glum| value of 4.50&#215;10&#8722;2 and BCPL as 304&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 Chalcogenide Perovskite Films Using Single&#8208;Phase Molecular Precursors at Moderate Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a single&#8208;phase, solution&#8208;processed approach to create thin films of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 at temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C with sulfurization times as short as 20&#8197;min. To create molecular precursor inks, we utilized known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to synthesize Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates and extended this chemistry to create species such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have not been reported before.







Abstract
Chalcogenide perovskites have garnered interest for applications in semiconductor devices due to their excellent predicted optoelectronic properties and stability. However, high synthesis temperatures have historically made these materials incompatible with the creation of photovoltaic devices. Here, we demonstrate the solution processed synthesis of luminescent BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 chalcogenide perovskite films using single&#8208;phase molecular precursors at sulfurization temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C and sulfurization times as short as one hour. These molecular precursor inks were synthesized using known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to create Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates, and this chemistry was extended to create species, such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have never been reported before. These findings, with added future research, have the potential to yield fully solution processed thin films of chalcogenide perovskites for various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion Enabled by Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Triatomic Sites in Partially Oxidized Bimetallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two metallic sites in a pristine bimetallic sulfide do not form sufficiently tight bonds with the C2 intermediate during CO2 photoreduction, which results in an incomplete C&#8722;C coupling, thus giving mixtures of C1 and C2 products. Partial oxidation of the bimetallic sulfide leads to the formation of triatomic sites, enabling enhanced C&#8722;C coupling of the key intermediates to selectively generate C2 products.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction into C2 fuels under mild conditions suffers from low product yield and poor selectivity owing to the kinetic challenge of C&#8722;C coupling. Here, triatomic sites are introduced into bimetallic sulfide to promote C&#8722;C coupling for selectively forming C2 products. As an example, FeCoS2 atomic layers with different oxidation degrees are first synthesized, demonstrated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Both experiment and theoretical calculation verify more charges aggregate around the introduced oxygen atom, which enables the original Co&#8722;Fe dual sites to turn into Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe triatomic sites, thus promoting C&#8722;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates. Accordingly, the mildly oxidized FeCoS2 atomic layers exhibit C2H4 formation rate of 20.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, with the product selectivity and electron selectivity of 82.9&#8201;% and 96.7&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts under similar conditions.

         <title>Chiral Calix[3]pyrrole Derivatives: Synthesis, Racemization Kinetics, and Ring Expansion to Calix[9]&#8208; and Calix[12]pyrrole Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently chiral calix[3]pyrrole derivative was synthesized from a polyketone precursor. Although the macrocycle racemizes through ring inversion at room temperature, N&#8208;methylation effectively suppressed the racemization, allowing chiral resolution of the enantiomers. Ring expansion reaction allowed access to calix[9]&#8208; and calix[12]pyrrole&#8208;type macrocycles, the largest of which was characterized by an X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Chiral pyrrolic macrocycles continue to attract interest. However, their molecular design remains challenging. Here, we report a calixpyrrole&#8208;based chiral macrocyclic system, calix[1]furan[1]pyrrole[1]thiophene (1), synthesized from an oligoketone. Macrocycle 1 adopts a partial cone conformation in the solid state, and undergoes racemization via ring inversion. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that inversion of the thiophene is the rate determining step. Pyrrole N&#8208;methylation suppressed racemization and permitted chiral resolution. Enantioselective N&#8208;methylation also occurred in the presence of a chiral ammonium salt, although the stereoselectivity is modest. A unique feature of 1 is that it acts as a useful synthetic precursor to yield several calix[n]furan[n]pyrrole[n]thiophene products (n=2&#8211;4), including a calix[12]pyrrole analogue that to our knowledge constitutes the largest calix[n]pyrrole&#8208;like species to be structurally characterized.

         <title>Highly Strained Oxygen&#8208;Doped Chiral Molecular Belts of the Zigzag&#8208;Type with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 15, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy has been used to synthesize depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. The approach involved the closure of fjords at the upper rim and the growth of fused rings at the lower rim of resorcin[4]arene derivatives to afford highly strained chiral belts having excellent CPL properties, with |glum| up to 0.022.







Abstract
Herein we report a two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phenalenes has been developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O&#8208;doped C2&#8208;symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (&#956;) and magnetic (m) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|glum| up to 0.022). This study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt&#8208;derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.

         <title>Designing Breathing Air&#8208;electrode and Enhancing the Oxygen Electrocatalysis by Thermoelectric Effect for Efficient Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish kinetics and mutual interference of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) in the air electrode resulted in large charge/discharge overpotential and low energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air batteries. In this work, we designed a breathing air&#8208;electrode configuration in Zn&#8208;air batteries using P&#8208;type Ca3Co4O9 and N&#8208;type CaMnO3 as charge and discharge thermoelectrocatalysts, respectively. The Seebeck voltages generated from thermoelectric effect of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 synergistically compensated the OER and ORR overpotentials. The carrier migration and accumulation on the cold surface of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 optimized the electronic structure of metallic sites and thus enhanced their intrinsic catalytic activity. The OER and ORR overpotentials were enhanced by 101 and 90 mV, respectively, at temperature gradient of 200 &#176;C. The breathing Zn&#8208;air battery displayed a remarkable energy efficiency of 68.1%. This work provides an ef&#64257;cient avenue towards utilizing waste heat for improving the energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;promoted Electrocatalytic Graphitization of Biochars for Energy Storage: Mechanistic Understanding using Multi&#8208;scale Approaches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to high&#8208;efficiency and scalable advantages of electrolysis in molten salts, electrochemical conversion of carbonaceous resources into graphitic products is a sustainable route for achieving high value&#8208;added carbon. To understand the complicated kinetics of converting amorphous carbon (e.g. carbonized lignin&#8208;biochar) into highly graphitic carbon, herein this study reports the key processing parameters (addition of Ni, temperature and time) and multi&#8208;scale approach of nickel&#8208;boosted electrochemical graphitization&#8208;catalysis processes in molten calcium chloride. Upon both experiments and modellings, multi&#8208;scale analysis that ranges from nanoscale atomic reaction to macroscale cell reveal the multi&#8208;field evolution in the electrolysis cell, mechanism of electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as pathway of nickel&#8208;boosted graphitization and tubulization. The results of as&#8208;achieved controllable processing regions and multi&#8208;scale approaches provide a rational strategy of manipulating electrochemical graphitization processes and utilizing the converted biomass resources for high value&#8208;added use.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Production of CO from Organic Pollutants by Coupling Piezocatalysis and Advanced Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, the chemical conversion of organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks rather than CO2 remains a major challenge. Herein, we successfully develop a piezocatalysis coupling advanced oxidation process (AOP) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs, and then the as&#8208;obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 can not only effectively promote the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realize the highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved the selective generation of CO in the actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical application prospect.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence from Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size and composition&#8208;tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into the PeNCs host (Yb3+:PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000 nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb3+ ions by the PeNC host. Efficient quantum cutting processes enable high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 126% from the Yb3+:PeNCs. Through halide&#8208;composition engineering and surface passivation strategy to improve both PLQY and charge transport balance, we demonstrate an efficient NIR LED with a peak EQE of 7.7% at a central wavelength of 990 nm, representing the most efficient perovskite&#8208;based LEDs with emission wavelengths beyond 850 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity and Hydrogen Bonding Allow&#160;Efficient Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduction of CO2 selectively to one of the several C1 based product presents a challenge as the thermodynamic reduction potentials of the different ne&#8208;/nH+ reduction of CO2 are similar and so is the reduction potential for H+ reduction. Halime, Aukauloo and co&#8208;workers have utilized the design principles of the active site of Nickle CO dehydrogenase (Ni CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by urea moiety. These complexes show faster and selective reduction of CO2 to CO and their results are suggestive of a Ni CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metal binds and reduces the CO2 while the other stabilize the reduced species by forming a bridged complex&#160;and facilitates C&#8208;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Starch&#8208;Based Superabsorbent Hydrogel with High Electrolyte Retention Capability and Synergistic Interface Engineering for Long&#8208;Lifespan Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs)&#160;with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half&#8208;open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein,&#160;a starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE)&#160;with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as&#8208;fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300 h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Caging of Carboxyl Groups for On&#8208;Demand Protein Activation with Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tools for on&#8208;demand protein activation enable impactful gain&#8208;of&#8208;function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Here, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated&#160;acids&#160;can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent&#8208;accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active&#8208;site Glu35 with a pKa&#160;of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self&#8208;immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small&#8208;molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>A BN&#8208;Doped U&#8208;Shaped Heteroacene as a Molecular Floating Gate for Ambipolar Charge Trapping Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two wide&#8208;bandgap U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN&#8208;) doping (BN&#8208;1 and C&#8208;1) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements in organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory (OFET&#8208;NVM). The chemical structures were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and single crystal diffraction. Owing to the electron donor effect of N and the high electron affinity of B, the BN&#8208;1&#8208;based OFET&#8208;NVM displays large ambipolar memory windows and an enhanced charge storage density compared to C&#8208;1 and most of the reported small molecules. A novel supramolecular system formed via BN&#8208;1 and PMMA contributes to fabricating uniform films with homogeneous microstructures, which serve as a two&#8208;in&#8208;one tunnelling dielectric and charge trapping layer to realize long&#8208;term charge retention and reliable endurance. Our results demonstrate that both BN doping and supramolecular engineering are crucial for the charge trapping of OFET&#8208;NVM</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Preparation of Benzoxazine&#8208;based Phenolic Resins Enables Long&#8208;term Sustainable Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of polymer structures at the molecular level promotes the iteration of high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production from oxygen and water, which also lays the basis for revealing the reaction mechanism. Here we report a benzoxazine&#8208;based m&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;formaldehyde resin (APFac) polymerized at ambient conditions, exhibiting superior H2O2 yield and long&#8208;term stability to most polymeric photocatalysts. Benzoxazine structure was identified as the crucial photocatalytic active segment in APFac. Favorable adsorption of oxygen/intermediates on benzoxazine structure and commendable product selectivity accelerated the reaction kinetically in stepwise single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The proposed benzoxazine&#8208;based phenolic resin provides the possibility of production in batches and industrial application, and sheds light on the de novo design and analysis of metal&#8208;free polymeric photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self&#8208;assembled&#160;left&#8208;handed DNA (L&#8208;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single&#8208;domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi&#8208;specific targeting, multi&#8208;specific payloads, and exact drug&#8208;antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8208;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that the L&#8208;DNA based modular ADC (MADC) platform is a viable option for generating therapeutic ADCs and for potentially expanding ADC therapeutic window via multi&#8208;specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP)&#8208;Based Straight&#8208;Shaped Diphosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[1.1.1]Propellane, which is structurally simple and compact, exhibits promising potential for the synthesis of disubstituted straight&#8208;shaped bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) compounds by manipulation of its highly reactive internal C&#8211;C bond. BCPs are considered to be isosteres of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted benzenes, which have found broad applications in the areas of functional molecules and drug discovery. The internal C&#8211;C single bond of [1.1.1]propellane is regarded as a charge&#8208;shift bond, which can be readily cleaved by radical means to construct BCPs. We herein report a novel synthetic method for (un)symmetric diphosphines based on the BCP motif, which can be interpreted as isosteres of 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)benzenes. The obtained BCP&#8208;diphosphine derivatives were used to generate a straight&#8208;shaped Au complex and an Eu&#8208;based coordination polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type Reaction of 5&#8208;(Chloromethyl)furfural via Trienolate Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of the biomass&#8208;derived platform compound 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) with imines were developed. A series of high&#8208;value&#8208;added chiral amines were afforded in good to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The bifunctional NHC derived from &#671;&#8208;pyroglutamic acid was efficient to steer the remote addition of trienolate intermediate to imine in a highly stereocontrolled manner. This represents the first example of enantioselective reactions via NHC&#8208;bound trienolate intermediate.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Experience in both catalyst and reaction design is required to solve remaining limitations and to set new standards &#8230; In contrast to previous studies, we aimed at the design of new catalysts based on data rather than on chemical intuition.&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Gessner and Goo&#223;en groups on accelerating catalyst and reaction development.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Gessner and Goo&#223;en research groups at Ruhr&#8208;University Bochum (Germany). They recently published a series of articles in Angewandte Chemie on the application of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines (YPhos) in palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. Owing to their inherently strong sigma&#8208;donating ability and their modular synthesis, YPhos ligands can be tailored to fit the demands of various catalytic transformations. In the most recent article, machine learning methods were applied to identify a YPhos catalyst that enables the previously elusive Hiyama coupling of aryl chlorides. &#8220;Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings&#8221;, J.&#8197;F.

         <title>Precise Epitope Organization with Self&#8208;adjuvant Framework Nucleic Acid for Efficient COVID&#8208;19 Peptide Vaccine Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide vaccines have advantages in easy fabrication and high safety, but their effectiveness is subjected to the poor immunogenicity of epitopes themselves. Herein, we constructed a series of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) with regulated rigidity and size as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers to precisely organize epitopes, in order to reveal the influence of epitope spacing and carrier rigidity on the efficiency of peptide vaccines. We found that assembling epitopes on rigid tetrahedral FNAs (tFNAs) with the appropriate size could efficiently enhance their immunogenicity. Further, by integrating epitopes from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on preferred tFNAs, we constructed a COVID&#8208;19 peptide vaccine which could induce high titers of IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, and increase the ratio of memory B and T cells in mice. Considering the good biocompatibility of tFNAs, our research provided a new idea for developing efficient peptide vaccines against viruses and possibly other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circumcoronenes were finally obtained by solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolated in crystalline form. The Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers or alkynes was employed as the key reaction. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations confirmed a structure with seven aromatic sextets and six localized K&#8208;region double bonds.







Abstract
Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing three derivatives of circumcoronene using Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ether or alkyne. Their structures were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis, NMR measurement, and theoretical calculations showed that circumcoronene mostly follows Clar's bonding model and exhibits dominant local aromaticity. Its absorption and emission spectra are similar to those of the smaller hexagonal coronene due to its six&#8208;fold symmetry.

         <title>Superhydrophobic and Conductive Wire Membrane for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic, conductive and hierarchical wire (CuO/F/C(w)) membrane composed of porous core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) is fabricated by a facile electrospinning strategy. Advantageous features of this membrane electrode including maximized triple&#8208;phase interfaces on highly exposed CuO, good conductivity and hierarchical architecture enable adequate CO2 supply and effective electron/mass transfer, and afford numerous active sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPI) are essential for promoting electrochemical CO2 reduction, but it remains challenging to maximize their efficiency while integrating other desirable properties conducive to electrocatalysis. Herein, we report the elaborate design and fabrication of a superhydrophobic, conductive, and hierarchical wire membrane in which core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, carbon nanotubes (CNT), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are integrated into a wire structure (designated as CuO/F/C(w); F, PTFE; C, CNT; w, wire) to maximize their respective functions. The realized architecture allows almost all CuO nanospheres to be exposed with effective TPI and good contact to conductive CNT, thus increasing the local CO2 concentration on the CuO surface and enabling fast electron/mass transfer. As a result, the CuO/F/C(w) membrane attains a Faradaic efficiency of 56.8&#8201;% and a partial current density of 68.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for multicarbon products at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in the H&#8208;type cell, far exceeding 10.1&#8201;% and 13.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for bare CuO.

         <title>Ammonium Ion Batteries: Material, Electrochemistry and Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries have shown great potential due to their unique advantages including their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics in low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. Compared with the common metal cations batteries AIBs offer great advantages of favorable sustainability and fast diffusion kinetics with hydrogen bond in different electrode materials.







Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have recently attracted increasing attention in the field of aqueous batteries owing to their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics. The NH4+ storage mechanism is quite different from that of spherical metal ions (e.g. Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and host materials. Although many materials have been proposed as electrode materials for AIBs, their performances hardly meet the requirement of future electrochemical energy storage devices. It is thus urgent to design and exploit advanced materials for AIBs. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research on AIBs. The insights into the basic configuration, operating mechanism and recent progress of electrode materials and corresponding electrolytes for AIBs have been comprehensively outlined. The electrode materials are classified and compared according to different NH4+ storage behaviour in the structure.

     alt="Ammonium Ion Batteries: Material, Electrochemistry and Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonium-ion batteries have shown great potential due to their unique advantages including their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics in low-cost energy storage systems. Compared with the common metal cations batteries AIBs offer great advantages of favorable sustainability and fast diffusion kinetics with hydrogen bond in different electrode materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) have recently attracted increasing attention in the field of aqueous batteries owing to their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics. The NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage mechanism is quite different from that of spherical metal ions (e.g. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and host materials. Although many materials have been proposed as electrode materials for AIBs, their performances hardly meet the requirement of future electrochemical energy storage devices. It is thus urgent to design and exploit advanced materials for AIBs. This review highlights the state-of-the-art research on AIBs. The insights into the basic configuration, operating mechanism and recent progress of electrode materials and corresponding electrolytes for AIBs have been comprehensively outlined. The electrode materials are classified and compared according to different NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage behaviour in the structure. The challenges, design strategies and perspectives are also discussed for the future development of AIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8208;Aryl Glycosylation by Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroaryl Glycosyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones undergo desulfonylative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling with aryl&#8208;substituted nucleophiles or electrophiles through two complementary catalytic systems. The reactions offer access to a wide variety of C&#8208;aryl glycoside products with high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are increasingly gaining attention in carbohydrate chemistry because they enable glycosyl precursors, readily accessible as anomeric mixtures, to converge to a single diastereomeric product. However, controlling the stereochemical outcome through transition&#8208;metal catalysis remains challenging, and methods that leverage bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfone donors to facilitate glycosylation are rare. Herein, we show two complementary nonprecious metal catalytic systems, based on iron or nickel, which are capable of promoting efficient C&#8722;C coupling between heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones and aromatic nucleophiles or electrophiles through distinct mechanisms and modes of activation. Diverse C&#8208;aryl glycosides were secured with excellent selectivity, scope, and functional&#8208;group compatibility, and reliable access to both &#945; and &#946; isomers was possible for key sugar residues.

         <title>Construction of Multiform Hollow&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Facile and Universal Strategy for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond was proposed for the fast synthesis of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs), achieving the construction of a HCOFs library with diverse nanostructures. The synthesized HCOFs with abundant cavities are ideal nanocarriers for high&#8208;efficiency drug loading, thus enhancing the sonodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The special structural morphology of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) has an important influence on their applications. However, the rapid and precise control of morphology for HCOFs still remains largely challenging. Herein, we present a facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond for the controllable synthesis of HCOFs. The strategy enables to prepare HCOFs in a greatly shortened reaction time and seven kinds of HCOFs are fabricated by the oxidation of imine bond via hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated from Fenton reaction. Importantly, a fascinating library of HCOFs with diverse nanostructures, including bowl&#8208;like, yolk&#8208;shell, capsule&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like morphologies, has been ingeniously constructed. Owing to the large cavities, the obtained HCOFs are ideal candidates for drug delivery, which are employed to load five small molecule drugs, achieving the enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy in vivo.

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8208;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective synthesis of AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers has been rarely reported. Here, ethylene oxide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst owing to a Janus effects of Lewis acid on the activity of the two monomers.







Abstract
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Guided Nickel&#8208;Indium Heterogeneous Alloy Electrocatalysts for Promoting the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch guides the selective alloying of tetragonal In to fcc Ni rather than hcp Ni. The heterogeneous alloy with 5&#8197;at% In catalyzes the electrochemical production of 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with 9.15&#8197;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency at 400&#8197;mV vs. RHE in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
The immiscibility of crystallographic facets in multi&#8208;metallic catalysts plays a key role in driving the green H2 production by water electrolysis. The lattice mismatch between tetragonal In and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Ni is 14.9&#8201;% but the mismatch with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) Ni is 49.8&#8201;%. Hence, in a series of Ni&#8722;In heterogeneous alloys, In is selectively incorporated in the fcc Ni. The 18&#8211;20&#8197;nm Ni particles have 36&#8197;wt&#8201;% fcc phase, which increases to 86&#8201;% after In incorporation. The charge transfer from In to Ni, stabilizes the Ni0 state and In develops a fractional positive charge that favors *OH adsorption. With only 5&#8197;at% In, 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 is evolved at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with mass activity of 57.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at&#8212;400&#8197;mV, 200&#8197;h stability at &#8722;0.18&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Pt&#8208;like activity at high current densities, due to the spontaneous water dissociation, lower activation energy barrier, optimal adsorption energy of OH&#8722; ions and the prevention of catalyst poisoning.

         <title>Synthesis of Bandgap&#8208;tunable Transition Metal Sulfides through Gas&#8208;phase Cation Exchange&#8208;induced Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of cation exchange with different crystal structures is limited. We propose a new descriptor, the parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), to synthesize transition metal sulfides with crystal structure selectivity by gas&#8208;phase cation exchange&#8208;induced topological transformation. Powered by precise synthetic control, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is improved by 36.2 times after band gap engineering.

Oriented synthesis of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) with controlled compositions and crystal structures has long been promising for electronic devices and energy applications. Liquid&#8208;phase cation exchange (LCE) is a well&#8208;studied route by varying the compositions. However, achieving crystal structure selectivity is still a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate gas&#8208;phase cation exchange (GCE), which can induce a specific topological transformation (TT), for the synthesis of versatile TMSs with identified cubic or hexagonal crystal structures. The parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), a new descriptor, is defined to describe the substitution of cations and the transition of the anion sublattice. Under this principle, the band gap of targeted TMSs can be tailored. Using the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as an example, the optimal hydrogen evolution rate of a zinc&#8208;cadmium sulfide (ZCS4) is determined to be 11.59&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, showing a 36.2&#8208;fold improvement over CdS.

&lt;p&gt;The occurrence of cation exchange with different crystal structures is limited. We propose a new descriptor, the parallel six-sided subunit (PSS), to synthesize transition metal sulfides with crystal structure selectivity by gas-phase cation exchange-induced topological transformation.

         <title>Covalent Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed alkyne trimerization followed by oxidating coupling and fusion of zinc porphyrin units was used to construct a porphyrin nanoring around a central covalent spoke. The size and shape of these nanorings (diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm) was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). A combination of zinc(II) and nickel(II) porphyrin units was used to increase the efficiency of the synthesis and control the positions of oxidative fusion.







Abstract
Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorophyll arrays and offer insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15&#8208;linked porphyrins. This porphyrin octadecamer was constructed using a covalent six&#8208;armed template, made by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of an H&#8208;shaped tolan with porphyrin trimer ends. The porphyrins around the circumference of the nanoring were linked together by intramolecular oxidative meso&#8208;meso coupling and partial &#946;&#8208;&#946; fusion, to give a nanoring consisting of six edge&#8208;fused zinc(II) porphyrin dimer units and six un&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrins. STM imaging on a gold surface confirms the size and shape of the spoked 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring (calculated diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm).

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Stabilized Defective Black Phosphorene as a Lithium&#8208;Like Catalyst for Boosting Nitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and feasible strategy is proposed for obtaining environmentally stable defective black phosphorene via simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection. Due to the inherent high chemical reactivity, the fluorine&#8208;stabilized defective black phosphorene as a nitrogen reduction electrocatalyst induces a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero&#8208;carbon emission method for NH3 synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N2 by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8722;BPene) is proposed as a lithium&#8208;like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N2 activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8722;BPene by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions. Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine&#8208;stabilized D&#8722;BPene can induce a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8722;BPene, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.

         <title>Amplification of Dissymmetry for Circularly Polarized Photodetection by Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available point chirality units have been embedded adjacent to dicyanostilbene moieties in monomers to effect cooperative supramolecular polymerization. This effective and economic approach based on the synergistic participation of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, which facilitate remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core, allows photodetection based on circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Circularly polarized photodetectors require chiral light absorption materials with high sensing efficiency and low costs. Here readily accessible point chirality has been introduced to dicyanostilbenes as the chiral source, facilitating remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;aromatic core by cooperative supramolecular polymerization. The single&#8208;handed supramolecular polymers display powerful circularly polarized photodetection capability with a dissymmetry factor value as high as 0.83, superior to those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and oligomers. Strong chiral amplification occurs between the enantiopure sergeants and the achiral soldiers. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit comparable photodetection efficiency to those of the homopolymeric ones, with a 90&#8201;% decrease in the enantiopure compound consumption. Therefore, cooperative supramolecular polymerization provides an effective yet economical avenue toward circularly polarized photodetection applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Nickelation of a Crystalline Trinuclear Copper Organic Framework for Synergistic Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic framework was fabricated by post&#8208;modification of the copper&#8208;containing organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu) with divalent nickel ions. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and nickel ions resulted in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO with a high conversion rate and selectivity.







Abstract
Rational regulation of electronic structures and functionalities of framework materials still remains challenging. Herein, reaction of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tribenzhydrazide with tris(&#956;2&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N,N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper (Cu3Py3) generates the crystalline copper organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu). Post&#8208;modification with divalent nickel ions affords the heterometallic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni). Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical simulations reveal their two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal structure geometry. A series of advanced spectroscopic techniques disclose the mixed CuI/CuII state nature of Cu3Py3 in USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with a uniform bistable Cu34+(CuI2CuII)&#8201;:&#8201;Cu35+(CuICuII2) (ca. 1&#8201;:&#8201;3) oxidation state, resulting in a significantly improved formation efficiency of the charge&#8208;separation state. This endows the Ni sites with enhanced activity and USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with outstanding photocatalytic CO2 to CO performance with a conversion rate of 22&#8201;130&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98&#8201;%.

         <title>Sulfonyl&#8208;PYBOX Ligands Enable Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Azides by CuAAC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides by Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (CuAAC), providing facile access to chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary azides and 1,2,3&#8208;trazoles with newly developed PYBOX ligands with a C4 sulfonyl group. The key role of the C4 sulfonyl in tuning the electronic and steric properties of the chiral catalysts to enhance enantiomer discrimination is rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Newly developed pyridine&#8208;bisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands, bearing a C4 sulfonyl group, enable effective kinetic resolution of racemic azides derived from privileged scaffolds such as indanone, cyclopentenone, and oxindole, and their asymmetric CuAAC to afford &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high to excellent ee values. DFT calculations and control experiments reveal that the C4 sulfonyl group decreases the Lewis basicity of the ligand and increases the electrophilicity of the copper center for better recognition of azides, and functions as a shielding group to make the chiral pocket of the catalyst more effective.

         <title>Facile Access to Cyclopropylboronates via Stereospecific Deborylative Cyclization: A Leaving Group&#8208;Assisted Activation of Geminal Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported a transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy, based on which two routes have been developed, generating racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates, respectively. The cyclization of geminal bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective, tolerating various functional groups and heterocycles. When optically active epoxides were used as the starting materials, enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates could be efficiently prepared with &gt;99% stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies showed that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position played a crucial role and significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Dimerization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established. The discovery of the extremely active iron catalyst enables to perform aerobic enzyme&#8208;mimetic oxidation in the flask. This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides with remarkable functional group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method will provide facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with the unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which would serve as a powerful tool to create new small&#8208; or middle&#8208;molecule drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply&#8208;Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of PtIV prodrugs that are reduced into the therapeutically active PtII species within the tumor microenvironment has received much research interest. In order to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment, there is a high demand for the development of compounds that could be selectively activated upon irradiation. Despite recent progress, the majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds for superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate inside a mouse colon carcinoma tumor upon intravenous injection as well as able to eradicate the tumor upon exposure to ultrasound radiation.</dc:description>
