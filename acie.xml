         <title>Metalla&#8208;Carbaporphyrinoids Consisting of an Acyclic N&#8208;Confused Tetrapyrrole Analogue Served as Stable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein the synthesis of novel pseudo&#8208;metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species (1M: M = Pd and Pt) achieved through the inner coordination of palladium(II) and platinum(II) with an acyclic N&#8208;confused tetrapyrrin analogue. Despite their tetrapyrrole frameworks being small, akin to well&#8208;known porphyrins, these species exhibit an unusually narrow HOMO&#8722;LUMO gap, resulting in an unprecedentedly low&#8208;energy absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. DFT calculations revealed unique d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structures involving the metal d&#960;&#8208;ligand p&#960; hybridized molecular orbitals of 1M. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy confirmed distinct electronic structures. Remarkably, the complexes feature an open&#8208;metal coordination site in the peripheral NN dipyrrin site, forming hetero&#8208;metal complexes (1Pd&#8208;BF2 and 1Pt&#8208;BF2) through boron difluoride complexation. The resulting hetero metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species displayed further redshifted NIR&#8208;II absorption, highly efficient photothermal conversion efficiencies (&#951;; 62&#8211;65%), and exceptional photostability. Despite the challenges associated with the theoretical and experimental assessment of d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated metalla&#8208;aromaticity in relatively larger (more than 18&#960; electrons) polycyclic ring systems, these organometallic planar tetrapyrrole systems could serve as potential molecular platforms for aromaticity&#8208;relevant NIR&#8208;II dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Metalation Applications of TMP&#8208;powered Fe and Co(II) Bis(amides): Synthesis, Structure and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typified by LiTMP and TMPMgCl.LiCl, (TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide), s&#8208;block metal amides have found widespread applications in arene deprotonative metalation. On the contrary transition metal amides lack sufficient basicity to activate these substrates.&#160;Breaking new ground in this field, here we present the synthesis and full characterisation of earth abundant transition metals M(TMP)2&#160;(M= Fe, Co). Uncovering a new reactivity profile towards fluoroarenes these amide complexes can promote direct M&#8722;H exchange processes regioselectively using one or two of their basic amide arms. Remarkably even when using perfluorinated substrate, selective CH&#8208;metalation occurs leaving C&#8722;F bonds intact. Their kinetic basicity can be boosted by LiCl or (nBu)4NCl additives which enables formation of kinetically activated ate species. Combining spectroscopic and structural studies with DFT calculations, mechanistic insights have been gained on how these low polarity metalation processes take place. M(TMP)2&#160;can also be used to access ferrocene and cobaltocene by direct deprotonation of cyclopentadiene and to undergo efficient CO2&#160;insertion of both amide groups under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Hydrophobic Cavity Surface of Azocalix[4]arene to Enable Biotin/Avidin Affinity with Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial receptors that combine ultrahigh&#8208;affinity binding and controllable release for active guests holds significant importance in biomedical applications. On one hand, a complex with an exceedingly high binding affinity can resist unwanted dissociation induced by dilution effect and complex interferents within physiological environments. On the other hand, stimulus&#8208;responsive release of the guest is essential for precisely activating its function. In this context, we expanded hydrophobic cavity surface of a hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene, affording Naph&#8208;SAC4A. This modification significantly enhanced its aqueous binding affinity to 1013 M&#8722;1, akin to the naturally occurring strongest recognition pair, biotin/(strept&#8208;)avidin. Consequently, Naph&#8208;SAC4A emerges as the first artificial receptor to simultaneously integrate ultrahigh recognition affinity and actively controllable release. The markedly enhanced affinity not only improved Naph&#8208;SAC4A's sensitivity in detecting rocuronium bromide in serum, but also refined the precision of hypoxia&#8208;responsive doxorubicin delivery at the cellular level, demonstrating its immense potential for diverse practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversified Synthesis of Chiral Fluorinated Cyclobutane Derivatives Enabled by Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160; diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives has remained a tough task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a switchable paradigm for asymmetric hydroboration and formal hydrodefluorination of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclobutenes via rhodium catalysis, providing chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes and monofluorinated cyclobutenes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respevtively. The key to the success of the two transformations relies on an efficient, mild and highly selective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration with HBPin (pinacolborane), in which the subsequent addition of a base, and a catalytic amount of palladium if necessary, results in the formation of formal hydrodefluorination products with the four&#8208;membered ring&#160;retained. The obtained chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes are versatile building blocks, which provides a platform for the synthesis of enantioenriched fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives to a great diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Properties of Trioxa[9]circulene and Diepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents trioxa[9]circulene (3) as a novel member of hetero[n]circulenes. Its synthesis began with the synthesis of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene (5) and used dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene (4) as a key intermediate, despite the condensation reaction predominantly yielding a 1,4&#8208;addition byproduct. The structures and properties of 3&#8211;5 were extensively investigated using experimental and computational methods. Analysis of the crystal structures reveal elongation of the internal C&#8208;C bonds in the nine&#8208;membered ring of 3 compared to 4 and 5. Computational calculations demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of trioxa[9]circulene's saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic framework, while the other two compounds are rigid with large racemization barriers. Optically pure forms of 4 and 5 exhibit absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2, with smaller values observed for compound 4. In the crystal structures, molecules of 3 stack to form columns with remarkable &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap, and the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of 4 exhibit short intermolecular C&#8208;to&#8208;C contacts. Consequently, the solution&#8208;processed film of 4 functioned as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor in field effect transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Spiroaminals via Chiral Bifunctional Hydrogen Bonding Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiroaminals represent novel structural motifs prevalent in diverse natural products and biologically active molecules. Achieving their enantioselective synthesis is a highly desirable and challenging task in synthetic endeavors due to their intricate molecular frameworks. Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals using chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the possible stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance. Additionally, we validated the scalability of the reaction and demonstrated the synthesis of variable spiroaminal scaffolds, confirming the viability of our protocol.</dc:description>

Additionally, we validated the scalability of the reaction and demonstrated the synthesis of variable spiroaminal scaffolds, confirming the viability of our protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Distinguish MnO2/Mn2+ Conversion/ Zn2+ Intercalation/ H+ Conversion Chemistries at Different Potentials in Aqueous Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 chemistry has been extensively explored, but its electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in the context of MnO2/Mn2+ conversion and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, remain not fully understood. Here, we designed an amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte, which distinguished the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion, Zn2+ intercalation, and H+ intercalation and conversion processes at three distinct discharge plateaus of an aqueous Zn||MnO2 battery. The amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte is featured with an extended electrochemical stability window up to 3.0 V, high ionic conductivity, Zn2+&#8208;selective ion tunnels, and hydrophobic associations with cathode materials. This specifically designed electrolyte allows the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75 V. More interesting, the discharge plateaus of ~1.33 V, previously assigned as the co&#8208;intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ ions in the MnO2 cathode, are specified as the exclusive intercalation of Zn2+ ions, leading to an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau. Furthermore, with a distinct three&#8208;step electrochemical energy storage process, a high areal capacity of 1.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 and high specific energy of 0.858 Wh cm&#8208;2, even at a low MnO2 loading mass of 0.5 mg cm&#8208;2 are achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first report to fully distinguish different mechanisms at different potentials in aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities in Reactivating Inactive Lithium in Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The loss of active materials is one of the main culprits of the battery failures. As a typical example, the presence of inactive lithium, also known as &#8220;dead lithium&#8221;, contributes to the rapid capacity deterioration and reduces energy output in lithium batteries. This phenomenon has long been recognized as irreversible. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we aim to summarize the formation of inactive lithium and reassess its impact on battery performance metrics. Additionally, we explore various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. This comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in reactivating inactive lithium not only offers insights into restoring capacity and enhancing battery performance metrics but also provides a foundation for future research in reviving other inactive materials found in next&#8208;generation batteries, such as lithium metal, lithium&#8208;sulfur, silicon, and liquid flow batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks in Adsorption and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ion extraction and electro/photo catalysis are promising methods to address environmental and energy issues. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of promising template to construct absorbents and catalysts because of their stable frameworks, high surface areas, controllable pore environments, and well&#8208;defined catalytic sites. Among them, ionic COFs as unique class of crystalline porous materials, with charges in the frameworks or along the pore walls, have shown different properties and resulting performance in these applications with those from charge&#8208;neutral COFs. In this review, current research progress based on the ionic COFs for ion extraction and energy conversion, including cationic/anionic materials and electro/photo catalysis is reviewed in terms of the synthesis strategy, modification methods, mechanisms of adsorption and catalysis, as well as applications. Finally, we demonstrated the current challenges and future development of ionic COFs in design strategies and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8211;Cation Competition Chemistry for Comprehensive High&#8208;performance Prussian Blue Analogs Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extensively studied Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in various batteries are limited by their low discharge capacity, or subpar rate etc., which are solely reliant on the cation (de)intercalation mechanism. In contrast to the currently predominant focus on cations, we report the overlooked anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry (Cl&#8208;, K+, Zn2+) stimulated by high&#8208;voltage scanning. With our designed anion&#8208;cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &gt;2.0 V (vs. Zn/Zn2+), capacity &gt;150 mAh g&#8208;1, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96% from 0.6 to 5 A g&#8208;1, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000 cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance PBAs cathode batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal crRNA Acylation Strategy for Robust Photo&#8208;Initiated One&#8208;Pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a Nucleic Acid Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal regulation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is attractive for precise gene editing and accurate molecular diagnosis. Although many efforts have been made, versatile and efficient strategies to control CRISPR system are still desirable. Here, we proposed a universal and accessible acylation strategy to regulate the CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system by efficient acylation of 2'&#8208;hydroxyls (2'&#8208;OH) on crRNA strand with photolabile agents (PLGs). The introduction of PLGs confers efficient suppression of crRNA function and rapid restoration of CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a reaction upon short light exposure regardless of crRNA sequences. Based on this strategy, we constructed a universal PhotO&#8208;Initiated CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system for Robust One&#8208;pot Testing (POIROT) platform integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which showed two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional one&#8208;step assay and comparable to the two&#8208;step assay. For clinical sample testing, POIROT achieved high&#8208;efficiency detection performance comparable to the gold&#8208;standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) in sensitivity and specificity, but faster than the qPCR method. Overall, we believe the proposed strategy will promote the development of many other universal photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies for one&#8208;pot assay, and even expand applications in the fields of controllable CRISPR&#8208;based genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>The Importance of Sintering&#8208;Induced Grain Boundaries in Copper Catalysis to Improve Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Syngas conversion serves as a gas&#8208;to&#8208;liquid technology to produce liquid fuels and valuable chemicals from coal, natural gas, or biomass. During syngas conversion, sintering is known to deactivate the catalyst owing to the loss of active surface area. However, the growth of nanoparticles might induce the formation of new active sites such as grain boundaries (GBs) which perform differently from the original nanoparticles. Herein, we reported a unique Cu&#8208;based catalyst, Cu nanoparticles with in&#8208;situ&#160;generated GBs confined in zeolite Y (denoted as activated Cu/Y), which exhibited a high selectivity for C5+&#160;hydrocarbons (65.3 C%) during syngas conversion. Such high selectivity for long&#8208;chain products distinguished activated Cu/Y from typical copper&#8208;based catalysts which mainly catalyze methanol synthesis. This unique performance was attributed to the GBs, while the zeolite assisted the stabilization through spatial confinement. Specifically, the&#160;GBs enabled H&#8208;assisted dissociation of CO and subsequent hydrogenation into CHx*. CHx* species not only serve as the initiator but also directly polymerize on Cu GBs, known as the carbide mechanism. Meanwhile, the synergy of GBs and their vicinal low&#8208;index facets led to the CO insertion where non&#8208;dissociative adsorbed CO on low&#8208;index facets migrated to GBs and inserted into the metal&#8208;alkyl bond for the chain growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes&#8212;Formation and Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of &#951;5&#8208;alumole complexes of Ge(II) 3 is reported. The alumole complex 3 (R1=NCy2) is in equilibrium with its isomeric aluminylene germole complex 4. This equilibrium between aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes 3 and 4 marks an intriguing example for an exchange of two heteroatoms at the apical position of a pentagonal pyramidal structure under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The salt metathesis reaction of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediide with aluminum(III) dichlorides provides either half&#8208;sandwich alumole complexes of germanium(II) or aluminylene germole complexes. Their molecular structure and the delocalized bonding situation, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are equally described as isomeric aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes with either the germanium or the aluminum atom in the apical position of the pentagonal pyramid. The product formation and the selectivity of the reaction depends on the third substituent of the aluminum dichloride. Aryl&#8208;substituents favor the formation of alumole complexes and Cp*&#8208;substituents that of the isomeric germole complexes. With amino&#8208;substituents at the aluminum atom mixtures of both isomers are formed and the positional exchange of the two heteroatoms is shown by NMR spectroscopy. The alumole complexes of germanium(II) undergo facile reductive elimination of germanium and form the corresponding alumoles.

         <title>Boryl Ancillary Ligands: Influencing Stability and Reactivity of Amidinato&#8208;Silanone and Germanone Systems in Ammonia Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue) is formed from the corresponding tetrylene under an N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2).







Abstract
While the nucleophilic addition of ammonia to ketones is an archetypal reaction in classical organic chemistry, the reactivity of heavier group 14 carbonyl analogues (R2E=O; E=Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb) with NH3 remains sparsely investigated, primarily due to the synthetic difficulties in accessing heavier ketone congeners. Herein, we present a room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue), formed from the corresponding silylene under a N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2). Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the formation of this sila&#8208;hemiaminal is crucially dependent on the nature of the ancillary ligand scaffold. It is facilitated thermodynamically by the hemi&#8208;lability of the amidinate ligand (which allows for the formation of an energetically critical intramolecular N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HO hydrogen bond within the product) and is enabled mech&#8208;anistically by a process in which the silanone initially acts in umpolung fashion as a base (rather than an acid), due to the strongly electron&#8208;releasing and sterically bulky nature of the ancillary boryl ligand.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Fluorescent Polymer Dyes with Tunable Emission Spectra for Flow Cytometry Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of water&#8208;soluble fluorescent polymer dyes was developed. All &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are excited by a 405&#8197;nm laser, but are distinguishable by their emission spectra. The emission can be tuned by covalently binding of small&#8208;molecule dyes (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer). The dyes were bioconjugated to antibodies and used as reagents for multiparameter flow cytometric analysis.







Abstract
The application of spectrally unique, bright, and water&#8208;soluble fluorescent dyes is indispensable for the analysis of biological systems. Multiparameter flow cytometry is a powerful tool for characterization of mixed cell populations. To discriminate the different cell populations, they are typically stained by a set of fluorescent reagents, e.g., antibody&#8208;fluorophore conjugates. The number of parameters which can be studied simultaneously strongly depends on the availability of reagents which can be differentiated by their spectral properties. In this study a series of fluorescent polymer dyes was developed, that can be excited with a single violet laser (405&#8197;nm) but distinguished by their unique emission spectra. The polyfluorene&#8208;based polymers can be used on their own, or in combination with covalently bound small&#8208;molecule dyes to generate energy transfer constructs to red&#8208;shift the emission wavelength based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The polymer dyes were utilized in a biological flow cytometry assay by conjugating several of them to antibodies, demonstrating their effectiveness as reagents. This report represents the first systematic investigation of structure&#8211;property relationships for this type of fluorescent dyes.

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Chain Reptation Enhances Energy Dissipation of Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy dissipation of elastomers is precisely enhanced by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass.







Abstract
Vibrations with various frequencies in daily life and industry can cause health hazards and fatigue failure of critical structures, which requires the development of elastomers with high energy dissipation at desired frequencies. Current strategies relying on tuning characteristic relaxation time of polymer chains are mostly qualitative empirical methods, and it is difficult to precisely control damping performances. Here, we report a general strategy for constructing dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels that provide controllable ultrahigh energy dissipation. This is realized by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation of polymer fluids in a crosslinked network, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass. Using prototypical supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane elastomers, we demonstrate that dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels exhibit a controllable ultrahigh damping performance at desired frequencies (10&#8722;2~102&#8197;Hz), exceeding that of typical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicone damping materials. Their shock absorption is over 300&#8201;% higher than that of commercial silicone rubber under the same impact force.

         <title>Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics Reveals Insights into Cross&#8208;Coupling Mechanisms over Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for organic synthesis requires a deep understanding of active site architectures during surface&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our approach, combining in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and droplet&#8208;based microfluidics, investigates Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling over palladium single&#8208;atoms on carbon nitride. The results highlight the need for distinct design criteria compared to traditional homogeneously catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) hold promise as sustainable alternatives to metal complexes in organic transformations. However, their working structure and dynamics remain poorly understood, hindering advances in their design. Exploiting the unique features of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics, we present the first in&#8208;situ assessment of a palladium SAC based on exfoliated carbon nitride in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results confirm a surface&#8208;catalyzed mechanism, revealing the distinct electronic structure of active Pd centers compared to homogeneous systems, and providing insights into the stabilizing role of ligands and bases. This study establishes a valuable framework for advancing mechanistic understanding of organic syntheses catalyzed by SACs.

This study establishes a valuable framework for advancing mechanistic understanding of organic syntheses catalyzed by SACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Injection Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) Analysis of Proteins with High Matrix Content:Utilizing Taylor&#8211;Aris Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion was utilized for avoiding serious interferences occurring during the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of intact proteins without resorting to any pre&#8208;separation or sample purification techniques. The proposed method is applicable for the analysis of large components since their diffusion constants are very small compared to those of the other components in the sample.







Abstract
This is the first work demonstrating the utility of the Taylor&#8211;Aris (TA) dispersion in avoiding serious interference issues commonly occurring in the electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometric (ESI&#8208;MS) determination of therapeutic protein pharmaceuticals undergoing no pre&#8208;separation or sample purification. It was also pointed out that the TA dispersion conditions and its analytical utilization for proteomics can be easily accomplished in a commercial CE&#8208;MS instrument. In the proposed Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (TADA&#8208;MS) analysis 0.5&#8197;&#956;L sample is injected into a 65&#8197;cm long 50&#8197;&#956;m i.d. capillary and pumped with 1&#8197;bar toward the MS. The procedure is efficient for the direct injection analysis of components having low diffusion coefficients (proteins) that are present in complex matrices of small organic and inorganic compounds.

         <title>Bioinspired Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Click Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Medicinal Chemistry and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry is put forward based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. The reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and its broad applicability is demonstrated with examples of on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein modification.







Abstract
Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is modular, predictable, and high&#8208;yielding, features fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), excellent functional group compatibility, and works well at miniaturization (nanomole&#8208;scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo&#8208;Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx)), selenomacrocycle synthesis, nanomole&#8208;scale synthesis of Se&#8208;containing natural product library and DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL), late&#8208;stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry developments, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Isomerization of Indigo within 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced dehydrogenation of indigo on silver transforms its central double bond into a single bond, providing an unprecedented pathway for the previously restricted rotation of the indole moieties. On Ag(111), we realized 1D coordination polymers of (trans&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) which were thermally switched to (cis&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) polymers.







Abstract
Natural products are attractive components to tailor environmentally friendly advanced new materials. We present surface&#8208;confined metallosupramolecular engineering of coordination polymers using natural dyes as molecular building blocks: indigo and the related Tyrian purple. Both building blocks yield identical, well&#8208;defined coordination polymers composed of (1 dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;1 Fe) repeat units on two different silver single crystal surfaces. These polymers are characterized atomically by submolecular resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy, bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On Ag(100) and on Ag(111), the trans configuration of dehydroindigo results in N,O&#8208;chelation in the polymer chains. On the more inert Ag(111) surface, the molecules additionally undergo thermally induced isomerization from the trans to the cis configuration and afford N,N&#8208; plus O,O&#8208;chelation. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the coordination polymers of the cis&#8208;isomers on Ag(111) and of the trans&#8208;isomers on Ag(100) are energetically favoured. Our results demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic linker isomerization in interfacial metal&#8208;organic nanosystems.

         <title>The Photosalient Effect and Thermochromic Luminescence Based on o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Assisted &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Crystalline State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing the two fates of the formed excimer in the excited state, two distinctive stimuli responsiveness were obtained from the &#960;&#8208;stacking crystal structure of anthracene appended o&#8208;carborane derivatives. One is the dynamic motion initiated by UV light irradiation, called as photosalient effect. The other one is the thermochromic luminescence originated form the change of luminescent species.







Abstract
Herein, we report the unique multiple&#8208;stimuli responsiveness of anthracene&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carborane derivatives. We designed and synthesized anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions and numbers of the o&#8208;carborane units. Two compounds had characteristic crystal structures involving the columnar &#960;&#8208;stacking structures of the anthracene units. From the analysis of crystalline&#8208;state structure&#8211;property relationships, it was revealed that the crystals exhibited the photosalient effect accompanied by photochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reactions and temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical dual&#8208;emission properties including excimer emission of anthracene. Those properties were considered as non&#8208;radiative and radiative deactivation pathways through the excimer formation in the excited state and the formation of excimer species was facilitated by the &#960;&#8208;stacking structure of anthracene units. Moreover, we found unusual temperature dependency on the occurrence of the photosalient effect. According to the data from variable temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography, a strong correlation between lattice shrinkage and strain accumulation is suggested.

         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives was developed. The protocol utilizes a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides via desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride that can be further diversified to a diversity of N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds including amides, carbamates, ureas, thiocarbamates, and selenocarbamates with rich functionality.







Abstract
Fluorinated small molecules are commonly used in functional small&#8208;molecule chemistry, and N&#8208;difluoromethyl (N&#8208;CF2H) compounds are particularly intriguing due to their unique and unexplored physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, a general methodological approach to the synthesis of N&#8208;CF2H compounds remains elusive. Here, guided by computation, we present a simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives. The protocol involves a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides through desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride building blocks that can be further diversified to a variety of unexplored N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds with rich functionality. Additionally, preliminary studies on their properties and stability showcased their potential application in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrosynthesis of High Value&#8208;Added Active Chlorine Coupled with H2 Generation from Direct Seawater Electrolysis through Decoupling Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system is developed for energy&#8208;saving electrosynthesis of HClO and H2. This system requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared with direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V).







Abstract
Direct saline (seawater) electrolysis is a well&#8208;recognized system to generate active chlorine species for the chloride&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis, environmental remediation and sterilization over the past few decades. However, the large energy consumption originated from the high cell voltage of traditional direct saline electrolysis system, greatly restricts its practical application. Here, we report an acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system for energy&#8208;saving co&#8208;electrosynthesis of active chlorine and H2. We demonstrate that this system just requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared to direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V). We further demonstrate that such acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system could be extended to realize energy&#8208;saving and sustainable seawater electrolysis. The acidified seawater in this system can absolutely avoid the formation of Ca/Mg&#8208;based sediments that always form in the seawater electrolysis system. We also prove that this system in the half&#8208;flow mode can realize real&#8208;time preparation of active chlorine used for sterilization and pea sprout production.

         <title>Reductive Retrocyclization of a Mangana(II)cyclopentasilane to Form Manganese(0) Bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mangana(II)cyclopentasilanes were transformed into manganese(0) bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complexes via a retrocyclization induced by ligand exchange. An XPS analysis revealed the formation of a zero&#8208;valent manganese complex. The thermolysis of the bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complex in the presence of mesityl isocyanide led to the formation of a cyclotetrasilane via a formal dimerization of the two &#951;2&#8208;disilene moieties.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;exchange reactions on a mangana(II)cyclopentasilane complex that contains two THF ligands with aryl isocyanides led to the formation of manganese(0) bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complexes via a retrocyclization. In stark contrast, ligand&#8208;exchange reactions with CNtBu, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, or pyridine&#8208;based ligands furnished manganese(II) complexes wherein the manganacyclopentasilane framework remained intact. The thermolysis of the obtained bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complex in the presence of mesityl isocyanide led to the formation of a cyclotetrasilane via the formal dimerization of the two &#951;2&#8208;disilene moieties. The insertion of a mesityl isocyanide into the Mn&#8722;Si&#946; bond results in the formation of a manganese(II) complex supported by a [SiCSi]&#8208;type tridentate ligand scaffold.

Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry. This study presents borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. We show how the corresponding building blocks can be converted into borylated heterocycles. The regiochemistry of homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates was found to be related to the steric bulk of the diazo species.







Abstract
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry, including its pedagogy and applications. In this study, we present borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. A boron handle has been installed at either 
&#8208; or 
&#8208;position of acetoacetate by homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates. Either alkyl or boryl groups were found to migrate with regiochemistry being a function of the steric bulk of the diazo species. Boryl 
&#8208;ketoesters can be further modified into borylated pyrazolones and oximes, thereby expanding the synthetic toolkit and offering opportunities for additional modifications.

         <title>Electrooxidative Rhodium(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Sulfoximines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrooxidative rhodium(III)/chiral carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes, is described. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.







Abstract
The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8722;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er). The practicality of this method is demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.

&lt;p&gt;An electrooxidative rhodium(III)/chiral carboxylic acid-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes, is described. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2-benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox-neutral C&#8722;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8722;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2-benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er). The practicality of this method is demonstrated by scale-up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polar Aromatic Two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson Halide Perovskites for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with distinct spontaneous polarization (Ps) intensities were synthesized by incorporating isostructural aromatic diammoniums as spacers. Remarkably, due to the Ps&#8208;facilitated separation of the photogenerated carriers, polar 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI exhibit a 3.9&#8208; and 2.8&#8208;fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H2 evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3&#8208;APDPI.







Abstract
Polar materials with spontaneous polarization (Ps) have emerged as highly promising photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution owing to the Ps&#8208;enhanced photogenerated carrier separation. However, traditional inorganic polar materials often suffer from limitations such as wide band gaps and poor carrier transport, which hinders their photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency. Here, we rationally synthesized a series of isostructural two&#8208;dimensional (2D) aromatic Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites, namely (2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (2&#8208;APDPI), (3&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (3&#8208;APDPI), and (4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (4&#8208;APDPI), where 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI crystalize in polar space groups with piezoelectric constants (d33) of approximately 40&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1 and 3&#8208;APDPI adopts a centrosymmetric structure. Strikingly, owing to the Ps&#8208;facilitated separation of photogenerated carriers, polar 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI exhibit a 3.9&#8208; and 2.8&#8208;fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H2 evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3&#8208;APDPI. As a pioneering study, this work provides an efficient approach for exploring new polar photocatalysts and highlights their potential in promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution.

         <title>Designing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Membranes for Isomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To well separate pairs of hydrocarbon isomers, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed. Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 membranes are fabricated for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes with middle pore size are constructed for n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation. Additionally, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smallest pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based separation has the merit of low carbon footprint. In this study, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed for discriminating various pairs of hydrocarbon isomers. Specifically, Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo) membranes are developed for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. For n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation, the functional groups and proportion of the ligands in UiO&#8208;66 are gradually adjusted to effectively regulate the pore size, and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes are constructed. In addition, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smaller pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.

         <title>Prolinyl Phosphoramidates of Nucleotides with Increased Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prolinyl nucleotides with increased reactivity were created by introducing additional substituents to the prolinyl ring. Both alkyl and carboxyl groups increase the rate of nucleotide release and enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying, demonstrating how powerful prolines are as leaving groups.







Abstract
Nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) are the subunits of RNA. They are incorporated into growing complementary strands when sequences are copied in enzyme&#8208;free reactions using organic leaving groups at the phosphates. Amino acids are rarely considered as leaving groups, but proline can act as a leaving group when N&#8208;linked to NMPs, so that prolinyl NMPs hydrolyze in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, with half&#8208;life times as short as 2.4&#8197;h, and they act as monomers in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Still, their level of reactivity is insufficient for practical purposes, requiring months for some extensions. Herein we report the synthesis of eight substituted prolinyl AMPs together with seven related compounds and the results of a study of their reactivity. A &#948;&#8208;carboxy prolinyl NMP was found to be converted with a half&#8208;life time of just 11&#8197;min in magnesium&#8208;free buffer, and a &#948;&#8208;isopropyl prolinyl NMP was shown to react sevenfold faster than its prolinyl counterpart in enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. Our results indicate that both anchimeric and steric effects can be employed to increase the reactivity of aminoacidyl nucleotides, i.e. compounds that combine two fundamental classes of biomolecules in one functional entity.

         <title>De Novo Designed Ru(II) Metallacycle as a Microenvironment&#8208;Adaptive Sonosensitizer and Sonocatalyst for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Biofilms Eradication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy is proposed to boost the reactive oxygen species&#8208;generation capability, resulting in the development of the first example of a supramolecular sonosensitizer (Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD). Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD effectively overcame challenges posed by the complex biofilm microenvironment, including hypoxia, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and hypopermeability for amplifying sonotherapeutic efficacy in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant biofilms.







Abstract
Albeit sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has achieved encouraging progress in microbial sterilization, the scarcity of guidelines for designing highly effective sonosensitizers and the intricate biofilm microenvironment (BME), substantially hamper the therapeutic efficacy against biofilm infections. To address the bottlenecks, we innovatively design a Ru(II) metallacycle&#8208;based sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst (named Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD) to enhance the potency of sonotherapy by employing molecular engineering strategies tailored to BME. Our approach involves augmenting Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD&#8217;s production of ultrasonic&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS), surpassing the performance of commercial sonosensitizers, through a straightforward but potent &#960;&#8208;expansion approach. Within the BME, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD synergistically amplifies sonotherapeutic efficacy via triple&#8208;modulated approaches: (i) effective alleviation of hypoxia, leading to increased ROS generation, (ii) disruption of the antioxidant defense system, which shields ROS from glutathione consumption, and (iii) enhanced biofilm penetration, enabling ROS production in deep sites. Notably, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD sono&#8208;catalytically oxidizes NADPH, a critical coenzyme involved in antioxidant defenses. Consequently, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD demonstrates superior biofilm eradication potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli compared to conventional clinical antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering instance of a supramolecular sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst. It provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship of sonosensitizers and paves a promising pathway for the treatment of biofilm infections.

&lt;p&gt;Albeit sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has achieved encouraging progress in microbial sterilization, the scarcity of guidelines for designing highly effective sonosensitizers and the intricate biofilm microenvironment (BME), substantially hamper the therapeutic efficacy against biofilm infections. To address the bottlenecks, we innovatively design a Ru(II) metallacycle-based sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst (named &lt;b&gt;Ru-A3-TTD&lt;/b&gt;) to enhance the potency of sonotherapy by employing molecular engineering strategies tailored to BME. Our approach involves augmenting &lt;b&gt;Ru-A3-TTD&lt;/b&gt;&#8217;s production of ultrasonic-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS), surpassing the performance of commercial sonosensitizers, through a straightforward but potent &#960;-expansion approach. Within the BME, &lt;b&gt;Ru-A3-TTD&lt;/b&gt; synergistically amplifies sonotherapeutic efficacy via triple-modulated approaches: (i) effective alleviation of hypoxia, leading to increased ROS generation, (ii) disruption of the antioxidant defense system, which shields ROS from glutathione consumption, and (iii) enhanced biofilm penetration, enabling ROS production in deep sites. Notably, &lt;b&gt;Ru-A3-TTD&lt;/b&gt; sono-catalytically oxidizes NADPH, a critical coenzyme involved in antioxidant defenses. Consequently, &lt;b&gt;Ru-A3-TTD&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates superior biofilm eradication potency against multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; compared to conventional clinical antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering instance of a supramolecular sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst. It provides valuable insights into the structure-activity relationship of sonosensitizers and paves a promising pathway for the treatment of biofilm infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Robust MOF for Challenging Ethylene Purification and Propylene Recovery with Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

Nonpolar pore environments with N/O active sites in a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) are generated for ethylene purification and propylene recovery. The material exhibits the good balance between excellent separation performance, facile scale synthesis, economic feasibility and high stability for applications.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) purification and propylene (C3H6) recovery are highly relevant in polymer synthesis, yet developing physisorbents for these industrial separation faces the challenges of merging easy scalability, economic feasibility, high moisture stability with great separation efficiency. Herein, we reported a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) for simultaneous recovery of C3H6 and C2H4. Through creating nonpolar pores decorated by accessible N/O sites, MAC&#8208;4 displays top&#8208;tier uptakes and selectivities for C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4 at ambient conditions. Molecular modelling combined with infrared spectroscopy revealed that C2H6 and C3H6 molecules were trapped in the framework with stronger contacts relative to C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated exceptional separation performance for binary C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 as well as ternary C3H6/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, simultaneously affording record productivities of 27.4 and 36.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) and C3H6 (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%). MAC&#8208;4 was facilely prepared at deckgram&#8208;scale under reflux condition within 3&#8197;hours, making it as a smart MOF to address challenging gas separations.

         <title>Confinement of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals into Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore Zeolite for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) was used as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for boosting photocatalytic HI splitting. The superior activity of the composite was the result of exposed active sites, excellent I3&#8722; adsorption and facile molecular/ionic transfer and diffusion, suitable band gap, as well as good stability.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs), renowned for their outstanding optoelectronic properties, hold significant promise as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the low stability and insufficient exposure of catalytically active sites of bulky MHPs seriously impair their catalytic efficiency. Herein, we utilized an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (3.4&#8197;nm) for boosting hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting. The as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 featured sufficiently exposed active sites, superior stability in acidic media, along with intrinsic extra&#8208;large pores of ZEO&#8208;1 that were favorable for molecule/ion adsorption and diffusion. Most importantly, the unique nanoconfinement effect of ZEO&#8208;1 led to the narrowing of the band gap of CsPbBr3, allowing for more efficient light utilization. As a result, the photocatalytic HER rate of the as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 photocatalyst was increased to 1734&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3) under visible light irradiation compared with bulk CsPbBr3 (11&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), and the long&#8208;term durability (36&#8197;h) can be achieved. Furthermore, Pt was incorporated with well&#8208;dispersed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into ZEO&#8208;1, resulting in a significant enhancement in activity (4826&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), surpassing most of the Pt&#8208;integrated perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics investigation revealed that the dramatically boosted photocatalytic performance of Pt/CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 could be attributed to the promotion of charge separation and transfer, as well as to the substantially lowered energy barrier for HER. This work highlights the advantage of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites as the nanoscale platform to accommodate multiple photoactive components, opening up promising prospects in the design and exploitation of novel zeolite&#8208;confined photocatalysts for energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>A Microporous Multi&#8208;Cage Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for an Effective One&#8208;Step Separation of Branched Alkanes Feeds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of C5/C6 alkane isomers for octane upgrading of gasoline was achieved for the first time by one single material, an unprecedented scalable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Fe trimers and pyrazole&#8208;carboxylate ligands with a multi&#8208;cage structure with flu&#8208;e topology.







Abstract
The improvement of the Total Isomerization Process (TIP) for the production of high&#8208;quality gasoline with the ultimate goal of reaching a Research Octane Number (RON) higher than 92 requires the use of specific sorbents to separate pentane and hexane isomers into classes of linear, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;branched isomers. Herein we report the design of a new multi&#8208;cage microporous Fe(III)&#8208;MOF (referred to as MIP&#8208;214, MIP stands for materials of the Institute of Porous Materials of Paris) with a flu&#8208;e topology, incorporating an asymmetric heterofunctional ditopic ligand, 4&#8208;pyrazolecarboxylic acid, that exhibits an appropriate microporous structure for a thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of hydrocarbon isomers. This MOF produced via a direct, scalable, and mild synthesis route was proven to encompass a unique separation of C5/C6 isomers by classes of low RON over high RON alkanes with a sorption hierarchy: (n&#8208;hexane&#8811;n&#8208;pentane&#8776;2&#8208;methylpentane&gt;3&#8208;methylpentane)low RON&#8811;(2,3&#8208;dimethylbutane&#8776;i&#8208;pentane&#8776;2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane)high RON following the adsorption enthalpy sequence. We reveal for the first time that a single sorbent can efficiently separate such a complex mixture of high RON di&#8208;branched hexane and mono&#8208;branched pentane isomers from their low RON counterparts, which is a major achievement reported so far.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt in Molecular Catalysts via Coordination Environment Regulation for Highly Efficient Heterogeneous Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic molecular catalysts with different coordination environments were synthesized to enhance electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) for efficient ammonia (NH3) production. The best catalyst with N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration exhibited superior activity, achieving over 94&#8201;% NH3 Faradaic efficiency. The research highlights the impact of coordinating subunits on the electronic structures and activity towards eNO3RR and establishes a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is pivotal in modern industry and represents a promising next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy carrier. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) presents viable solutions for NH3 production and removal of ambient nitrate pollutants. However, the development of eNO3RR is hindered by lacking the efficient electrocatalysts. To address this challenge, we synthesized a series of macrocyclic molecular catalysts for the heterogeneous eNO3RR. These materials possess different coordination environments around metal centers by surrounding subunits. Consequently, electronic structures of the active centers can be altered, enabling tunable activity towards eNO3RR. Our investigation reveals that metal center with an N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration demonstrates superior activity over the others and achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 90&#8201;% within the tested range, where the highest FE of approximately 94&#8201;% is obtained. Furthermore, it achieves a production rate of 11.28&#8197;mg&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a turnover frequency of up to 3.28&#8197;s&#8722;1. Further tests disclose that these molecular catalysts with diverse coordination environments showed different magnetic moments. Theoretical calculation results indicate that variated coordination environments can result in a d&#8208;band center variation which eventually affects rate&#8208;determining step energy and calculated magnetic moments, thus establishing a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.

         <title>Regulating the Layered Stacking of a Covalent Triazine Framework Membrane for Aromatic/Aliphatic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing non&#8208;planar monomers to regulate the interlayer stacking of covalent triazine framework (CTF) membranes formed by planar monomers, we can exert effective control over the pore size in the staggered stacking structure of CTF membrane. Through the coordinated adjustment of stacking space and pore surface properties, the effective separation of aromatic/aliphatic organic mixtures in all&#8208;liquid phase has been successfully realized.







Abstract
Membrane separation of aromatics and aliphatics is a crucial requirement in chemical and petroleum industries. However, this task presents a significant challenge due to the lack of membrane materials that can endure harsh solvents, exhibit molecular specificity, and facilitate easy processing. Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate a covalent triazine framework (CTF) membrane by employing a mix&#8208;monomer strategy. By incorporating a spatial monomer alongside a planar monomer, we were able to subtly modulate both the pore aperture and membrane affinity, enabling preferential permeation of aromatics over aliphatics with molecular weight below 200&#8197;Dalton (Da). Consequently, we achieved successful all&#8208;liquid phase separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. Our investigation revealed that the synergistic effects of size sieving and the affinity between the permeating molecules and the membrane played a pivotal role in separating these closely resembling species. Furthermore, the membrane exhibited remarkable robustness under practical operating conditions, including prolonged operation time, various feed compositions, different applied pressure, and multiple feed components. This versatile strategy offers a feasible approach to fabricate membranes with molecule selectivity toward aromatic/aliphatic mixtures, taking a significant step forward in addressing the grand challenge of separating small organic molecules through membrane technology.

         <title>Flexible Organic Chiral Crystals with Thermal and Excitation Modulation of the Emission for Information Transmission, Writing, and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible crystals of chiral enantiomers have been found to be capable of a fast, reversible, highly robust, and fatigueless photoresponse that can be modulated by both the intensity of excitation light and temperature. Combining the advantages of chiral signals, multiple responses, and writability by UV light, they hold potential for a wide range of applications, such as on&#8208;demand information transfer, storage, and cryptographic displays.







Abstract
Organic single crystals quickly emerge as dense yet light and nearly defect&#8208;free media for emissive elements. Integration of functionalities and control over the emissive properties is currently being explored for a wide range of these materials to benchmark their performance against organic emissive materials diluted in powders or films. Here, we report mechanically flexible emissive chiral organic crystals capable of an unprecedented combination of fast, reversible, and low&#8208;fatigue responses. UV&#8208;excited single crystals of both enantiomers of the material, 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(((1&#8208;phenylidene)imino)methyl)phenol, exhibit a drastic yet reversible change in the emission color from green to orange&#8208;yellow within a second and can be cycled at least 2000&#8197;times. The photoresponse was found to depend strongly on the excitation intensity and temperature. Combining chirality, mechanical compliance, rapid emission switching, multiple responses, and writability by UV light, this material provides a unique and versatile platform for developing organic crystal&#8208;based materials for on&#8208;demand signal transfer, information storage, and cryptography.

         <title>Custom&#8208;Design of Strong Electron/Proton Extractor on COFs for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We custom&#8208;designed a strong electron/proton extractor on COFs by introducing oxygen functional groups (&#8722;COOH and &#8722;SO3H) in high&#8208;crystalline triazine&#8208;containing COFs, which induces well&#8208;oriented build&#8208;in electron field and enhances the hydrophilicity, leading to fast proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process and enhanced O2 adsorption, and therefore boosted photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion.







Abstract
The development of photocatalysts with continuous electron extraction and rapid proton transfer could kinetically accelerate the artificial photosynthesis, but remains a challenge. Herein, we report the topology&#8208;guided synthesis of a high&#8208;crystalline triazine covalent organic framework (COF) decorated by uniformly distributed polar oxygen functional groups (sulfonic group or carboxyl) as the strong electron/proton extractor for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. It was found that the polarity&#8208;based proton transfer as well as electron enrichment in as&#8208;obtained COFs played a crucial role in improving the H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency (i.e., with an activity order of sulfonic acid&#8208; (SO3H&#8208;COF)&gt;carboxyl&#8208; (COOH&#8208;COF)&gt;hydrogen&#8208; (H&#8208;COF) functionalized COFs). The strong polar sulfonic acid group in the high&#8208;crystalline SO3H&#8208;COF triggered a well&#8208;oriented built&#8208;in electric field and more hydrophilic surface, which serves as an efficient carrier extractor enabling a continuous transportation of the photogenerated electrons and interfacial proton to the active sites (i.e., C atoms linked to &#8722;SO3H group). As&#8208;accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), together with the stabilized O2 adsorption finally leads to the highest H2O2 production rate of 4971&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, a quantum yield of 15&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm is obtained, superior to most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Organic Polymer as Multifunctional Interfacial Layers for Ultra&#8208;Long Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial layer with external micromagnetic field, Co&#8208;coordinated sp&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated organic polymer (denoted as Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP), is demonstrated to regulate the Li+ relative local environment and induce uniform Li deposition. The unique synergistic beneficial effect of organic functional groups (C&#8801;C linkage, C=N units and aromatic rings) and the Co sites and their underlying working mechanism are revealed.







Abstract
Fatal issues in lithium metal anodes (LMA), such as detrimental lithium dendrites growth and fragile solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the Li plating/stripping process, often hinder the practical application of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, cobalt&#8208;coordinated sp&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated organic polymer (Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP) is constructed as the protective layer for regulating the interface stability of LMA. The unique synergistic beneficial effect of organic functional groups (C&#8801;C linkage, C=N units and aromatic rings) and Co sites not only regulate the Li+ coordination environment and rearrange Li+ concentration to facilitate its transport by optimizing the electronic density, enhancing the compatibility with electrolyte interface and supplying &#8220;external magnetic driving strategy&#8221;, but also strengthens the interfacial stiffness with high Young's modulus to better withstand the mechanical stress. These beneficial effects and relative underlying working mode and mechanism of uniform Li plating and rapid Li+ migration on the Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP are also revealed by various in situ/ex situ experimental technologies and theory calculation. The Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP&#8208;based cell delivers an extraordinary lifespan of 6600&#8197;h and ultrahigh capacity retention of 78.3&#8201;% (111.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This demonstrated synergistic strategy in Co&#8208;coordinated organic polymer may gain new insights to regulate the uniform and non&#8208;dendritic deposition/dissolution behaviors for highly stable LMBs.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Hollow Nanoporous Carbon Architectures by Controlling MOF Crystalline Inhomogeneity for Ultra&#8208;Stable Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is for the first time found that single&#8208;component MOFs (STU&#8208;1) crystals with inner crystalline inhomogeneity could enable the facile and versatile syntheses of hollow nanoporous carbon architectures (HNCs) through an unexplored spontaneous hollowing mechanism. The obtain HNCs can act as a high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable anode for Na&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Hollow nanoporous carbon architectures (HNCs) present significant utilitarian value for a wide variety of applications. Facile and efficient preparation of HNCs has long been pursued but still remains challenging. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate that single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals, rather than the widely reported hybrid ones which necessitate tedious operations for preparation, could enable the facile and versatile syntheses of functional HNCs. By controlling the growth kinetics, the MOFs crystals (STU&#8208;1) are readily engineered into different shapes with designated styles of crystalline inhomogeneity. A subsequent one&#8208;step pyrolysis of these MOFs with intraparticle difference can induce a simultaneous self&#8208;hollowing and carbonization process, thereby producing various functional HNCs including yolk&#8208;shell polyhedrons, hollow microspheres, mesoporous architectures, and superstructures. Superior to the existing methods, this synthetic strategy relies only on the complex nature of single&#8208;component MOFs crystals without involving tedious operations like coating, etching, or ligand exchange, making it convenient, efficient, and easy to scale up. An ultra&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion battery anode is demonstrated by the HNCs with extraordinary cyclability (93&#8201;% capacity retention over 8000 cycles), highlighting a high level of functionality of the HNCs.

         <title>Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Manipulating the Intermolecular Interactions through Side Chain Fluorine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of precisely controlled fluorine atoms into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series non&#8208;fullerene acceptors substantially increased the overall average electrostatic potential and charge balance factor. This enhancement improved intermolecular interaction, allowing for precise tuning of molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Consequently, BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Fluorine side chain functionalization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) represents an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, a knowledge gap persists regarding the relationship between structural changes induced by fluorine functionalization and the resultant impact on device performance. In this work, varying amounts of fluorine atoms were introduced into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs to construct two acceptors named BTP&#8208;F0 and BTP&#8208;F5. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that side&#8208;chain fluorination significantly increase the overall average electrostatic potential (ESP) and charge balance factor, thereby effectively improving the ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular electrostatic interaction, and thus precisely tuning the molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Therefore, the BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based OSC exhibited enhanced crystallinity, domain purity, reduced domain spacing, and optimized phase distribution in the vertical direction. This facilitates exciton diffusion, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. Consequently, the promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;% were achieved in BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices, respectively, surpassing the PCE of 16.1&#8201;% for BTP&#8208;F0&#8208;based OSCs. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and demonstrates that fluorine functionalization of the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs is a compelling strategy for achieving ideal phase separation for highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Dynamically Ion&#8208;Coordinated Bipolar Organodichalcogenide Cathodes Enabling High&#8208;Energy and Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new b&#8208;type phenyl diselenide cathode with self&#8208;healing diselenide bond active site is developed, showing evident superiority to conventional b&#8208;type organic cathodes with organic active groups in terms of redox potential and reversible capacity. During charge/discharge processes, the diselenide bond is periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with cation/anion charge carriers, enabling a high&#8208;energy and durable aqueous Zn battery.







Abstract
Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high&#8208;energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high&#8208;voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion&#8208;coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe&#8208;SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)&#8722; to (PhSe&#8208;SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF&#8722;). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK&#8208;3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK&#8208;3&#8201;||&#8201;Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPDSe&#8722;1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4&#8197;V), high energy density (578.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgPDSe&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (12&#8201;000 cycles) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion&#8208;type active site engineering for high&#8208;voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high&#8208;energy AZBs.

         <title>Negatively Curved Octagon&#8208;Incorporated Aza&#8208;nanographene and its Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

A regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure has led to the synthesis of a negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene containing two octagons, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron&#8208;rich nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of the saddle&#8208;shaped structure lead to intriguing photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as tight association with fullerenes (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60 and Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70).







Abstract
A negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene (NG) containing two octagons was synthesized by a regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure, in which a double aza[7]helicene was simultaneously formed as an intermediate. Their saddle&#8208;shaped structures with negative curvature were unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, thereby enabling the exploration of the structure&#8211;property relationship by photophysical, electrochemical and conformational studies. Moreover, the assembly of the octagon&#8208;embedded aza&#8208;NG with fullerenes was probed by fluorescence spectral titration, with record&#8208;high binding constants (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60, Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70) found among reported negatively curved polycyclic aromatic compounds. The tight association of aza&#8208;NG with C60 was further elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of their co&#8208;crystal, which showed the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with substantial concave&#8208;convex interactions.

         <title>Controlling the Phase Transformation of Alumina for Enhanced Stability and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter.







Abstract
Current transition alumina catalysts require the presence of significant amounts of toxic, environmentally deleterious dopants for their stabilization. Herein, we report a simple and novel strategy to engineer transition aluminas to withstand aging temperatures up to 1200&#8201;&#176;C without inducing the transformation to low&#8208;surface&#8208;area &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and without requiring dopants. By judiciously optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter. These specific surface sites provide favorable interactions with supported metal catalysts, leading to improved metal dispersion and greatly enhanced catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation. The results presented herein not only provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the critical factors causing deactivation and phase transformation of aluminas but also pave the way for the development of catalysts with improved activity for catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Doped CuPd Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Nanotetrahedrons for Ethylene Glycol Oxidation Electrocatalysis: Enhanced Selective Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) were facilely prepared through an aqueous surfactant&#8208;templating epitaxial growth strategy. With mesoporous channels and multi&#8208;compositions, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs delivered remarkable C&#8722;C bond cleavage of electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation (EGOR) to C1 products. The Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed perfectly in coupled electrocatalysis of EGOR and nitrate reduction.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells is of decisive importance to hold higher energy efficiency. Despite some achievements, their progress, especially electrocatalytic selectivity to complete oxidated C1 products, is remarkably slower than expected. In this work, we developed a facile aqueous synthesis of Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for promoting oxidation cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in alkaline EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) electrocatalysis. The synthesis relied on precise reduction/co&#8208;nucleation and epitaxial growth of Ir, Cu and Pd precursors with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra Br&#8722; as the facet&#8208;selective agent under ambient conditions. The products featured concave nanotetrahedron morphology enclosed by well&#8208;defined (111) facets, single&#8208;crystalline and mesoporous structure radiated from the center, and uniform elemental composition without any phase separation. Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs disclosed remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability as well as superior selectivity of C1 products for alkaline EGOR electrocatalysis. Detailed mechanism studies demonstrated that performance improvement came from structural and compositional synergies, which kinetically accelerated transports of electrons/reactants within active sites of penetrated mesopores and facilitated oxidation cleavage of high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier C&#8722;C bond of EG for desired C1 products. More interestingly, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed well in coupled electrocatalysis of anode EGOR and cathode nitrate reduction, highlighting its high potential as bifunctional electrocatalyst in various applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of C&#8722;SCF3 Stereocenters via Nickel Catalyzed Asymmetric Negishi Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of chiral SRf (SCF3, SC2F5, SC3F7, SC4F9 and SCF2CO2Et)&#8208;containing 1,1&#8208;diaryl tertiary carbon centers with high enantioselectivities was developed by a nickel catalyzed asymmetric Negishi coupling reaction. The synthetic utility of this strategy was demonstrated in a gram scale reaction and the syntheses of optical analogues of bioactive compounds by introducing SCF3 groups without an apparent decrease in enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of the SCF3&#8208;containing 1,1&#8208;diaryl tertiary carbon stereocenters with high enantioselectivities is reported via a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling strategy. This method demonstrates simple operations, mild conditions and excellent functional group tolerance, with newly designed SCF3&#8208;containing synthon, which can be easily obtained from commercially available benzyl bromide and trifluoromethylthio anion in a two&#8208;step manner. Further substrate exploration indicated that the reaction system could be extended to diverse perfluoroalkyl sulfide (SC2F5, SC3F7, SC4F9, SCF2CO2Et)&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this transformation was further demonstrated by convenient derivatization to optical SCF3&#8208;containing analogues of bioactive compounds without an apparent decrease in enantioselectivity.

         <title>Diboraperylene Diborinic Acid Self&#8208;Assembly on Ag(111)&#8212;Kagome Flat Band Localized States Imaged by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
A planar diboraperylene diborinic acid B2&#8722;Per self&#8208;assembles into a chiral kagome supramolecular network on an Ag(111) substrate and is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between BOH subunits of adjacent molecules. The kagome supramolecular network exhibits a dispersionless flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level, which is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and further proved by tight&#8208;binding model calculations.







Abstract
Replacement of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by boron affords electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;scaffolds due to the vacant pz&#8208;orbital of three&#8208;coordinate boron with the potential for pronounced electronic interactions with electron&#8208;rich metal surfaces. Using a diboraperylene diborinic acid derivative as precursor and a controlled on&#8208;surface non&#8208;covalent synthesis approach, we report on a self&#8208;assembled chiral supramolecular kagome network on an Ag(111) surface stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions at low temperature. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) reveal a flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level which is localized at the molecule center, in good agreement with tight&#8208;binding model calculations of flat bands characteristic for kagome lattices.

         <title>The Construction of Anion&#8208;Induced Solvation Structures in Low&#8208;concentration Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte was designed, where the CIPs and SSHIPs were achieved at low concentration by the coordination of PCA&#8722; with Zn2+ and bonding with solvated H2O molecules. This electrolyte effectively inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions on Zn anodes even at low concentration.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices because of their low cost and high safety. However, owing to the high activity of H2O molecules in electrolytes, hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions usually take place on Zn anodes. Herein, additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte with capacity of suppressing the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules was designed by selecting the cationophilic and solventophilic anions. In such electrolyte, contact ion&#8208;pairs and solvent&#8208;shared ion&#8208;pairs were achieved even at low concentration, where PCA&#8722; anions coordinate with Zn2+ and bond with solvated H2O molecules. Simultaneously, PCA&#8722; anions also induce the construction of H&#8208;bonds between free H2O molecules and them. Therefore, the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules is effectively restrained. Furthermore, since PCA&#8722; anions possess a strong affinity with metal Zn, they can also adsorb on Zn anode surface to protect Zn anode from the direct contact of H2O molecules, inhibiting the occurrence of water&#8208;triggered side reactions. As a result, plating/stripping behavior of Zn anodes is highly reversible and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.43&#8201;% in PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte. To illustrate the feasibility of PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte, the Zn||PANI full batteries were assembled based on PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>Transient Metallo&#8208;Lipidoid Assemblies Amplify Covalent Catalysis of Aqueous and Non&#8208;Aqueous Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient metallo&#8208;lipidoid supramolecular assembly is constructed utilizing a ligand L1 and a tetracoordinate chelating agent NTA&#8208;R. The self&#8208;assembled vesicular structures upregulate the catalysis of both aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous chemical reactions. The metal ions facilitate transient activation of the assembly, thereby enabling temporal control of the catalytic chemical reactions.







Abstract
Dissipative supramolecular assemblies are hallmarks of living systems, contributing to their complex, dynamic structures and emerging functions. Living cells can spatiotemporally control diverse biochemical reactions in membrane compartments and condensates, regulating metabolite levels, signal transduction or remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Herein, we constructed membranous compartments using self&#8208;assembly of lipid&#8208;like amphiphiles (lipidoid) in aqueous medium. The new double&#8208;tailed lipidoid features Cu(II) coordinated with a tetravalent chelator that dictates the binding of two amphiphilic ligands in cis&#8208;orientation. Hydrophobic interactions between the lipidoids coupled with intermolecular hydrogen bonding led to a well&#8208;defined bilayer vesicle structure. Oil&#8208;soluble SNAr reaction is efficiently upregulated in the hydrophobic cavity, acting as a catalytic crucible. The modular system allows easy incorporation of exposed primary amine groups, which augments the catalysis of retro aldol and C&#8722;N bond formation reactions. Moreover, a higher&#8208;affinity chelator enables consumption of the Cu(II) template leveraging the differential thermodynamic stability, which allows a controllable lifetime of the vesicular assemblies. Concomitant temporal upregulation of the catalytic reactions could be tuned by the metal ion concentration. This work offers new possibilities for metal ion&#8208;mediated dynamic supramolecular systems, opening up a massive repertoire of functionally active dynamic &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; materials.

         <title>Backbone Engineering of Polymeric Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Reduction in Bipolar Membrane Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>

         <dc:description>
Bipolar membranes (BPMs) can mitigate CO2 losses and salt precipitation during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the performance is poor due to the local acidic environment. We report a backbone engineering strategy to improve the performance of molecular catalysts in BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, achieving a high selectivity of 82.6&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA/cm2, a high CO2 utilization efficiency of 87.8&#8201;%, and the least energy consumption (957&#8197;kJ/mol).







Abstract
Bipolar membranes (BPMs) have emerged as a promising solution for mitigating CO2 losses, salt precipitation and high maintenance costs associated with the commonly used anion&#8208;exchange membrane electrode assembly for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the industrial implementation of BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer is hampered by the poor CO2RR performance, largely attributed to the local acidic environment. Here, we report a backbone engineering strategy to improve the CO2RR performance of molecular catalysts in BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers by covalently grafting cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine onto a positively charged polyfluorene backbone (PF&#8208;CoTAPc). PF&#8208;CoTAPc shows a high acid tolerance in BPM electrode assembly (BPMEA), achieving a high FE of 82.6&#8201;% for CO at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 and a high CO2 utilization efficiency of 87.8&#8201;%. Notably, the CO2RR selectivity, carbon utilization efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of PF&#8208;CoTAPc in BPMEA outperform reported BPM systems. We attribute the enhancement to the stable cationic shield in the double layer and suppression of proton migration, ultimately inhibiting the undesired hydrogen evolution and improving the CO2RR selectivity. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the least energy consumption (957&#8197;kJ/mol) for the PF&#8208;CoTAPc catalyst in BPMEA. Our findings provide a viable strategy for designing efficient CO2RR catalysts in acidic environments.

         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for Ni2+ substitution of Co2+ to develop an oxide heterostructure on (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) for highly efficient electroreduction nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), where Ni plays a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary sites for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.







Abstract
Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8722; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8722;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.42&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO3&#8722;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH3 evolution.

         <title>Cooperation of Different Active Sites to Promote CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst with three distinct catalytic sites was prepared by doping Pd atoms onto a Cu catalyst, which exhibited high activity for C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The introduced Pd atom is an active site, which can promote the H2O dissociation. The Cu atoms near the Pd atom are another catalytic site, which can enhance the CO conversion. In contrast, the Cu atoms far from the Pd atom are active sites for the CO2 activation.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products provides a promising strategy for reaching the goal of carbon neutrality. However, achieving high selectivity of C2+ products at high current density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and prepared a multi&#8208;sites catalyst, in which Pd was atomically dispersed in Cu (Pd&#8722;Cu). It was found that the Pd&#8722;Cu catalyst had excellent performance for producing C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could be maintained at approximately 80.8&#8201;%, even at a high current density of 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for at least 20&#8197;hours. In addition, the FE of C2+ products was above 70&#8201;% at 1.4&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the catalyst had three distinct catalytic sites. These three active sites allowed for efficient conversion of CO2, water dissociation, and CO conversion, ultimately leading to high yields of C2+ products.

         <title>Coherent Modulation of the Aggregation Behavior and Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Small Molecule Probes for Sensitive and Long&#8208;term Nerve Agent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fully modulating the ICT degree and the AIE property of the solid&#8208;state probes, a colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection strategy is built with boosted response contrast for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP. The proposed probe design strategy would help to open a door for exploring novel probe design methodologies from the aspect of synergistically modulating the molecular structure and the emission behavior.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) shows promising performance in chemical sensing relying on the change of the emission behavior of the probe molecule monomers to the aggregated product. However, whether the response contrast could be further boosted by utilizing the emission property of the aggregated probe and the aggregated product remains a big challenge. Here, an exciting AIE probe regulation strategy was proposed by coherently modulating the aggregation behavior and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) property of the probes and thus an aggregated&#8208;to&#8208;aggregated colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection was achieved. The blue emissive film obtained with the optimal AIE probe has been proven to be effective to recognize the vapor of nerve agent analog DCP in air by emitting a sharp green fluorescence. In addition, a porous polymer&#8208;based wet sensing chip loaded with the probe enables the immediate response to DCP vapor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7&#8197;ppb, and it was further integrated into a wearable watch device for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP vapor up to two weeks. We expect the present probe design strategy would greatly deepen the AIE&#8208;based science and provide new insights for long&#8208;term monitoring sensors toward trace hazardous substances.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, we introduced a chiral amine during the imine formation process. Addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde formed a trisimino intermediate. The chiral intermediate was then combined with achiral trisamino precursor. Imine exchange reaction led to release of the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 75&#8201;%, which is composed of achiral building precursors exclusively.







Abstract
How Nature synthesizes enantiomerically pure substances from achiral or racemic resources remains a mystery. In this study, we aimed to emulate this natural phenomenon by constructing chiral tetrahedral cages through self&#8208;assembly, achieved by condensing two achiral compounds&#8211;a trisamine and a trisaldehyde. The occurrence of intercomponent CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions among the phenyl building blocks within the cage frameworks results in twisted conformations, imparting planar chirality to the tetrahedrons. In instances where the trisaldehyde precursor features electron&#8208;withdrawing ester side chains, we observed that the intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces are strong enough to prevent racemization. To attain enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, a chiral amine was introduced during the imine formation process. The addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde precursor formed a trisimino intermediate. This chiral compound was subsequently combined with the achiral trisamino precursor, leading to an imine exchange reaction that releasing the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 75&#8201;%, exclusively composed of achiral building blocks. This experimental observation aligns with theoretical calculations based on the free energies of related cage structures. Moreover, since the chiral amine was not consumed during the imine exchange cycle, it enabled the enantioselective self&#8208;assembly of the tetrahedral cage for multiple cycles when new batches of the achiral trisaldehyde and trisamino precursors were successively added.

         <title>Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Salts: Their Porous Network Diversification and Construction of Chiral Helical Luminescent Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts (POSs) with a chiral helical network were constructed from a square&#8208;planar sulfonic acid and p&#8208;position&#8208;modified triphenylmethylamine, both achiral components. The chirality of the POSs could be controlled by chiral induction, and the obtained porous materials composed of hydrogen bonds exhibited solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study highlights applications for POSs as chiral materials.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are organic porous materials assembled via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between strong acids and bases such as sulfonic acids and amines. To diversify the network topology of POSs and extend its functions, this study focused on using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzenesulfonic acid (spiroBPS), which is a tetrasulfonic acid comprising a square planar skeleton. The POS consisting of spiroBPS and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) (spiroBPS/TPMA) was constructed from the two&#8208;fold interpenetration of an orthogonal network with pts topology, which has not been reported in conventional POSs, owing to the shape of the spirobifluorene backbone. Furthermore, combining tris(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Cl) and tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Br), which are bulkier than TPMA owing to the introduction of halogens at the p&#8208;position of the phenyl groups with spiroBPS allows us to construct novel POSs (spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl and spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Br). These POSs were constructed from a chiral helical network with pth topology, which was induced by the steric hindrance between the halogens and the curved fluorene skeleton. Moreover, spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl with pth topology exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state, which has not been reported in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;Dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;Oxy Motif: Method Development and Total Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Method development and total synthesis have resulted in the enantioselective synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif, and thus expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids), completed within 4&#8211;7 steps.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif is widely found in various types of bioactive natural products. However, present synthesis is mainly non&#8208;asymmetric which relied upon different olefination or transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions using enantioenriched precursors. Herein, based upon a newly developed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of conjugated polyenoic acids, a variety of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif (with E&#8208;configured internal olefin) was generated as the corresponding &#945;&#8208;adducts in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective manner. Utilizing 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif as key intermediates, we further demonstrated their synthetic potential by expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids) within 4&#8211;7 steps.

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation over Bicomponent Catalysts through Hydrogen Spillover</title>

         <dc:description>
Palladium, which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with copper, which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on palladium at low overpotentials and facilitate palladium&#8208;to&#8208;copper hydrogen transfer and timely desorptive hydrogenation on copper. As a result, a record high alkene production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved over this system at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation under mild conditions is a more attractive approach for alkene production than industrial routes but suffers from either low production efficiency or high energy consumption. Here, we describe a tandem catalytic concept that overcomes these challenges. Component (i), which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with component (ii), which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on component (i) at low overpotentials and timely (i)&#8208;to&#8208;(ii) hydrogen spillover and facile desorptive hydrogenation on component (ii). We examine this concept over bicomponent palladium&#8208;copper catalysts for the production of representative 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) from 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyne&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) and achieve a record high MBE production rate of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faraday efficiency of ~88.8&#8201;% at a low energy consumption of 1.26&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgMBE&#8722;1. With these catalysts, we further achieve 60&#8197;h continuous production of MBE with record high profit space.

This work unravels intricate pathway complexity&#8208;driven, controlled two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization in water and its impact on temporally controlled protein&#8208;surface interaction and enzymatic activity.







Abstract
In biological systems, programmable supramolecular frameworks characterized by coordinated directional non&#8208;covalent interactions are widespread. However, only a small number of reports involve pure water&#8208;based dynamic supramolecular assembly of artificial &#960;&#8208;amphiphiles, primarily due to the formidable challenge of counteracting the strong hydrophobic dominance of the &#960;&#8208;surface in water, leading to undesired kinetic traps. This study reveals the pathway complexity in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated supramolecular polymerization of an amide&#8208;functionalized naphthalene monoimide (NMI) building block with a hydrophilic oligo&#8208;oxyethylene (OE) wedge. O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 initially produced entropically driven, collapsed spherical particles in water (Agg&#8208;1); however, over a span of 72&#8197;h, these metastable Agg&#8208;1 gradually transformed into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets (Agg&#8208;2), favoured by both entropy and enthalpy contributions. The intricate self&#8208;assembly pathways in O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 enable us to explore seed&#8208;induced living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) in water for controlled synthesis of monolayered 2D assemblies. Furthermore, we demonstrated the nonspecific surface adsorption of a model enzyme, serine protease &#945;&#8208;Chymotrypsin (&#945;&#8208;ChT), and consequently the enzyme activity, which could be regulated by controlling the morphological transformation of O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 from Agg&#8208;1 to Agg&#8208;2. We delve into the thermodynamic aspects of such shape&#8208;dependent protein&#8208;surface interactions and unravel the impact of seed&#8208;induced LSP on temporally controlling the catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;ChT.

         <title>Regulating Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Weakly Solvating Electrolyte towards Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weakly solvating electrolyte is formulated with 2 &#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran to decrease the ion&#8208;dipole interactions. Its anion&#8208;enhanced solvation structures facilitate stable sodium storage in hard carbon anode at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. The full cell paired with NVP cathode operates over 250 stable cycles with high capacity retention of ~100&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra&#8208;low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion&#8208;dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+&#8208;dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion&#8208;enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic&#8208;rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of &#8722;83.3&#8201;&#176;C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40 and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work sheds new lights on the ion&#8208;dipole regulation for ultra&#8208;low temperature SIBs.

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Based Fully Non&#8208;fused Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor, GS70, is synthesized by incorporating 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as a &#960;&#8208;bridge, aiming to reduce material costs and enhance stability. The obtained active layers exhibit favorable morphology and effectively suppress charge recombination. Encouragingly, this design leads to the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and stable single&#8208;junction and parallel tandem OSCs.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are still suffering from the low light utilization and unstable under ultraviolet irradiation. To tackle these challenges, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;fused acceptor based on 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as &#960;&#8208;bridge unit, denoted as GS70, which serves as active layer in the front&#8208;cell for constructing tandem OSCs with a parallel configuration. Benefiting from the well&#8208;complementary absorption spectra with the rear&#8208;cell, GS70&#8208;based parallel tandem OSCs exhibit an improved photoelectron response over the range between 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm, yielding a high short&#8208;circuit current density of 28.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The improvement in light utilization translates to a power conversion efficiency of 19.4&#8201;%, the highest value among all parallel tandem OSCs. Notably, owing to the intrinsic stability of GS70, the manufactured parallel tandem OSCs retain 84.9&#8201;% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;hours. Overall, this work offers novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost and stability non&#8208;fused acceptors, emphasizing the importance of adopting a parallel tandem configuration for achieving efficient light harvesting and improved photostability in OSCs.

A cross&#8208;interfacial electronic bridges (CIEBs) is constructed via interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates. Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Nevertheless, the insufficient long&#8208;term stability remains a widespread concern owing to the inevitable 2&#8208;electron byproducts, H2O2. Here, we construct Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr cross&#8208;interfacial electron bridges (CIEBs) via the interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs is synthesized by the molten salt template method, exhibiting dominant 4&#8208;electron selectively and extremely low H2O2 yield confirmed by Damjanovic kinetic analysis. The Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs demonstrates impressive bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (&#9653;E=0.70&#8197;V) and breakthrough durability including 100&#8201;% current retention after 10&#8197;h continuous operation and cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h for Zn&#8208;air battery. The hybrid interfacial configuration and the understanding of the electronic coupling mechanism reported here could shed new light on the design of superdurable M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.

         <title>Grafting Ultra&#8208;fine Nanoalloys with Amorphous Skin Enables Highly Active and Long&#8208;lived Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of grafting PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; onto ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys achieved the effects of three birds with one stone: improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface, increased the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, and mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic environments.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale deployment of proton exchange membranes water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE) requires a substantial reduction in usage of platinum group metals (PGMs) as indispensable electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ultra&#8208;fine PGMs nanocatalysts possess abundant catalytic sites at lower loading, but usually exhibit reduced stability in long&#8208;term operations under corrosive acidic environments. Here we report grafting the ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys with PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; (c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez) by in situ atomic layer selenation to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and stability. We found that the c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez&#8208;1 with ~0.6&#8197;nm thickness amorphous skin achieved an ultra&#8208;high mass activity of 26.7&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt+Ru at &#8722;0.07&#8197;V as well as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability maintained for at least 1000&#8197;h at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 550&#8197;h at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 for acid HER. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the amorphous skin not only improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, but also mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. This work demonstrates a direction of designing ultra&#8208;fine PGMs electrocatalysts both with high utilization and robust durability, offers an in situ &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; engineering strategy.

         <title>Tethered Trimeric Small&#8208;molecular Acceptors through Aromatic&#8208;core Engineering for Highly Efficient and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, aromatic&#8208;core engineering was conducted on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core to precisely regulate the geometry of tethered dimeric acceptors, revealing a more advantageous molecular packing for the meta&#8208;positioned dimers. This finding led to the design of a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned trimer, demonstrating enhanced device stability and performance.







Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on a blend of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with polymer donors, where thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs poses critical concerns on operational stability. To tackle this issue, tethered SMAs, wherein multiple SMA&#8208;subunits are connected to the aromatic&#8208;core via flexible chains, are proposed. This design aims to an elevated glass transition temperature (Tg) for a dynamical control. However, attaining an elevated Tg value with additional SMA subunits introduces complexity to the molecular packing, posing a significant challenge in realizing both high stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we initiate isomer engineering on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core and find that meta&#8208;positioned dimeric BDY&#8208;&#946; exhibits more favorable molecular packing compared to its para&#8208;positioned counterpart, BDY&#8208;&#945;. With this encouraging result, we expand our approach by introducing an additional SMA unit onto the aromatic core of BDY&#8208;&#946;, maintaining a meta&#8208;position relative to each SMA unit location in the tethered acceptor. This systematic aromatic&#8208;core engineering results in a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned molecular geometry. The supramolecular interactions of SMA units in the trimer contribute to enhancements in Tg value, crystallinity, and a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to dimers. These characteristics result in a noteworthy increase in PCE to 18.24&#8201;%, coupled with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the trimer&#8208;based devices delivered an excellent thermal stability with over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1200&#8197;h thermal degradation. Our findings underscore the promise and feasibility of tethered trimeric structures in achieving highly ordered aggregation behavior and increased Tg value in PSCs, simultaneously improving in device efficiency and thermal stability.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;mimetic Engineered Protein Fibers with High Toughness and Minimized Batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch Variations through &#946;&#8208;sheets Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spidroin&#8208;derived modular proteins have been designed and the fabricated fibers demonstrate a toughness of up to 200&#8197;MJ/m3, achieving the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. By co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets in the two structural proteins, the fibers&#8217; mechanical performance and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch stability have been improved significantly.







Abstract
Synthetic spidroin fibers have not yet attained the same level of toughness and stability as natural spider silks due to the complexity of composition and hierarchical structure. Particularly, understanding the intricate interactions between spidroin components in spider fiber is still elusive. Herein, we report modular design and preparation of spidroin&#8208;mimetic fibers composed of a conservative C&#8208;terminus spidroin module, two different natural &#946;&#8208;sheets modules, and a non&#8208;spidroin random&#8208;coil module. The resulting fibers exhibit a toughness of ~200&#8197;MJ/m3, reaching the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. The interactions between two components of recombinant spidroins facilitate the intermolecular co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability in the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers. Additionally, the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers offer potential applications in implantable or even edible devices. Therefore, our work presents a generic strategy to develop high&#8208;performance protein fibers for diverse translations in different scenarios.

         <title>Highly Stable Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries via Regulated Photo&#8208;Induced Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light can significantly improve the performance of batteries. However, zinc ion battery often exhibits poor cycling life under illumination, which limits its application and the mechanism is still ambiguous. This work demonstrates integrated photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;ion batteries with high cyclic stability of 4000 cycles, extending the previous record by one order of magnitude through the discovery and optimization of a photo&#8208;induced proton transfer.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries utilize light to boost capacity but face cycling instability due to complex charge/ion transfer under illumination. This study identified photo&#8208;induced proton transfer (photo&#8208;induced PT) as a significant process in photo&#8208;(dis)charging of widely&#8208;used V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion batteries, contributing to enhanced capacity under illumination but jeopardizing photo&#8208;stability. Photo&#8208;induced PT occurs at 100&#8197;ps after photo&#8208;excitation, inducing rapid proton extraction into V2O5 photoelectrode. This process creates a proton&#8208;deficient microenvironment on surface, leading to repetitive cathode dissolution and anode corrosion in each cycle. Enabling the intercalated protons from photo&#8208;induced PT to be reversibly employed in charge&#8208;discharge processes via the anode&#8208;alloying strategy achieves high photo&#8208;stability for the battery. Consequently, a ~54&#8201;% capacity enhancement was achieved in a V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion battery under illumination, with ~90&#8201;% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This extends the photo&#8208;stability record by 10&#8197;times. This study offers promising advancements in energy storage by addressing instability issues in photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries.

This study identified photo-induced proton transfer (photo-induced PT) as a significant process in photo-(dis)charging of widely-used V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-based zinc-ion batteries, contributing to enhanced capacity under illumination but jeopardizing photo-stability. Photo-induced PT occurs at 100&#8197;ps after photo-excitation, inducing rapid proton extraction into V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectrode. This process creates a proton-deficient microenvironment on surface, leading to repetitive cathode dissolution and anode corrosion in each cycle. Enabling the intercalated protons from photo-induced PT to be reversibly employed in charge-discharge processes via the anode-alloying strategy achieves high photo-stability for the battery. Consequently, a ~54&#8201;% capacity enhancement was achieved in a V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-based zinc-ion battery under illumination, with ~90&#8201;% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This extends the photo-stability record by 10&#8197;times. This study offers promising advancements in energy storage by addressing instability issues in photo-assisted ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging of Cove Regions: A Strategy for Realizing Persistently Chiral Double Heterohelicenes with Attractive Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through bridging the cove regions of a double helicene, chiral compounds featuring a small 3D cavity have been synthesized. The structural features endow these compounds with persistent chirality. Moreover, the introduced bridging groups result in attractive luminescent properties, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
The racemization of chiral organic compounds is a common chemical phenomenon. However, it often poses configurational&#8208;stability issues to the application of this class of compounds. Achieving chiral organic compounds without the risk of racemization is fascinating, but it is challenging due to a lack of strategies. Here, we reveal the cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy for achieving persistently chiral multi&#8208;helicenes (incapable of racemization), based on the synthesized proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept double hetero[4]helicenes featuring macrocycle structures with a small 3D cavity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the strategy is also effective in tuning the electronic structures of multi&#8208;helicenes, resulting in a conversion from luminescence silence into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for the present system. Furthermore, red circularly polarized TADF based on small double [4]helicene systems is achieved for the first time using this strategy. The disclosed cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy provides an opportunity to modulate the electronic structures and luminescent properties of multi&#8208;helicenes without concern for racemization, thus significantly enhancing the structural and property diversity of multi&#8208;helicenes for various applications.

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Dependent Labeling of Organelles with a Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Phosphorus&#8208;Bridged Rhodamine Dye in Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>

Phospha&#8208;rhodamine (POR) dyes bearing a 2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;benzothiophenyl group were developed for labeling organelles of interest. The stereoisomers, arising from restricted rotation between the xanthene skeleton and the thiophene ring, showed distinct staining performance. One isomer selectively labeled HaloTag&#8208;fused proteins in cells, while the other isomer exhibited non&#8208;specific accumulation on organelle membranes, where dyes aggregated within the lipid bilayer.







Abstract
The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores that have both excellent chemical stability and photostability, as well as efficient cell permeability, is highly demanded. In this study, we present phospha&#8208;rhodamine (POR) dyes which display significantly improved performance for protein labeling. This is achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;benzothiophenyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the xanthene scaffold. The resulting cis and trans isomers were successfully isolated and structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction. The HaloTag ligand conjugates of the two isomers exhibited different staining abilities in live cells. While the cis isomer showed non&#8208;specific accumulation on the organelle membranes, the trans isomer selectively labeled the HaloTag&#8208;fused proteins, enabling the long&#8208;term imaging of cell division and the 5&#8208;color imaging of cell organelles. Molecular dynamics simulations of the HaloTag ligand conjugates within the lipid membrane suggested that the cis isomer is more prone to forming oligomers in the membrane. In contrast, the oligomerization of the trans isomer is effectively suppressed by its interaction with the lipid molecules. By taking advantage of the superior labeling performance of the trans isomer and its NIR&#8208;emissive properties, multi&#8208;color time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution 3D imaging, namely super&#8208;resolution 5D&#8208;imaging, of the interconnected network between the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was achieved in living cells.

         <title>Multisite Fine&#8208;Tuning in Hybrid Cadmium Halides Enables Wide Range Emissions for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

Large&#8208;scale spectral regulation was demonstrated in a single matrix of [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) via multisite fine&#8208;tuning strategy, and the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions were established for multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multiple information storage through simply excitation changing.







Abstract
Achieving tunable emissions spanning the spectrum, from blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, within a single component is a formidable challenge with significant implication, particularly in tailoring multicolor luminescence for anti&#8208;counterfeiting purposes. In this study, we demonstrate a broad spectrum of emissions, covering blue to red and extending into NIR light in [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) through precise multisite structural fine&#8208;tuning. Notably, the multicolor emissions from [BPy]2CdBr4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+ manifest a distinctive pattern, transitioning from blue to yellow in tandem with the host [BPy]2CdBr4 and further extending from yellow to NIR with its homologous [BPy]2CdCl4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+, resulting in the simultaneous presence of intersecting and independent emission colors. Detailed modulation of chemical composition enables partial luminescence switching, facilitating the creation of diverse patterns with multicolor luminescence by employing [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ as phosphors. This study for the first time successfully implements several groups of tunable emission colors in a single matrix via multisite fine&#8208;tuning. Such an effective strategy not only develops the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions, but also introduces a cost&#8208;effective and straightforward approach to achieving unique, high&#8208;level, plentiful&#8208;color and multiple&#8208;information&#8208;storage labels for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Collective Effect in a Multicomponent Ensemble Combining Single Atoms and Nanoparticles for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles, and Fe&#8722;CeO2 nanoparticles in an active multicomponent ensemble has been unraveled with the capacity to simultaneously enhance ORR activity (a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.948&#8197;V vs. RHE) and durability (negligible loss after 50k&#8197;cycles) in alkaline. Density functional theory and machine learning reveal the necessary electronic interactions (&#1013;d, Wf, &#956;B, Q) and geometric interactions (d and dFe&#8722;N) in a collective effect.







Abstract
Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts represent one of the most promising non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, they still suffer from insufficient activity and, particularly, durability for practical applications. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML), we unravel an unexpected collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles (NPs), and Fe&#8722;CeO2 NPs. The collective effect comprises differently&#8208;weighted electronic and geometric interactions, whitch results in significantly enhanced ORR activity for FeN4OH active sites with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.948&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) in alkaline, relative to a commercial Pt/C (E1/2, 0.851&#8197;VRHE). Meanwhile, this collective effect endows the shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds and the remarkable durability with negligible activity loss after 50,000&#8197;potential cycles. The ML was used to understand the intricate geometric and electronic interactions in collective effect and reveal the intrinsic descriptors to account for the enhanced ORR performance. The universality of collective effect was demonstrated effective for the Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn&#8208;based multicomponent ensembles. These results confirm the importance of collective effect to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and durability.

&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;) and geometric interactions (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal single-atom catalysts represent one of the most promising non-noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, they still suffer from insufficient activity and, particularly, durability for practical applications. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML), we unravel an unexpected collective effect between FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH sites, CeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles (NPs), and Fe&#8722;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs. The collective effect comprises differently-weighted electronic and geometric interactions, whitch results in significantly enhanced ORR activity for FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH active sites with a half-wave potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.948&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;) in alkaline, relative to a commercial Pt/C (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.851&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;). Meanwhile, this collective effect endows the shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds and the remarkable durability with negligible activity loss after 50,000&#8197;potential cycles. The ML was used to understand the intricate geometric and electronic interactions in collective effect and reveal the intrinsic descriptors to account for the enhanced ORR performance. The universality of collective effect was demonstrated effective for the Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn-based multicomponent ensembles. These results confirm the importance of collective effect to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Ferroptosis&#8208;Inducing Arsenene&#8208;Iridium Nanoplatform for Synergistic Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an innovative arsenene&#8208;iridium nanoplatform AsIr@PDA by loading ferroptosis&#8208;inducing metal complex IrFN on arsenene nanosheets. The effective release of IrFN from AsIr@PDA induced pancreatic cancer cell ferroptosis, and the ferroptotic cell death together with the immunomodulatory arsenene endows AsIr@PDA with a superior therapeutic effect by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;induced chemotherapy and immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy.







Abstract
Due to multidrug resistance and the high risk of recurrence, effective and less toxic alternative pancreatic cancer treatments are urgently needed. Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to apoptosis but sensitive to ferroptosis. In this study, an innovative nanoplatform (AsIr@PDA) was developed by electrostatic adsorption of a cationic iridium complex (IrFN) onto two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arsenene nanosheets. This nanoplatform exhibits superior ferroptosis&#8208;inducing effects with high drug loading capacity and, importantly, excellent anti&#8208;cancer immune activation function, leading to efficient elimination of pancreatic tumors with no observable side effects. Interestingly, AsIr@PDA significantly prevents the recurrence of pancreatic cancer in vivo when compared with a cisplatin&#8208;loaded nanoplatform. This designed nanoplatform demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;induced chemotherapy with immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, providing new insights for future pancreatic cancer therapy.

         <title>Delocalization Engineering of Heme&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Enzymes for Augmented Reactive Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) were synthesized as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS production even than the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related catalysis has broad applicability. Herein, inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, we report the synthesis of polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) as a new porphyrin&#8208;evolving structure to serve as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to the structural advantages, such as enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS&#8208;production activity in terms of Vmax and turnover numbers as compared with porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPor&#8208;AE), which also surpassed reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art artificial enzymes in their activity. More interestingly, by changing the reaction medium and substrates, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE also revealed significantly improved activity and environmental adaptivity in many other ROS&#8208;related biocatalytic processes, validating the potential of Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE to replace conventional (poly)porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics for ROS&#8208;related catalysis, biosensors, or biotherapeutics. It is suggested that this study will offer essential guidance for designing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers.

         <title>Spaced Double Hydrogen Bonding in an Imidazole Poly Ionic Liquid Composite for Highly Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Air Reductive H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spaced double hydrogen bonds in an imidazole poly ionic liquid surface can change the active site from being a covered state to a fully exposed one. This results in a more positive potential and more efficient orbital binding patterns giving better active sites for the selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reductive H2O2 production is a promising approach to alternative industrial anthraquinone processes while suffering from the requirement of pure O2 feedstock for practical application. Herein, we report a spaced double hydrogen bond (IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond) through multi&#8208;component Radziszewski reaction in an imidazole poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite (SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2) and levofloxacin hydrochloride (LEV) electron donor for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production. It is found that the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond formed by spaced imino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) group of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 and carbonyl (&#8722;C=O) group of LEV can switch the imidazole active sites characteristic from a covered state to a fully exposed one to shield the strong adsorption of electron donor and N2 in the air, and propel an intenser positive potential and more efficient orbitals binding patterns of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 surface to establish competitive active sites for selectivity O2 chemisorption. Moreover, the high electron enrichment of imidazole as an active site for the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction ensures the rapid reduction of O2. Therefore, the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond enables a total O2 utilization and conversion efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% from direct photocatalytic air reduction, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 1518&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h that is 16 and 23&#8197;times compared to poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite without spaced imino groups (PIL&#8208;TiO2) and TiO2, respectively.

         <title>Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6): A Multi&#8208;Chromophore Chalcogenide with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Property Designed by Group Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) was designed and synthesized using the &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy. Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a large SHG (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap of 2.45&#8197;eV, a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm), a broad IR transparent region (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m) as well as the congruent&#8208;melting behavior, which indicate that it is a promising IR NLO material.







Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar materials capable of exhibiting many important functional properties are indispensable for electro&#8208;optical technologies, yet their rational structural design remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy for designing the first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6), that crystallizes in a NCS and polar space group of Cm. The structure features a unique basic building unit (BBU) [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)], formed through &#8220;grafting [In4Se10] supertetrahedra on the root of [In(P2Se6)2] groups&#8221;. Theoretical calculations confirm that this [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)] BBU can achieve a &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; combination of properties from two chromophores, [In4Se10] supertetrahedron and ethane&#8208;like [P2Se6] dimer. That makes Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a large band gap (2.45&#8197;eV), broad infrared (IR) transmission (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m), a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm) as well as the congruently&#8208;melting property at ~700&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) will be a promising NLO crystal, especially in the IR region, and this research also demonstrates that &#8220;group grafting&#8221; will be an effective strategy for constructing novel polar BBUs with multi&#8208;chromophore to design NCS structures and high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

&lt;p&gt;Non-centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar materials capable of exhibiting many important functional properties are indispensable for electro-optical technologies, yet their rational structural design remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy for designing the first multi-chromophore selenophosphate, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In(In&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), that crystallizes in a NCS and polar space group of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;.

         <title>A Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst [Co2O2] Metallacycle Enables Regioselective Allene C(sp2)&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy chemistry fuels the development of synthetic chemistry. Structurally well&#8208;defined [Co2O2] metallacycle complexes are developed as robust hydrogen evolution catalysts, unlocking the regioselective allene C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization. A broad range of simple allenes are readily upgraded to synthetically useful allenols with unconventional chemoselectivity, high regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance, and mild conditions.







Abstract
Selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H is an ideal approach to upgrading simple allenes to synthetically useful allenes, albeit suffering from challenges associated with inert reactivity and inferior selectivity. Inspired by energy chemistry, a catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strategy was leveraged to selectively activate weakly acidic allene C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds in a reductive mode. An array of [Co2O2] metallacycle complexes were readily devised starting from amino acids, and they were demonstrated as robust HER catalysts, which would selectively break allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds to release hydrogen. With the newly developed HER catalyst, regioselective electrochemical functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H with alcoholic &#945; C(sp3)&#8208;H was unprecedentedly achieved. This strategy features excellent regioselectivity, unconventional chemoselectivity, good functional&#8208;group tolerance (62 examples), and mild conditions. Mechanism experiments revealed a reactive hydroxy&#8208;coordinated cobalt(II) species in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to rationalize the regioselectivity observed in the reaction.

         <title>Chiral Truxene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Cages: Triple Interlocking and Supramolecular Chirogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral self&#8208;assembled cage constructed from the truxene framework dimerizes in solution thanks to favourable geometric and electronic parameters. The interlocked dimer can be dissociated upon forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complex in the presence of a guest. The chiral cavity induces chirality in the achiral guest molecule, as characterized by circular dichroism measurements.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral elements in host&#8211;guest systems currently attracts much attention because of the major impact such structures may have in a wide range of applications, from pharmaceuticals to materials science and beyond. Moreover, the development of multi&#8208;responsive and &#8208;functional systems is highly desirable since they offer numerous benefits. In this context, we describe herein the construction of a metal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled cage that associates a chiral truxene&#8208;based ligand and a bis&#8208;ruthenium complex. The maximum separation between both facing chiral units in the assembly is fixed by the intermetallic distance within the lateral bis&#8208;ruthenium complex (8.4&#8197;&#197;). The resulting chiral cavity was shown to encapsulate polyaromatic guest molecules, but also to afford a chiral triply interlocked [2]catenane structure. The formation of the latter occurs at high concentration, while its disassembly could be achieved by the addition of a planar achiral molecule. Interestingly the planar achiral molecule exhibits induced circular dichroism signature when trapped within the chiral cavity, thus demonstrating the ability of the cage to induce supramolecular chirogenesis.

         <title>Enhanced Charge Transfer Process and Photocatalytic Activity over a Phosphonate&#8208;based MOF via Amorphization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the intrinsic relationship between the property and amorphous structural was studied. Distorted metal nodes in amorphous metal&#8211;organic frameworks affect the electronic structure with downshifted conduction band (CB) potential, which facilitates the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process and O2 activation. Amorphous material displays a better photocatalytic activity of toluene oxidation than crystalline one (2.45&#8197;times).







Abstract
Recently, amorphous materials have gained great attention as an emerging kind of functional material, and their characteristics such as isotropy, absence of grain boundaries, and abundant defects are very likely to outrun the disadvantages of crystalline counterparts, such as low conductivity, and ultimately lead to improved charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we investigated the effect of amorphization on the charge transfer process and photocatalytic performance with a phosphonate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (FePPA) as the research object. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that compared to crystalline FePPA, amorphous FePPA has more distorted metal nodes, which affects the electron distribution and consequently improves the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the distorted metal nodes in amorphous FePPA also greatly promote the adsorption and activation of O2. Hence, amorphous FePPA exhibits a better performance of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation for selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. This work illustrates the advantages of amorphous MOFs in the charge transfer process, which is conducive to the further development of high performance MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts.

The bicontinuous architecture enables efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal regions of the COFs, leading to high accessibility of their active catalytic sites and excellent NO removal capability.







Abstract
Introducing continuous mesochannels into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to increase the accessibility of their inner active sites has remained a major challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of COFs with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure, via a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly&#8208;guided nanocasting strategy. Three different mesostructured COFs are synthesized, including two covalent triazine frameworks and one vinylene&#8208;linked COF. The new materials are endowed with a hierarchical meso/microporous architecture, in which the mesochannels exhibit an ordered shifted double diamond (SDD) topology. The hierarchically porous structure can enable efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal of the COFs and consequently high accessibility of their active catalytic sites. Benefiting from this hierarchical structure, these COFs exhibit excellent performance in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic NO removal with a high conversion percentage of up to 51.4&#8201;%, placing them one of the top reported NO&#8208;elimination photocatalysts. This study represents the first case of introducing a bicontinuous structure into COFs, which opens a new avenue for the synthesis of hierarchically porous COFs and for increasing the utilization degree of their internal active sites.

         <title>12 Connecting Sites Linked Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Intrinsic Non&#8208;interpenetrated shp Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented 12 connecting sites linked three&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with intrinsic non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology have been fabricated and structurally characterized, which show efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O.







Abstract
Developing high connectivity (&gt;8) three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards new topologies and functions remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in getting high connectivity organic building blocks. This however represents the most important step towards promoting the diversity of COFs due to the still limited dynamic covalent bonds available for constructing COFs at this stage. Herein, highly connected phthalocyanine&#8208;based (Pc&#8208;based) 3D COFs MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs (M=H2, Ni) were afforded from the reaction between 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine M(TAPc) (M=H2, Ni) and 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexayl)hexa(isophthalohydrazide) (THHI) with 12 connecting sites. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis together with theoretical simulations and transmission electron microscopy reveals their crystalline nature with an unprecedented non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology. Experimental and theoretical investigations disclose the broadened visible light absorption range and narrow optical band gap of MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs. This in combination with their 3D nanochannels endows them with efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O via 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and 2e&#8722; water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm). This work provides valuable result for the development of high connectivity functional COFs towards diverse application potentials.

Developing NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate traditional photodynamic theranostics. Herein, we innovatively propose an acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer strategy toward facilitating the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs of photosensitizers for amplifying oxygen&#8208;independent photodynamic oncotherapy.







Abstract
Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) caused by the inherent oxygen consumption of traditional Type&#8208;II PDT and anoxic tumor microenvironment. The challenge for the exploration of Type&#8208;I PSs is to facilitate the electron transfer ability of photosensitization molecules for transforming oxygen or H2O to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we propose an electronic acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer (a&#8208;PET) strategy promoting the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs by marriage of two organic semiconducting molecules of a non&#8208;fullerene scaffold&#8208;based photosensitizer and a perylene diimide that significantly boost the Type&#8208;I PDT pathway to produce plentiful ROS, especially, inducing 3.5&#8208;fold and 2.5&#8208;fold amplification of hydroxyl (OH&#8901;) and superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8901;) generation. Systematic mechanism exploration reveals that intermolecular electron transfer and intramolecular charge separation after photoirradiation generate a competent production of radical ion pairs that promote the Type&#8208;I PDT process by theoretical calculation and ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy. By complementary tumor diagnosis with photoacoustic imaging and second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, this as&#8208;prepared nanoplatform exhibits fabulous photocytotoxicity in harsh hypoxic conditions and terrific cancer revoked abilities in living mice. We envision that this work will broaden the insight into high&#8208;efficiency Type&#8208;I PDT for cancer phototheranostics.

Ultrasonication&#8208;assisted polymerization is useful method to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymer with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers molecular weights with high reproducibility.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymers with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. Once such an easily accessible methodology is established, which can not only contribute to overcome the current limitation of the statistically determined nature of semiconducting polymers, but also facilitate rapid incorporation into the broad synthetic chemists&#8217; toolbox. Here, we describe a simple yet robust ultrasonication&#8208;assisted Stille polymerization for accessing semiconducting polymers with high&#8208;precision tailored molecular weights (from low to ultrahigh molecular weight ranges) while mitigating their interbatch variations. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers&#8217; molecular weights with high reproducibility to satisfy all the optical/electrical and morphological demands of diverse types of high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer&#8208;based devices; as demonstrated in in&#8208;depth experimental screenings in applications of both organic and perovskite photovoltaics. We believe that this methodology provides a fast development of new and existing semiconducting polymers with the highest&#8208;level performances possible on various photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Positional Thiophene Isomerization: A Geometric Strategy for Precisely Regulating the Electronic State of Covalent Organic Frameworks to Boost Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric strategy to regulate the electron environment of active sites of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts via dangling thiophene units inside and outside COF rings is reported. The isomeric COF&#8208;&#946; with exposed active sites and localized charges show high activity, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites.







Abstract
With the oxygen conversion efficiency of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based fuel cells dramatically improved, the building blocks of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) raised principal concerns on the catalytic active sites with indistinct electronic states. Herein, to address this issue, we demonstrate COFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by regulating the edge&#8208;hanging thiophene units, and the molecular geometries are further modulated via positional thiophene isomerization strategy, affording isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substitution and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substitution on the frameworks. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption ability are well&#8208;regulated through geometric modification, resulting in controllable chemical activity and local density of &#960;&#8208;electrons. Notably, the introduction of thiophene units with different substitution positions into a pristine pure carbon&#8208;based COF model COF&#8208;Ph achieves excellent activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is higher than most of those metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Utilizing the combination of theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, we show that the isomeric thiophene skeleton (COF&#8208;&#945; and COF&#8208;&#946;) can induce the dangling unit activation, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#945;&#8208;position) adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites. The results suggest that the isomeric dangling groups in COFs are suitable for the ORR with promising geometry construction.

&lt;p&gt;A geometric strategy to regulate the electron environment of active sites of metal-free carbon-based catalysts via dangling thiophene units inside and outside COF rings is reported. The isomeric &lt;b&gt;COF-&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with exposed active sites and localized charges show high activity, accurately identifying the pentacyclic-carbon adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the oxygen conversion efficiency of metal-free carbon-based fuel cells dramatically improved, the building blocks of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) raised principal concerns on the catalytic active sites with indistinct electronic states. Herein, to address this issue, we demonstrate COFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by regulating the edge-hanging thiophene units, and the molecular geometries are further modulated via positional thiophene isomerization strategy, affording isomeric &lt;b&gt;COF-&#945;&lt;/b&gt; with 2-substitution and &lt;b&gt;COF-&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with 3-substitution on the frameworks. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption ability are well-regulated through geometric modification, resulting in controllable chemical activity and local density of &#960;-electrons. Notably, the introduction of thiophene units with different substitution positions into a pristine pure carbon-based COF model &lt;b&gt;COF-Ph&lt;/b&gt; achieves excellent activity with a half-wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is higher than most of those metal-free or metal-based electrocatalysts. Utilizing the combination of theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, we show that the isomeric thiophene skeleton (&lt;b&gt;COF-&#945;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;COF-&#946;&lt;/b&gt;) can induce the dangling unit activation, accurately identifying the pentacyclic-carbon (thiophene &#945;-position) adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites. The results suggest that the isomeric dangling groups in COFs are suitable for the ORR with promising geometry construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metastable Liquid Properties and Surface Flow Patterns of Ultrahigh Temperature Alloys Explored in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K was achieved by the Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy in outer space, inducing surface nucleation and rapid solidification. High spherical alloy droplets assure precise determination of liquid properties. High&#8208;temperature liquid&#8216;s chemical bonds and atomic structures were revealed.







Abstract
The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000&#8197;K remain a huge challenge for ground&#8208;based research on liquid materials chemistry. We show the strong undercooling capability, metastable liquid properties and surface wave patterns of refractory Nb&#8722;Si and Zr&#8722;V binary alloys explored in space environment. The floating droplet of Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy superheated up to 2338&#8197;K exhibited an extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K, approaching the 0.2TE threshold for homogeneous nucleation of liquid&#8208;solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr64V36 alloy surface during liquid&#8208;solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.

Indigo , an ancient, plant&#8208;derived fabric dye, can be used to make Fe coordination polymers on silver surfaces as reported by Biao Yang, Joachim Reichert, Shobhana Narasimhan, Johannes&#8197;V. Barth, Anthoula&#8197;C. Papageorgiou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202319162). Within such coordination polymers on the close&#8208;packed silver surface, thermally activated switches from trans to cis indigo are triggered and result in isomeric indigo&#8208;Fe coordination polymers.

Selenium&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry creates seleno&#8208;connecting linkage to efficiently explore the organo&#8208;Se chemical world. In their Research Article (e202318534), Wei Hou, Hongtao Xu et&#8197;al. put forward the concept of SeNEx chemistry based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. This reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics, and can be used in nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein bioconjugation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

We outline the recent progress on bulk and thin&#8208;film metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in the context of their electrical properties and related electronic device configurations. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the electrical conductivity of MOFs are emphasized.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline, nano&#8208;porous materials made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;based &#8216;nodes&#8217; and organic linkers. Most of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&#8722;7&#8211;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and surface&#8208;anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for MOFs&#8208;based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review highlights the pros and cons of MOFs&#8208;based electronics (MOFtronics), followed by an analysis of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and result in improved devices performance.

         <title>Photocatalysis Meets Confinement: An Emerging Opportunity for Photoinduced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) have emerged as highly promising dual&#8208;functional enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts that can initiate the photochemical transformations and achieve distinctive selectivities with multiple noncovalent host&#8211;guest interactions as control forces. This review summaries recent advances of organic transformation using PMOCs as supramolecular reactors through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (ET) processes.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been evolved as a paradigm of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts since they are able to synergize multifunctionalities inherent in metal and organic components and constitute microenvironments characteristic of enzymatic spatial confinement and versatile host&#8211;guest interactions, thus facilitating unconventional organic transformations via unique driving&#8208;forces such as weak noncovalent binding and electron/energy transfer. Recently, MOC&#8208;based photoreactors emerged as a burgeoning platform of supramolecular photocatalysis, displaying anomalous reactivities and selectivities distinct from bulk solution. This perspective recaps two decades journey of the photoinduced radical reactions by using photoactive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) as artificial reactors, outlining how the cage&#8208;confined photocatalysis was evolved from stoichiometric photoreactions to photocatalytic turnover, from high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;irradiation to sustainable visible&#8208;light photoactivation, and from simple radical reactions to multi&#8208;level chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. We will focus on PMOCs that merge structural and functional biomimicry into a single&#8208;cage to behave as multi&#8208;role photoreactors, emphasizing their potentials in tackling current challenges in organic transformations through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) pathways in a simple, green while feasible manner.

         <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Harvesting Materials Based on Organic Photovoltaic D/A Heterojunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D/A heterojunction photosensitizers, composed of organic photovoltaic electron donors and acceptors, have been applied in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions and demonstrated an exciting solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. The confronted challenges and possible opportunities are indicated with the aim of boosting research on organic D/A heterojunction photosensitizers further.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is a highly promising method to meet the surging energy consumption globally through the environmentally friendly means. As the initial step before photocatalysis, harvesting photons from sunlight is crucially important, thus making the design of photosensitizers with visible even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions get more and more attentions. In the past three years, organic donor/acceptor (D/A) heterojunctions with absorptions extending to 950&#8197;nm, have emerged as the new star light&#8208;harvesting materials for photocatalytic water splitting, demonstrating exciting advantages over inorganic materials in solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. This Minireview firstly gives a brief discussion about the principle processes and determining factors for photocatalytic water splitting with organic photovoltaic D/A heterojunction as photosensitizers. Thereafter, the current progress is summarized in details by introducing typical and excellent D/A heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Finally, not only the great prospects but also the most challenging issues confronted by organic D/A heterojunctions are indicated along with a perspective on the opportunities and new directions for future material explorations.

         <title>Nitrogenous Intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly evolving field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalysis encompasses various processes, ranging from green NH3 synthesis and the construction of C&#8722;N bonds with small molecules to the synthesis of nitrogenous compounds with unconventional oxidation states. The review aims to provide insights into recent progress, research methodologies, and prospective avenues for the regulated generation and in situ utilization of nitrogenous intermediates.







Abstract
Chemical manufacturing utilizing renewable sources and energy emerges as a promising path towards sustainability and carbon neutrality. The electrocatalytic reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) offered a potential strategy for synthesizing various nitrogenous chemicals. However, it is currently hindered by low selectivity/efficiency and limited reaction pathways, mainly due to the difficulties in controllable generation and utilization of nitrogenous intermediates. In this minireview, focusing on nitrogenous intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions, we discuss newly developed methodologies for studying and controlling the generation, conversion, and utilizing of nitrogenous intermediates, which enable recent developments in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions that yield various products, including ammonia (NH3), organonitrogen molecules, and nitrogenous compounds exhibiting unconventional oxidation states. Furthermore, we also make an outlook to highlight future directions in the emerging field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Multifold Post&#8208;Modification of Macrocycles and Cages by Isocyanate&#8208;Induced Azadefluorination Cyclisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents through azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC), which enables multistep supramolecular chemistry using readily available isocyanates, allowing the functionalization of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages&#8242; exterior chemical spaces. With ditopic isocyanates, ADFC can be used to create cross&#8208;linked membranes from supramolecular entities.







Abstract
We present the multiple post&#8208;modification of organic macrocycles and cages, introducing functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents, which opens up new possibilities in multi&#8208;step supramolecular chemistry employing the vast chemical space of readily available isocyanates. The mechanism and scope of the reaction that proceeds after isocyanate addition to the benzylamine motif via an azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC) were investigated using DFT calculations, and a series of aromatic isocyanates with different electronic properties were tested. The compounds show excellent chemical stability and were fully characterised. They can be used for subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and ADFC can be used directly to generate cross&#8208;linked membranes from macrocycles or cages when using ditopic isocyanates. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis shows the proof of the formation of the desired supramolecular entity together with the connectivity predicted by calculations and from 19F NMR shifts, allowing the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages by ADFC.

         <title>The Retaining Pse5Ac7Ac Pseudaminyltransferase KpsS1 Defines a Previously Unreported glycosyltransferase family (GT118)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pse5Ac7Ac glycosyltransferase (GT) activity has been demonstrated in characterisation of the retaining pseudaminyltransferase (PseT) KpsS1, the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118). KpsS1 is utilised in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of a glycoside terminating in Pse5Ac7Ac, an important bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid Neu5Ac.







Abstract
Cell surface sugar 5,7&#8208;diacetyl pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) is a bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid, Neu5Ac, and contributes to the virulence of a number of multidrug resistant bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite its discovery in the surface glycans of bacteria over thirty years ago, to date no glycosyltransferase enzymes (GTs) dedicated to the synthesis of a pseudaminic acid glycosidic linkage have been unequivocally characterised in vitro. Herein we demonstrate that A.&#8197;baumannii KpsS1 is a dedicated pseudaminyltransferase enzyme (PseT) which constructs a Pse5Ac7Ac&#8208;&#945;(2,6)&#8208;Glcp linkage, and proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. We utilise this PseT activity in tandem with the biosynthetic enzymes required for CMP&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac assembly, in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;linked Pse5Ac7Ac glycoside. Due to its unique activity and protein sequence, we also assign KpsS1 as the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118).

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of S&#8722;Si Reagents by Silylium Ions for Their Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Addition Across C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ&#8208;generated bissilylated sulfonium ion is the actual catalyst in highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective addition reactions of thiosilanes across the C&#8722;C multiple bonds of alkynes and allenes, respectively (see scheme). These thiosilylation reactions enable the direct installation of two orthogonal linchpins for further chemoselective functional&#8208;group manipulation.







Abstract
A regioselective silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;promoted thiosilylation of internal C&#8722;C triple bonds with control over the double bond geometry is described. Both a C(sp2)&#8722;S and a C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond are formed with a trans relationship in this two&#8208;component reaction of an alkyne and a thiosilane. The resulting orthogonally functionalized C&#8722;C double bond can be chemoselectively defunctionalized or further processed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions with the alkene configuration retained. The procedure is also applicable to the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective thiosilylation of terminal allenes to arrive at allylic thioethers containing a vinylsilane unit. These reactions involve the electrophilic activation of the S&#8722;Si reagent, both a silylated thiophenol and even alkylthiol derivative, by an in situ&#8208;generated carbocation intermediate. The catalytic cycle is maintained by a bissilylated aryl&#8208; or alkylsulfonium ion as a shuttle for the cationic silicon electrophile. Its independent preparation and structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction are also reported.

         <title>Fluorinated MOF&#8208;Based Hexafluoropropylene Nanotrap for Highly Efficient Purification of Octafluoropropane Electronic Specialty Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed fluoridated pore engineering strategy endows a cage&#8208;like MOF with molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation and highly efficient purification of C3F8 electronic specialty gas. Moreover, hydrophobic microenvironments generated by fluoridation groups significantly boost the chemical stability of MOF.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity octafluoropropane (C3F8) electronic specialty gas is a key chemical raw material in semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing industry, while selective removal of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) impurity for C3F8 purification is essential but a challenging task. Here we report a fluorinated cage&#8208;like MOF Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 (bzc=5&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) for C3F6/C3F8 separation. The incorporation of &#8722;CF3 groups not only provides suitable pore aperture size for highly efficient size&#8208;exclusive C3F6/C3F8 separation, but also creates hydrophobic microenvironments, endowing Zn&#8208;bz&#8208;CF3 high chemical stability. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 exhibits high C3F6 adsorption capacity while excluding C3F8, achieving ideal molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation. Breakthrough experiments show that Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 can efficiently separate C3F6/C3F8 mixture and high&#8208;purity C3F8 (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained.

&lt;p&gt;High-purity octafluoropropane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) electronic specialty gas is a key chemical raw material in semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing industry, while selective removal of hexafluoropropylene (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) impurity for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; purification is essential but a challenging task. Here we report a fluorinated cage-like MOF Zn-bzc-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (bzc=5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The incorporation of &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups not only provides suitable pore aperture size for highly efficient size-exclusive C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; separation, but also creates hydrophobic microenvironments, endowing Zn-bz-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; high chemical stability. Remarkably, Zn-bzc-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits high C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity while excluding C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving ideal molecular-sieving C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; separation. Breakthrough experiments show that Zn-bzc-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can efficiently separate C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; mixture and high-purity C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with the High&#8208;Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel halide solid electrolyte, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, is reported. The cation&#8208;anion radius ratio is found to be a pivotal factor in determining whether the anion sublattice will form cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) lattices in the halide Li3MX6 family. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 exhibits improved electrochemical reduction stability.







Abstract
The Li3MX6 compounds (M=Sc, Y, In; X=Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high&#8208;pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group P63mc with hexagonal close&#8208;packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient&#8208;pressure &#945;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li3MX6 family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, rM/rX, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the ccp rM/rX threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp&#8208;to&#8208;hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.

         <title>Ruthenium Single Atomic Sites Surrounding the Support Pit with Exceptional Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;metal atomic sites and vacancies can accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons and enhance photocatalytic performance in photocatalysis. In this study, a series of nickel hydroxide nanoboards (Ni(OH)x NBs) with different loadings of single&#8208;atomic Ru sites (w&#8208;SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) were synthesized via a photoreduction strategy. In such catalysts, single&#8208;atomic Ru sites are anchored to the vacancies surrounding the pits. Notably, the SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x with 0.60 wt.% Ru loading (0.60&#8208;SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) exhibits the highest catalytic performance (27.6 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1) during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). Either superfluous (0.64 wt.%, 18.9 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1; 3.35 wt.%, 9.4 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1) or scarce (0.06 wt.%, 15.8 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1; 0.29 wt.%, 21.95 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1; 0.58 wt.%, 23.4 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1) of Ru sites have negative effect on its catalytic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results revealed that CO2 can be adsorbed in the pits; single&#8208;atomic Ru sites can help with the conversion of as&#8208;adsorbed CO2 and lower the energy of *COOH formation accelerating the reaction; the excessive single&#8208;atomic Ru sites occupy vacancies that retard the completion of CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Engineering the Co&#8208;Immobilization of Enzymes for Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and orderly layered co&#8208;immobilization of multiple enzymes on resin particles remain challenging. Herein, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher binding pair was fused to the N&#8208;terminus of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an aldo&#8208;keto reductase (AKR), respectively. A non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA), i.e. p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (p&#8208;AzF), as the anchor for covalent bonding enzymes, was genetically inserted into pre&#8208;selected sites in the AKR and ADH. Employing the two bioorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azido&#8208;alkynyl for the immobilization of AKR and ADH enabled the sequential dual&#8208;enzyme coating on porous microspheres. The ordered dual&#8208;enzyme reactor was subsequently used to asymmetrically synthesize (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;chlorophenyl) ethanol from the corresponding prochiral ketone, enabling the in situ regeneration of NADPH. The reactor exhibited a high catalytic conversion of 74% and good reproducibility, retaining 80% of its initial activity after six cycles. The product had an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 99.9% that was maintained in each cycle. Additionally, the double&#8208;layer immobilization method significantly increased the enzyme loading capacity, approximately 1.7 times greater than that of the traditional single&#8208;layer immobilization. More importantly, it simultaneously achieves both the purification and immobilization of multiple enzymes on carriers, thus providing a convenient approach to facilitate cascade biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Silico&#160;Screening and Experimental Verification of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Two&#8208;Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Embedding two boron atoms into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) leads to the formation of a neutral analogue that is isoelectronic to the corresponding dicationic PAH skeleton, which can significantly alter its electronic structure. Based on this concept, we explore herein the identification of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive PAHs with the aid of an&#160;in&#8208;silico&#160;screening method. Using perylene as the PAH scaffold, we embedded two boron atoms and fused two thiophene rings to it. Based on this design concept, all possible structures (~2500 entities) were generated using a comprehensive structure generator. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations were conducted on all these structures, and promising candidates were extracted based on the vertical excitation energy, transition dipole moment, and atomization energy per bond. One of the extracted dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene candidates was synthesized and indeed exhibited emission at 724 nm with a quantum yield of 0.40 in toluene, demonstrating the validity of this screening method. This modification was further applied to other PAHs, and a series of thienobora&#8208;modified PAHs was synthesized.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Embedding two boron atoms into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) leads to the formation of a neutral analogue that is isoelectronic to the corresponding dicationic PAH skeleton, which can significantly alter its electronic structure. Based on this concept, we explore herein the identification of near-infrared (NIR)-emissive PAHs with the aid of an&#160;in-silico&#160;screening method.

         <title>Differential Substrate Sensing in Terpene Synthases from Plants and Microorganisms. Insights from Structural, Bioinformatic, and EnzyDock Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene synthases (TPS) catalyze the first step in the formation of terpenoids, which comprise the largest class of natural products in nature. TPS employ a family of universal natural substrates, composed of isoprenoid units bound to a diphosphate moiety. The intricate structures generated by TPS are the result of substrate binding and folding in the active site, enzyme&#8208;controlled carbocation reaction cascades, and final reaction quenching. A key unaddressed question in class I TPS is the asymmetric nature of the diphosphate&#8208;(Mg2+)3 cluster, which forms a critical part of the active site. In this asymmetric ion&#8208;cluster, two diphosphate oxygens protrude into the active site pocket. The substrate hydrocarbon tail, which is eventually molded into terpenes, can bind to either of these oxygens, yet to which is unknown. Here, we employ structural, bioinformatics, and EnzyDock docking tools to address this enigma. We bring initial data suggesting that this difference is rooted in evolutionary differences between TPS. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to TPS originating from plants or microorganisms. We further suggest that this difference can cast light on the frequent observation that the chiral products or intermediates of plant and bacterial terpene synthases represent opposite enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Dense Supported Ruthenium Oxide Clusters via Directed Ion Exchange for Efficient Valorization of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maximizing the loading of active centers without aggregation for a supported catalyst is a grand challenge but essential for achieving high gravimetric activity, especially toward multi&#8208;step reactions. The oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a key biomass&#8208;derived platform molecule, into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a promising alternative to polyester monomer, is such a multi&#8208;step reaction that involves 6 electron transfers. Herein, we devised a strategy of creating ultra&#8208;dense supported Ru oxide clusters on a Co hydroxyanion (CoHA) support. Pyrimidine ligands were first incorporated into the CoHA interlayers, and their subsequent evacuation created porous channels for the directed ion exchange with the built&#8208;in anions in CoHA, which allows the dense and mono&#8208;disperse functionalization of RuCl62&#8208; anions and their resulting Ru oxide clusters. These ultra&#8208;dense Ru oxide clusters not only enable high HMF electrooxidation currents under neutral conditions but also create microscopic channels in&#8208;between the clusters for the expedited re&#8208;adsorption and oxidation of intermediates toward highly oxidized product, such as 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid (FFCA) and FDCA. A two&#8208;stage HMF oxidation process, consisting of ambient conversion of HMF into FFCA and FFCA oxidation into FDCA under 60 oC, was eventually developed to first achieve a high FDCA yield of 92.1% with significantly reduced polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethylation of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A Mild Functionalization and Tunable p&#8208;Type Doping Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification is a powerful strategy for tuning the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. Here we report the electrophilic trifluoromethylation of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 under mild conditions using the reagent trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TTT). Chemical characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the trifluoromethyl groups bind covalently to surface chalcogen atoms as well as oxygen substitution sites. Trifluoromethylation induces p&#8208;type doping in the underlying 2D material, enabling the modulation of charge transport and optical emission properties in WSe2. This work introduces a versatile and efficient method for tailoring the optical and electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring ROS Responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based Nanoparticle Mediated Ferroptosis&amp;Immunotherapy via 129Xe MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immune checkpoint blockade strategy has improved the survival rate of late&#8208;stage lung cancer patients. However, the low immune response rate limits the immunotherapy efficiency. Here, we report a ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based nanoparticle that undergoes charge reversal and disassembly in the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the uptake of Fe3O4 by tumor cells and triggering a more severe ferroptosis. In the tumor microenvironment, the nanoparticle rapidly disassembles and releases the loaded GOx and the immune&#8208;activating peptide Tuftsin under overexpressed H2O2. GOx can consume the glucose of tumor cells and generate more H2O2, promoting the disassembly of the nanoparticle and drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis. Combined with Tuftsin, it can more effectively reverse the immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and promote the recruitment of effector T cells in tumor tissues. Ultimately, in combination with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, there is significant inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. Additionally, the hyperpolarized 129Xe method has been used to evaluate the Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;mediated immunotherapy, where the ventilation defects in lung metastases have been significantly improved with complete lung structure and function recovered. The ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced immunotherapy combined with non&#8208;radiation evaluation methodology paves a new way for designing novel theranostic agents for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclooctatetraene&#8208;Embedded Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the prosperity of the development of carbon nanorings, certain topologically or functionally unique units&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings have sprung up in the past decade. Herein, we report the facile and efficient synthesis of three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings (COTCNRs) that contain three (COTCNR1 and COTCNR2) and four (COTCNR3) COT units in a one&#8208;pot Yamamoto coupling. These nano rings feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of Gyroid (G&#8208;), Diamond (D&#8208;), and Primitive (P&#8208;) type carbon schwarzites. The conformations of the trimeric nano rings COTCNR1 and COTCNR2 are shape&#8208;persistent, whereas the tetrameric COTCNR3 possesses a flexible carbon skeleton which undergoes conformational changes upon forming host&#8208;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70), whose co&#8208;crystals may potentially serve as fullerene&#8208;based semiconducting supramolecular wires with the electrical conductivities on the order of 10&#8722;7 S cm&#8722;1 (for C60&#8834;COTCNR3) and 10&#8722;8 S cm&#8722;1 (for C70&#8834;COTCNR3) under ambient conditions. This research not only describes highly efficient one&#8208;step syntheses to three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings which feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of distinctive topological carbon schwarzites, but also demonstrates the potential application of the one dimensional fullerenes array secured by COTCNR3 in electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Final Stages in the Biosynthesis of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The paper aims to elucidate the final stages in the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H&#160;active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases.&#160;&#160;The recently hypothesized intermediate&#160;[Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8208;&#160;([1]2&#8208;) was prepared by a multistep route from [Fe2(S2)(CN)(CO)5]&#8208;.

HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient synthesis of alkaloid frameworks with exquisite diastereoselectivity. However, a number of limitations hinder this method, primarily the strict requirement for highly electron&#8208;deficient acceptors. Herein, we present a general Lewis Acid&#8208;driven approach to address this constraint, and have developed two broad strategies enabling the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were entirely unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of the alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;tashiromine.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Prediction Leads to Synthesize GDY Supported InOx Quantum Dots for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of formic acid by direct reduction of carbon dioxide is an important basis for the future chemical industry and is of great significance. Due to the serious shortage of highly active and selective electrocatalysts leading to the development of direct reduction of carbon dioxide is limited. Herein the target catalysts with high CO2RR activity and selectivity were identified by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using graphdiyne (GDY) supported metal oxides quantum dots (QDs) as the ideal model. It is theoretically predicted that GDY supported indium oxide QDs (i.e., InOx/GDY) is a new heterostructure electrocatalyst candidate with optimal CO2RR performance. The interfacial electronic strong interactions effectively regulate the surface charge distribution of QDs and affect the adsorption/desorption behavior of HCOO* intermediate during CO2RR to achieve highly efficient CO2 conversion. Based on the predicted composition and structure, we synthesized the advanced catalytic system, and demonstrates superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion performance. The study presents an effective strategy for rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts to promote green chemical production.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co&#8208;)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long&#8208;sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. Herein, we develop well&#8208;behaved neutral phosphinophenolato nickel catalysts, which enable aqueous copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549 kDa, 0.13&#8211;1.29 mol%) in a single&#8208;component fashion under mild conditions for the first time. These copolymerization reactions occur better in water than in hydrocarbons such as toluene. The dual characteristics of high molecular weight and the incorporation of a small amount of functional group result in improved surface properties while retain the desirable intrinsic properties of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereodefined and highly substituted vinylsilanes are essential building blocks for constructing complex organic molecules. Transition metal&#8208;mediated silylmetalation of alkynes was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations; however, a very limited study was carried out to utilize transient vinylmetal species in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, they produce syn&#8208;adduct, and the anti&#8208;selective cross&#8208;coupling is still unknown and highly desired. Silylzinc reagents are highly functional group tolerant, however, their synthesis from pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts hampers cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Our novel solid silylzinc reagents circumvent these constraints are employed in the anti&#8208;selective synthesis of vinylsilanes via a multi&#8208;component reaction involving Me3SiZnI, terminal alkynes, and activated alkyl halides. An intensive computational and experimental investigation of the mechanism reveals an equilibrium between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts; the greater barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct determine the anti&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for strain&#8208;release chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes were developed to access unique SF5&#8208;cyclobutane hybrid isosteres via a polarity mismatch radical addition. Structural and mechanistic insight, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for tetrafluoro(aryl)pentafluorosulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)pentafluorosulfanylation, and three&#8208;component reactions, are also provided.







Abstract
The first assortment of achiral pentafluorosulfanylated cyclobutanes (SF5&#8208;CBs) are now synthetically accessible through strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using SF5Cl. Methods for both chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of sulfone&#8208;based BCBs are detailed herein, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the logic extends to tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanylation, and three&#8208;component pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. The methods presented enable isolation of both syn and anti isomers of SF5&#8208;CBs, but we also demonstrate that this innate selectivity can be overridden in chloropentafluorosulfanylation; that is, an anti&#8208;stereoselective variant of SF5Cl addition across sulfone&#8208;based BCBs can be achieved by using inexpensive copper salt additives. Considering the SF5 group and CBs have been employed individually as nonclassical bioisosteres, structural aspects of these unique SF5&#8208;CB &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; were then contextualized using SC&#8208;XRD. From a mechanistic standpoint, chloropentafluorosulfanylation ostensibly proceeds through a curious polarity mismatch addition of electrophilic SF5 radicals to the electrophilic sites of the BCBs. Upon examining carbonyl&#8208;containing BCBs, we also observed rare instances whereby radical addition to the 1&#8208;position of a BCB occurs. The nature of the key C(sp3)&#8722;SF5 bond formation step &#8211; among other mechanistic features of the methods we disclose &#8211; was investigated experimentally and with DFT calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate compatibility of SF5&#8208;CBs with various downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Borolithochromes A, D and G</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, spiroborate natural products possessing polyaromatic ligands, were achieved by a strategy including a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a one&#8208;pot S&#8208;methylation/intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reaction/epoxide rearrangement. A method for the synthesis of heterocomplexes possessing different multicyclic aromatic ligands is also described.







Abstract
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, red pigments isolated from fossils of Jurassic putative red alga Solenopora jurassica, have been achieved. The benzo[gh]tetraphene skeletons of the borate ligands in these substances were constructed using Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of aryl dienes with naphthoquinone, followed by intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reactions. Complexation of these ligands with trimethyl borate generated homocomplexes, which upon sequential O&#8208;demethylation produced borolithochromes A and G. In the route to borolithochrome D, a heterocomplex was prepared by stepwise complexation of the ligands with 2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl dimethyl borate. The strategy devised to accomplish the first total synthesis of borolithochromes A, D and G should be applicable to the preparation of other borolithochromes as well as spiroborates possessing two fused polycyclic aromatic ligands.

         <title>Hydrogels with Differentiated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks for Bioinspired Stress Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stress response, an intricate and autonomously coordinated reaction in living organisms, holds a reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state nature. However, existing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials often exhibit single&#8208;step and monotonous reactions due to the limited integration of structural components. Inspired by the cooperative interplay of extensor and flexor cells within Mimosa's pulvini, we present a hydrogel with differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) networks designed to enable the biological stress response. Weak H&#8208;bonding domains resemble flexor cells, confined within a hydrophobic network stabilized by strong H&#8208;bonding clusters (acting like extensor cells). Under external force, strong H&#8208;bonding clusters are disrupted, facilitating water diffusion from the bottom layer and enabling transient expansion pressure gradient along the thickness direction. Subsequently, water diffuses upward, gradually equalizing the pressure, while weak H&#8208;bonding domains undergo cooperative elastic deformation. Consequently, the hydrogel autonomously undergoes a sequence of reversible and pluralistic motion responses, similar to Mimosa's touch&#8208;triggered stress response. Intriguingly, it exhibits stress&#8208;dependent color shifts under polarized light, highlighting its potential for applications in time&#8208;sensitive "double&#8208;lock" information encryption systems. This work achieves the coordinated stress response inspired by natural tissues using a simple hydrogel, paving the way for substantial advancements in the development of intelligent soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dragocins A&#8722;C through Electrochemical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical cyclization is leveraged to forge the central 9&#8208;membered ring in the hybrid metabolites dragocins A&#8722;C. The route features several stereocontrolled reactions to address the stereotetrad of the pyrrolidine fragment and a penultimate decarboxylative chlorination and global deprotection to furnish both dragocins B and C. Dragocin A was prepared through simple methanolysis of dragocin C.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of dragocins A&#8722;C, remarkable natural products containing an unusual C4&#8217; oxidized ribose architecture bridged by a polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine, is presented through a route featuring a number of uncommon maneuvers. Several generations towards the target molecules are presented, including the spectacular failure of a key C&#8722;H oxidation on a late&#8208;stage intermediate. The final route features rapid, stereocontrolled access to a densely functionalized pyrrolidine and an unprecedented diastereoselective oxidative electrochemical cyclization to forge the hallmark 9&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary studies suggest this electrochemical oxidation protocol is generally useful.

         <title>Streamlining the Generation of Advanced Polymer Materials Through the Marriage of Automation and Multiblock Copolymer Synthesis in Emulsion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated synthesis of a wide range of unique multicompositional multiblock copolymers via emulsion polymerization is described. These include a heptablock comprising seven different methacrylates, a high molecular weight (&gt;150,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) tridecablock, and a library of multiblock copolymers with randomized degrees of polymerization, composition, and monomer order. Notably, this library includes a multiblock copolymer containing polymers from four different families (methacrylate, styreme, acrylate, and acrylamide).







Abstract
Synthetic polymers are of paramount importance in modern life &#8208; an incredibly wide range of polymeric materials possessing an impressive variety of properties have been developed to date. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence and automation presents a great opportunity to significantly speed up discovery and development of the next generation of advanced polymeric materials. We have focused on the high&#8208;throughput automated synthesis of multiblock copolymers that comprise three or more distinct polymer segments of different monomer composition bonded in linear sequence. The present work has exploited automation to prepare high molar mass multiblock copolymers (typically&gt;100,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in aqueous emulsion. A variety of original multiblock copolymers have been synthesised via a Chemspeed robot, exemplified by a multiblock copolymer comprising thirteen constituent blocks. Moreover, libraries of copolymers of randomized monomer compositions (acrylates, acrylamides, methacrylates, and styrenes), block orders, and block lengths were also generated, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our synthetic approach. One multiblock copolymer contained all four monomer families listed in the pool, which is unprecedented in the literature. The present work demonstrates that automation has the power to render complex and laborious syntheses of such unprecedented materials not just possible, but facile and straightforward, thus representing the way forward to the next generation of complex macromolecular architectures.

We disclose the development of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling method utilizing a new N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand, L8. Under optimized reaction conditions, structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl bromides underwent efficient coupling with a variety of alcohols at room temperature using an L8&#8208;based catalyst. Notably, the L8&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited enhanced activity when compared to the L4&#8208;based system previously disclosed for C&#8722;N coupling, namely the ability to functionalize aryl bromides containing acidic functional groups. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that C&#8722;O coupling utilizing L8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cu involves rate&#8208;limiting alkoxide transmetallation, resulting in a mechanism of C&#8722;O bond formation that is distinct from previously described Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, or Ni&#8208;based systems. This lower energy pathway leads to rapid C&#8722;O bond formation; a 7&#8208;fold increase relative to what is seen with other ligands. The results presented in this report overcome limitations in previously described C&#8722;O coupling methods and introduce a new ligand that we anticipate may be useful in other Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Non&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Arylation of Anisole Derivatives via Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient directing group free C&#8722;H arylation of anisoles via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a wide variety of anisole derivatives and aryl iodides and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage arylation of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize biaryl compounds without the need of the prefuctionalization of starting materials, or the installment and removal of directing groups on the substrate. A direct C&#8722;H arylation of simple arenes as limiting reactants remains a challenge. Here we disclose a non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation of anisole derivatives as limiting reagents with aryl iodides under mild reaction conditions. The arylated products are obtained in synthetically useful yields and the arylation of bioactive molecules is also demonstrated. Key to the success of this methodology is the use of a one&#8208;step synthesized S,O&#8208;ligand.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxygen Activation on Bulk Au(111) Surface Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface is revealed for the first time using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Activation of molecular oxygen on bulk Au(111) surface is found to occur via a water&#8208;promoted mechanism.







Abstract
Gaining mechanistic understanding of oxygen activation on metal surfaces is a topical area of research in surface science. However, direct investigation of on&#8208;surface oxidation processes at the nanoscale and the empirical validation of oxygen activation pathways remain challenging for the conventional analytical tools. In this study, we applied tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to gain mechanistic insights into oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface. Specifically, oxidation of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (4&#8208;ATP) to 4&#8208;nitrothiophenol (4&#8208;NTP) on Au(111) surface was investigated using hyperspectral TERS imaging. Nanoscale TERS images revealed a markedly higher oxidation efficiency in disordered 4&#8208;ATP adlayers compared to the ordered adlayers signifying that the oxidation of 4&#8208;ATP molecules proceeds via interaction with the on&#8208;surface oxidative species. These results were further validated via direct oxidation of the 4&#8208;ATP adlayers with H2O2 solution. Finally, TERS measurements of oxidized 4&#8208;ATP adlayers in the presence of H2O18 provided the first empirical evidence for the generation of oxidative species on bulk Au(111) surface via water&#8208;mediated activation of molecular oxygen. This study expands our mechanistic understanding of oxidation chemistry on bulk Au surface by elucidating the oxygen activation pathway.

         <title>Enhancing Chiroptical Responses in Helical Nanographenes via Geometric Engineering of Double [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended helical nanographenes (ED7Hs) have been synthesized where the two embedded [7]helicene units are fused at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively. The obtained ED7Hs display exceptional fivefold amplification in chiroptical responses with enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Helical nanographenes with high quantum yields and strong chiroptical responses are pivotal for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Here, we present the successful synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;extended double [7]helicenes (ED7Hs) where two helicene units are fused at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively, as the structural isomers of the reported ortho&#8208;fused ED7H. The structural geometry of these ED7Hs is clearly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Notably, this class of ED7Hs exhibits bright luminescence with high quantum yields exceeding 40&#8201;%. Through geometric regulation of two embedded [7]helicene units from ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; to para&#8208;position, these ED7Hs display exceptional amplification in chiroptical responses. This enhancement is evident in a remarkable approximate fivefold increase in the absorbance and luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs and glum), respectively, along with a boosted CPL brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, surpassing the performance of most helicene&#8208;based chiral NGs. Furthermore, DFT calculations elucidate that the geometric adjustment of two [7]helicene units allows the precise alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, leading to the observed enhancement of their chiroptical responses. This study offers an effective strategy for magnifying the CPL performance in chiral NGs, promoting their expanded application as CPL emitters.

         <title>Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Olefins using a Heterogeneous Pt&#8208;Ni Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt&#8722;Ni alloy nanocatalyst is developed for the diastereoselective directed hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold. For this substrate class, established homogeneous catalysts generate hydrogenolysis side products, and commercial heterogeneous catalysts are not stereoselective. Uniform alloying of the noble metal and base metal combined with high catalyst dispersion is critical to enabling good reactivity and diastereoselectivity for a range of sterically&#8208;hindered olefins.







Abstract
Stereoselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins is an attractive method to access compounds with two contiguous stereocenters. However, homogeneous catalysts for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation exhibit low reactivity toward tetrasubstituted olefins due to steric crowding between the ligand scaffold and the substrate. Monometallic heterogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, provide accessible surface active sites for hindered olefins but exhibit unpredictable and inconsistent stereoinduction. In this work, we develop a Pt&#8722;Ni bimetallic alloy catalyst that can diastereoselectively hydrogenate unactivated, sterically&#8208;bulky tetrasubstituted olefins, utilizing the more oxophilic Ni atoms to adsorb a hydroxyl directing group and direct facially&#8208;selective hydrogen addition to the olefin via the Pt atoms. Structure&#8208;activity studies on several Pt&#8722;Ni compositions underscore the importance of exposing a uniform PtNi alloy surface to achieve high diastereoselectivity and minimize side reactions. The optimized Pt&#8722;Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits good functional group tolerance and broad scope for tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold, generating cyclopentanol products with three contiguous stereocenters. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated in a four&#8208;step synthesis of (1R,2S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;cis&#8208;methyldihydrojasmonate with high yield and enantiopurity.

         <title>Extended Enrichment for Ultrasensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Frequency Mutations by Long Blocker Displacement Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative long blocker design for mutation hotspots detection in colorectal cancer tissue samples. Long blocker extended enrichment region offers superior enrichment capability for variants in mutation&#8208;rich areas, streamlining detection. Unlike traditional blockers, LBDA&#8208;qPCR minimizes the need for multiple entities, optimizing comprehensive mutation analysis.







Abstract
Detecting low&#8208;frequency DNA mutations hotspots cluster is critical for cancer diagnosis but remains challenging. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is constrained by sensitivity, and allele&#8208;specific PCR is restricted by throughput. Here we develop a long blocker displacement amplification (LBDA) coupled with qPCR for ultrasensitive and multiplexed variants detection. By designing long blocker oligos to perfectly match wildtype sequences while mispairing with mutants, long blockers enable 14&#8211;44&#8197;nt enrichment regions which is 2&#8208;fold longer than normal BDA in the experiments. For wild template with a specific nucleotide, LBDA can detect different mutation types down to 0.5&#8201;% variant allele frequency (VAF) in one reaction, with median enrichment fold of 1,000 on 21&#8197;mutant DNA templates compared to the wild type. We applied LBDA&#8208;qPCR to detect KRAS and NRAS mutation hotspots, utilizing a single plex assay capable of covering 81&#8197;mutations and tested in synthetic templates and colorectal cancer tissue samples. Moreover, the mutation types were verified through Sanger sequencing, demonstrating concordance with results obtained from next generation sequencing. Overall, LBDA&#8208;qPCR provides a simple yet ultrasensitive approach for multiplexed detection of low VAF mutations hotspots, presenting a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Sulfur Conversion for Energetic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that direct one&#8208;step reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling was proposed. And the tandem electrocatalysis manipulated tunable quasi&#8208;solid sulfur redox chemistry smoothen the efficient entrapping&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion polysulfide speciation for practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The high theoretical energy density (1274&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and high safety enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries with great promise for stationary energy storage system. However, the uncontrollable solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase conversion and its associated sluggish polysulfides redox kinetics pose a great challenge in tunning the sulfur speciation pathway for practical Na&#8722;S electrochemistry. Herein, we propose a new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that control the multi&#8208;step polysulfide transformation in tandem and direct quasi&#8208;solid reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling. It is revealed that the N, P heteroatom hotspots are more favorable for catalyzing the long&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while PtNi nanocrystals manipulate the direct and full Na2S4 to Na2S low&#8208;kinetic conversion during discharging. The electrodeposited Na2S on strongly coupled PtNi and N, P&#8208;codoped carbon host is extremely electroreactive and can be readily recovered back to S8 without passivation of active species during battery recharging, which delivers a true tandem electrocatalytic quasi&#8208;solid sulfur conversion mechanism. Accordingly, stable cycling of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;package Na&#8722;S pouch cells with an attractive specific capacity of 876&#8197;mAh gS&#8722;1 and a high energy of 608&#8197;Wh kgcathode&#8722;1 (172&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the total mass of cathode and anode) at 60&#8201;&#176;C are demonstrated.

         <title>Photoluminescence Enhancement in Silica&#8208;Confined Ligand&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals by Suppression of Silanol&#8208;Induced Traps and Phase Impurities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of a high density of silanol sites induces the formation of CsPb2Br5 impurities and traps along with the crystallization of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in mesoporous silica. Silanol elimination leads to a substantial improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in the photoluminescence quantum yield of CsPbBr3 NCs confined in mesoporous silica.







Abstract
The detriments of intrinsic silanol groups in mesoporous silica to the photoluminescence (PL) of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) confined in the template have never been determined and clearly elucidated. Here, we disclose that silanol&#8208;induced Cs+ and Br&#8722; deficiencies prompt the generation of traps and CsPb2Br5 impurities. The temperature&#8208;dependent PL spectra verify the higher energetic barrier of trap states in CsPbBr3 NCs confined in silanol&#8208;rich mesoporous silica. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra reveal the trapped state mediates a broadband photoinduced absorption and long&#8208;lived decay pathway of CsPbBr3 NCs in silanol&#8208;rich templates. A remarkable improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in PL quantum yields is realized by simple silanol elimination. This work demonstrates the detrimental effects of silanol sites on the PL properties of LHP NCs impregnated in mesoporous silica and provides a new perspective for the ligand&#8208;free synthesis of high&#8208;quality LHP NCs in mesoporous templates by facile impregnation for practical applications.

         <title>Anion&#8208;modulated Ion Conductor with Chain Conformational Transformation for stabilizing Interfacial Phase of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional polymer electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries was constructed by modulating the behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) from linear to low entropy globular conformation driven by a multi&#8208;ion environment and achieving the maximum compatibility of the polymer solid electrolyte in situ&#8208;derived poly(carbonate) anionic coating with the electrodes. This work emphasizes the importance of modulating the polymer chain segment conformation for the in situ construction of the solid&#8208;state electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
In solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs), the inhomogeneous electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase layer aggravates the interfacial stability, leading to discontinuous interfacial ion/charge transport and continuous degradation of the electrolyte. Herein, we constructed an anion&#8208;modulated ionic conductor (AMIC) that enables in situ construction of electrolyte/electrode interphases for high&#8208;voltage SSLMBs by exploiting conformational transitions under multiple interactions between polymer and lithium salt anions. Anions modulate the decomposition behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) (PVC) at the electrode interface by changing the spatial conformation of the polymer chains, which further enhances ion transport and stabilizes the interfacial morphology. In addition, the AMIC weakens the &#8220;Li+&#8208;solvation&#8221; and increases Li+ vehicle sites, thereby enhancing the lithium&#8208;ion transport number (tLi+=~0.67). Consequently, Li&#8201;||&#8201;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell maintains about 85&#8201;% capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.8&#8201;% in 200 cycles at a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. This study provides a new understanding of lithium salt anions regulating polymer chain segment behavior in the solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) and highlights the importance of the ion environment in the construction of interfacial phases and ionic conduction.

A fluorous peptide amphiphile R6F shows high antibacterial effect via permeabilizing bacteria membrane, disrupting the respiratory reaction and antioxidant defense system of bacteria, and destroying the peptidoglycan in cell wall. R6F was further prepared into lipid nanoparticles and efficiently treated the MRSA&#8208;induced sepsis and wound infections with minimal side effects.







Abstract
The rising prevalence of global antibiotic resistance evokes the urgent need for novel antimicrobial candidates. Cationic lipopeptides have attracted much attention due to their strong antimicrobial activity, broad&#8208;spectrum and low resistance tendency. Herein, a library of fluoro&#8208;lipopeptide amphiphiles was synthesized by tagging a series of cationic oligopeptides with a fluoroalkyl tail via a disulfide spacer. Among the lipopeptide candidates, R6F bearing six arginine moieties and a fluorous tag shows the highest antibacterial activity, and it exhibits an interesting fluorine effect as compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated lipopeptides. The high antibacterial activity of R6F is attributed to its excellent bacterial membrane permeability, which further disrupts the respiratory chain redox stress and cell wall biosynthesis of the bacteria. By co&#8208;assembling with lipid nanoparticles, R6F showed high therapeutic efficacy and minimal adverse effects in the treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced sepsis and chronic wound infection. This work provides a novel strategy to design highly potent antibacterial peptide amphiphiles for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Nanoscale Local Contacts Enable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with 20.8&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile post&#8208;treatment method is developed to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by dynamically spin&#8208;coating 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;high efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs was obtained (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%). Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%.







Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have gained significant attention due to their excellent thermal stability and suitable band gap (~1.7&#8197;eV) for tandem solar cell applications. However, the defect&#8208;induced non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, low charge extraction efficiency, energy level mismatches, and so on render the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency inverted IPSCs remains challenging. Here, the use of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol was dynamically spin&#8208;coated on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film, which facilitates the limited etching of defect&#8208;rich subsurface layer, resulting in the formation of vertical PbI2 nanosheet structures. This enabled localized contacts between the perovskite film and the electron transport layer, suppress the recombination of electron&#8208;hole and beneficial to electron extraction. Additionally, the C=O and C=N groups in ABF effectively passivated the undercoordinated Pb2+ at grain boundaries and on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. Eventually, we achieved a champion efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%) for inverted IPSCs with enhanced stability, which is the highest value ever reported to date. Furthermore, we successfully prepared p&#8208;i&#8208;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (IPSTSCs) with an efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%. This strategy provided both fast extraction and efficient passivation at the electron&#8208;selective interface.

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase: On the Detection and Stability of the Initial Carbonyloxy Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical decarboxylation reaction pathway and spectral calculations of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyloxy radicals demonstrate that they have distinct electronic absorption properties and that the former are much more unstable. These findings pertain to a controversy on the mechanism of the photoenzyme fatty acid photodecarboxylase. They support the here reinforced experimental observation of intrinsic CO2 dissociation in &#8810;300&#8197;ps.







Abstract
In fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), light&#8208;induced formation of the primary radical product RCOO&#8901; from fatty acid RCOO&#8722; occurs in 300&#8197;ps, upon which CO2 is released quasi&#8208;immediately. Based on the hypothesis that aliphatic RCOO&#8901; (spectroscopically uncharacterized because unstable) absorbs in the red similarly to aromatic carbonyloxy radicals such as 2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzoyloxy radical (DCB&#8901;), much longer&#8208;lived linear RCOO&#8901; has been suggested recently. We performed quantum chemical reaction pathway and spectral calculations. These calculations are in line with the experimental DCB&#8901; decarboxylation dynamics and spectral properties and show that in contrast to DCB&#8901;, aliphatic RCOO&#8901; radicals a) decarboxylate with a very low energetic barrier and on the timescale of a few ps and b) exhibit little red absorption. A time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy experiment confirms very rapid, &#8810;300&#8197;ps RCOO&#8901; decarboxylation in FAP. We argue that this property is required for the observed high quantum yield of hydrocarbons formation by FAP.

         <title>Unveiling Phenoxazine's Unique Reversible Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process and Stable Redox Intermediates for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox process of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolytes, a noteworthy departure from its less reversible second oxidation process in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Laying the foundation of phenoxazine for realizing multi&#8208;electron storage capacities in high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.







Abstract
The low specific capacity determined by the limited electron transfer of p&#8208;type cathode materials is the main obstruction to their application towards high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). To overcome this challenge, boosting multi&#8208;electron transfer is essential for improving the charge storage capacity. Here, as a typical heteroaromatic p&#8208;type material, we unveil the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox properties of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolytes for the first time. The second oxidation process is stabilized in the aqueous electrolytes, a notable contrast to its less reversibility in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. A comprehensive investigation of the redox chemistry mechanism demonstrates remarkably stable redox intermediates, including a stable cation radical PNO&#8901;+ characterized by effective electron delocalization and a closed&#8208;shell state dication PNO2+. Meanwhile, the heightened aromaticity contributes to superior structural stability during the redox process, distinguishing it from phenazine, which features a non&#8208;equivalent hybridized sp2&#8208;N motif. Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the PNO electrodes deliver a high capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to other p&#8208;type materials, and impressive long cycling stability with 100&#8201;% capacity retention over 3500&#8197;cycles. This work marks a crucial step forward in advanced organic electrodes based on multi&#8208;electron transfer phenoxazine moieties for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Transesterification Induced Multifunctional Additives Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole dimethylphosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyltrimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. Among them, DTMSP removes H2O and HF, and DITFA promotes the dissolution of LiNO3 in carbonate electrolyte. Both DTMSP and DITFA have low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), tending to preferentially redox decompose to produce a high&#8208;quality electrode electrolyte interphase layer.







Abstract
The electrolyte chemistry is crucially important for promoting the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H2O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li+. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic&#8208;rich layer (e.g. Li3N/Li3P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high&#8208;performance electrolyte for LMBs.

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3-dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic-rich layer (e.g. Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high-performance electrolyte for LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Delivery of Charged Species using Ion&#8208;selective Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell POT&#8208;membrane nanoparticles are synthesized and characterized. By tailoring the composition of the membrane in the shell, the selective encapsulation and light&#8208;driven release of cations is demonstrated through optical and electrochemical experiments. On&#8208;off cycles of irradiation allowed for subsequent delivery/encapsulation of cations from/to the NPs, which is useful for future on&#8208;demand drug delivery nanoplatforms.







Abstract
Controlled release systems have gained considerable attention owing to their potential to deliver molecules, including ions and drugs, in a customized manner. We present a light&#8208;induced ion&#8208;transfer platform consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs, ~300&#8197;nm) with the conductive polymer poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT) in the core and a potassium (K+)&#8208;selective membrane in the shell. Owing to the photoactive nature of POT, POT NPs can be used for a dual purpose: as a host for positively charged species and as an actuator to trigger the subsequent release. POT0 and doped POT+ coexist in the core, allowing K+ encapsulation in the shell. As POT0 is photo&#8208;oxidized to POT+, K+ is released to the (aqueous) dispersion phase to preserve the neutrality of the NPs. This process is reversible and can be simultaneously assessed using the native fluorescence of POT0 and via potentiometric measurements. The NP structure and its mechanism of action were thoroughly studied with a series of control experiments and complementary techniques. Understanding the NP and its surrounding interactions will pave the way for other nanostructured systems, facilitating sophisticated applications. The delivery of ionic drugs and interference/pollutant catching for advanced sensing/restoration will be considered in future research.

         <title>Large Organic Polar Molecules Tailored Electrode Interfaces for Stable Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace of large organic polar molecules of lithium phytate was introduced to the carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, triggering a competitive solvent attraction mechanism against the solvated Li+, and tailoring both the anode and cathode interfaces with great ability to withstand stable cycling of high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are deemed as ones of the most promising energy storage devices for next electrification applications. However, the uneven Li electroplating process caused by the diffusion&#8208;limited Li+ transportation at the Li metal surface inherently promotes the formation of dendritic morphology and instable Li interphase, while the sluggish Li+ transfer kinetic can also cause lithiation&#8208;induced stress on the cathode materials suffering from serious structural stability. Herein, a novel electrolyte designing strategy is proposed to accelerate the Li+ transfer by introducing a trace of large organic polar molecules of lithium phytate (LP) without significantly altering the electrolyte structure. The LP molecules can afford a competitive solvent attraction mechanism against the solvated Li+, enhancing both the bulk and interfacial Li+ transfer kinetic, and creating better anode/cathode interfaces to suppress the side reactions, resulting in much improved cycling efficiency of LMBs. Using LP&#8208;based electrolyte, the performance of LMB pouch cell with a practical capacity of ~1.5&#8197;Ah can be improved greatly. This strategy opens up a novel electrolyte designing route for reliable LMBs.

         <title>Activating Interfacial Electron Redistribution in Lattice&#8208;Matched Biphasic Ni3N&#8208;Co3N for Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production via Coupled Hydrazine Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn functions as an electric field engine, activating electronic redistribution at the interface of Ni3N&#8208;Co3N with highly lattice&#8208;matched lattices, thereby enabling energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production coupled with hydrazine degradation.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;purity and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density green hydrogen through water electrolysis holds immense promise, but issues such as electrocatalyst costs and power consumption have hampered its practical application. In this study, we present a promising solution to these challenges through the use of a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production via coupled hydrazine degradation. The biphasic metal nitrides with highly lattice&#8208;matched structures are deliberately constructed, forming an enhanced local electric field between the electron&#8208;rich Ni3N and electron&#8208;deficient Co3N. Additionally, Mn is introduced as an electric field engine to further activate electron redistribution. Our Mn@Ni3N&#8208;Co3N/NF bifunctional electrocatalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade current densities of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.49&#8197;V without degradation, saving at least 53.3&#8201;% energy consumption compared to conventional alkaline water electrolysis. This work will stimulate the further development of metal nitride electrocatalysts and also provide new perspectives on low&#8208;cost hydrogen production and environmental protection.

         <title>Unlocking Four&#8208;electron Conversion in Tellurium Cathodes for Advanced Magnesium&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a magnesium aluminum chloride complex electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 additive, a four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion is initiated in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of high&#8208;performance Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. The Mg(TFSI)2 additive is uncovered to play a crucial role in facilitating Cl&#8722; dissociation and mitigating corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes.







Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) batteries hold promise as a large&#8208;scale energy storage solution, but their progress has been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Here, we address this challenge by unlocking the reversible four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of superior Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. Specifically, the classic magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte is tailored by introducing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2), which initiates the Te0/Te4+ conversion with two distinct charge&#8208;storage steps. Te cathode undergoes Te/TeCl4 conversion involving Cl&#8722; as charge carriers, during which a tellurium subchloride phase is presented as an intermediate. Significantly, the Te cathode achieves a high specific capacity of 543&#8197;mAh&#8201;gTe&#8722;1 and an outstanding energy density of 850&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgTe&#8722;1, outperforming most of the previously reported cathodes. Our electrolyte analysis indicates that the addition of Mg(TFSI)2 reduces the overall ion&#8208;molecule interaction and mitigates the strength of ion&#8208;solvent aggregation within the MACC electrolyte, which implies the facilized Cl&#8722; dissociation from the electrolyte. Besides, Mg(TFSI)2 is verified as an essential buffer to mitigate the corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes caused by the consumption of the electrolyte MgCl2 in Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion cells. These findings provide crucial insights into the development of advanced Mg&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linkable Fullerene Enables Elastic and Conductive Grain Boundaries for Efficient and Wearable Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linkable fullerene (FTAI) is applied to regulate grain boundary conductivity and elasticity for the tin&#8208;based perovskite. The introduction of FTAI not only improves the perovskite quality, passivates the grain boundary defects, and facilitates charge transfer, but also effectively enhances the mechanical stability of perovskite film, achieving high&#8208;performance rigid and wearable tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have received increasing attention due to their low toxicity, high theoretical efficiency, and potential applications as wearable devices. However, the inherent fast and uncontrollable crystallization process of tin&#8208;based perovskites results in high defect density in the film. Meanwhile, when fabricated into flexible devices, the prepared perovskite film exhibits inevitable brittleness and high Young's modulus, seriously weakening the mechanical stability. In this work, we design and synthesize a cross&#8208;linkable fullerene, thioctic acid functionalized C60 fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (FTAI), which has multiple interactions with perovskite components and can finely regulate the crystallization quality of perovskite film. The obtained perovskite film shows an increased grain size and a more matched energy level with the electron transport material, effectively improving the carrier extraction efficiency. The FTAI&#8208;based rigid device achieves a champion efficiency of 14.91&#8201;% with enhanced stability. More importantly, the FTAI located at the perovskite grain boundaries could spontaneously cross&#8208;link during the perovskite annealing process, which effectively improves the conductivity and elasticity of grain boundaries, thereby giving the film excellent bending resistance. Finally, the FTAI&#8208;based wearable device yields a record efficiency of 12.35&#8201;% and displays robust bending durability, retaining about 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 10,000 bending times.

         <title>Manipulation of the Self&#8208;Assembly Morphology by Side&#8208;Chain Engineering of Quinoxaline&#8208;Substituted Organic Photothermal Molecules for Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic molecules BQC and BQE with different substituents on the quinoxaline unit have been designed, with BQE having an ethyl group exhibiting efficient nonradiative decay. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembly property of BQE results in a textured surface and thus an efficient light&#8208;trapping system. A water&#8208;electricity cogeneration device based on BQE was fabricated and showed a water evaporation efficiency of 68&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic photothermal materials have attracted increasing attention because of their structural diversity, flexibility, and compatibility. However, their energy conversion efficiency is limited owing to the narrow absorption spectrum, strong reflection/transmittance, and insufficient nonradiative decay. In this study, two quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A&#8208;D&#8211;A&#8208;D&#8208;type molecules with ethyl (BQE) or carboxylate (BQC) substituents were synthesized. Strong intramolecular charge transfer provided both molecules with a broad absorption range of 350&#8211;1000&#8197;nm. In addition, the high reorganization energy and weak molecular packing of BQE resulted in efficient nonradiative decay. More importantly, the self&#8208;assembly of BQE leads to a textured surface and enhances the light&#8208;trapping efficiency with significantly reduced light reflection/transmittance. Consequently, BQE achieved an impressive solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency of 18.16&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;kW&#8201;m&#8722;2 irradiation with good photobleaching resistance. Based on this knowledge, the water evaporation rate of 1.2&#8197;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 was attained for the BQE&#8208;based interfacial evaporation device with an efficiency of 83&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;kW&#8201;m&#8722;2 simulated sunlight. Finally, the synergetic integration of solar&#8208;steam and thermoelectric co&#8208;generation devices based on BQE was realized without significantly sacrificing solar&#8208;steam efficiency. This underscores the practical applications of BQE&#8208;based technology in effectively harnessing photothermal energy. This study provides new insights into the molecular design for enhancing light&#8208;trapping management by molecular self&#8208;assembly, paving the way for photothermal&#8208;driven applications of organic photothermal materials.

         <title>The Influence of Ions on the Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that the type and concentration of dissolved salts dictate the thermodynamics of the electrolytic reactions of aqueous electrolytes, whereas the whole picture of the mechanism remains elusive. Besides the varying O&#8722;H bond strength, we found the essential contribution from the hydration energies of protons and hydroxides, the products of OER and HER, respectively. The findings will reshape the design principles of the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
The electrochemical stability window of water is known to vary with the type and concentration of dissolved salts. However, the underlying influence of ions on the thermodynamic stability of aqueous solutions has not been fully understood. Here, we investigated the electrolytic behaviors of aqueous electrolytes as a function of different ions. Our findings indicate that ions with high ionic potentials, i.e., charge density, promote the formation of their respective hydration structures, enhancing electrolytic reactions via an inductive effect, particularly for small cations. Conversely, ions with lower ionic potentials increase the proportion of free water molecules&#8212;those not engaged in hydration shells or hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks&#8212;leading to greater electrolytic stability. Furthermore, we observe that the chemical environment created by bulky ions with lower ionic potentials impedes electrolytic reactions by frustrating the solvation of protons and hydroxide ions, the products of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. We found that the solvation of protons plays a more substantial role than that of hydroxide, which explains a greater shift for OER than for HER, a puzzle that cannot be rationalized by the notion of varying O&#8722;H bond strengths of water. These insights will help the design of aqueous systems.

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Fluorinated Lithium Borate Main Salt Empowering Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly&#8208;fluorinated lithium borate main salt of lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB) is designed to enhance cycling performance of practical lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The superior stability of LiFPB and the as&#8208;formed favorable CEI/SEI endow LMBs (50&#8197;&#956;m of lithium anode) excellent cycling stability even under high temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) and voltage (4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) conditions without any generation of HF.







Abstract
Traditional lithium salts are difficult to meet practical application demand of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under high voltages and temperatures. LiPF6, as the most commonly used lithium salt, still suffers from notorious moisture sensitivity and inferior thermal stability under those conditions. Here, we synthesize a lithium salt of lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB) comprising highly&#8208;fluorinated and borate functional groups to address the above issues. It is demonstrated that the LiFPB shows superior thermal and electrochemical stability without any HF generation under high temperatures and voltages. In addition, the LiFPB can form a protective outer&#8208;organic and inner&#8208;inorganic rich cathode electrolyte interphase on LiCoO2 (LCO) surface. Simultaneously, the FPB&#8722; anions tend to integrate into lithium ion solvation structure to form a favorable fast&#8208;ion conductive LiBxOy based solid electrolyte interphase on lithium (Li) anode. All these fantastic features of LiFPB endow LCO (1.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2)/Li metal cells excellent cycling under both high voltages and temperatures (e.g., 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 260&#8197;cycles at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 4.45&#8197;V), and even at an extremely elevated temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the important role of salt anions in determining the electrochemical performance of LMBs at both high temperature and voltage conditions.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Probe for High Spatial Quantitative Imaging of Tumor Nitric Oxide in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that spatial quantification of in vivo NO dynamics is possible using a photoacoustic probe with absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared window as the imaging agent. We have clarified the &#8220;double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword&#8221; function of NO plays in pathophysiology by pinpointing an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm3 for NO, and unveiled the possibility of NO&#8208;mediated communication between the tumor and the liver.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) exhibits both pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;tumor effects. Therefore, real&#8208;time in vivo imaging and quantification of tumor NO dynamics are essential for understanding the conflicting roles of NO played in pathophysiology. The current molecular probes, however, cannot provide high&#8208;resolution imaging in deep tissues, making them unsuitable for these purposes. Herein, we designed a photoacoustic probe with an absorption maximum beyond 1000&#8197;nm for high spatial quantitative imaging of in vivo tumor NO dynamics. The probe exhibits remarkable sensitivity, selective ratiometric response behavior, and good tumor&#8208;targeting abilities, facilitating ratiometric imaging of tumor NO throughout tumor progression in a micron&#8208;resolution level. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully quantified NO dynamics in tumor, liver and kidney. We have pinpointed an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm3 for NO, which plays a crucial role in the &#8220;double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword&#8221; function of NO in tumors. Furthermore, we revealed a reciprocal relationship between the NO concentration in tumors and that in the liver, providing initial insights into the possible NO&#8208;mediated communication between tumor and the liver. We believe that the probe will help resolve conflicting aspects of NO biology and guide the design of imaging agents for tumor diagnosis and anti&#8208;cancer drug screening.

&lt;p&gt;We report that spatial quantification of in vivo NO dynamics is possible using a photoacoustic probe with absorption in the second near-infrared window as the imaging agent. We have clarified the &#8220;double-edged-sword&#8221; function of NO plays in pathophysiology by pinpointing an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for NO, and unveiled the possibility of NO-mediated communication between the tumor and the liver.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) exhibits both pro- and anti-tumor effects. Therefore, real-time in vivo imaging and quantification of tumor NO dynamics are essential for understanding the conflicting roles of NO played in pathophysiology. The current molecular probes, however, cannot provide high-resolution imaging in deep tissues, making them unsuitable for these purposes. Herein, we designed a photoacoustic probe with an absorption maximum beyond 1000&#8197;nm for high spatial quantitative imaging of in vivo tumor NO dynamics. The probe exhibits remarkable sensitivity, selective ratiometric response behavior, and good tumor-targeting abilities, facilitating ratiometric imaging of tumor NO throughout tumor progression in a micron-resolution level. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully quantified NO dynamics in tumor, liver and kidney. We have pinpointed an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for NO, which plays a crucial role in the &#8220;double-edged-sword&#8221; function of NO in tumors. Furthermore, we revealed a reciprocal relationship between the NO concentration in tumors and that in the liver, providing initial insights into the possible NO-mediated communication between tumor and the liver. We believe that the probe will help resolve conflicting aspects of NO biology and guide the design of imaging agents for tumor diagnosis and anti-cancer drug screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonding Networks Stabilized Organic Supramolecular Cathode for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity and Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage, attributing to the abundant reserves, low cost, intrinsic safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, the cathode materials reported thus far still face challenges such as limited capacity, sluggish kinetics, and undesirable cycle life. Herein, we propose an organic cathode benzo[i] benzo[6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a] benzo [6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;5,8,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaone (BQQPH) for RABs. The six C=O and six C=N redox active sites in each molecule enable BQQPH to deliver a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. Encouragingly, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions endow BQQPH with robust structural stability and minimal solubility, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000 cycles. Moreover, the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl group induces a reduction in the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which considerably enhances both the discharge voltage and redox kinetics of BQQPH. In&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations unveil that the charge storage mechanism is reversible coordination/dissociation of AlCl2+ with the N and O sites in BQQPH accompanied by 12&#8208;electron transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials for RABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Using an Osmium Complex as a Panchromatic Self&#8208;Photosensitized Catalyst: Utilization of Blue, Green, and Red Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) represents an attractive approach for solar&#8208;energy storage and leads to the production of renewable fuels and valuable chemicals. Although some osmium (Os) photosensitizers absorb long wave&#8208;lengths in the visible&#8208;light region, a self&#8208;photosensitized, mono&#8208;nuclear Os catalyst for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction has not yet been exploited. Here, we discovered that the introduction of an Os metal to a PNNP&#8208;type tetradentate ligand resulted in the absorption of light with longer&#8208;wavelength (350&#8211;700 nm) and that can be applied to a panchromatic self&#8208;photosensitized catalyst for CO2 reduction to give mainly carbon monoxide (CO) with a total turnover number (TON) of 625 under photoirradiation (&#955; &#8805; 400 nm). CO2 photoreduction also proceeded under irradiation with blue (&#955;0 = 405 nm), green (&#955;0 = 525 nm), or red (&#955;0 = 630 nm) light to give CO with &gt;90% selectivity. The quantum efficiency using red light was determined to be 12% for the generation of CO. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on the detection of intermediates using various spectroscopic techniques, including transient absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and UV&#8722;vis spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Amine Catalysis in Enzyme Design: Broadening Protein Template Diversity through Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secondary amines, due to their reactivity, can transform protein templates into catalytically active entities, accelerating the development of artificial enzymes. However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N&#8208;terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. Here, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines, namely unnatural amino acids&#160;1&#8208;3, could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR and nucleotide&#8208;binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D&#8208;proline (1) demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro&#8208;R&#160;hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r.&#160;up to 92:8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis.&#160;Due to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR&#8208;based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mercury&#8208;Group 13 Metal Covalent Bonds: A Systematic Comparison of Aluminyl, Gallyl and Indyl Metallo&#8208;ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic compounds containing direct metal&#8208;group 13 element bonds have been shown to display unprecedented patterns of cooperative reactivity towards small molecules, which can be influenced by the identity of the group 13 element. In this context, we present here a systematic appraisal of group 13 metallo&#8208;ligands of the type [(NON)E]&#8208;&#160;(NON =&#160;4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) for E = Al, Ga and In, through a comparison of structural and spectroscopic parameters associated with the&#160;trans&#160;L or X ligands in linear&#160;d10&#160;complexes of the types LM{E(NON)} and XM'{E(NON)}. These studies are facilitated by convenient syntheses (from the In(I) precursor, InCp) of the potassium indyl species [{K(NON)In}&#183;KCp]n&#160;(1) and [(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)2K2Cp] [(NON)In] (1'), and lead to the first structural characterisation of Ag&#8211;In and Hg&#8211;E (E = Al, In) covalent bonds. The resulting structural, spectroscopic and quantum chemical probes of Ag/Hg complexes are consistent with markedly stronger&#160;sigma&#8208;donor capabilities of the aluminyl ligand, [(NON)Al]&#8208;, over its gallium and indium counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Network Polymer Properties Engineered through Polymer Backbone Dispersity and Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dispersity (&#393; or Mw/Mn) is an important parameter in material design and as such can significantly impact the properties of polymers. Here polymer networks with independent control over the molecular weight and dispersity of the linear chains that form the material are developed. Using a RAFT polymerization approach a library of polymers with dispersity ranging from 1.2&#8208;1.9 for backbone chain&#8208;length (DP) 100, and 1.4&#8208;3.1 for backbone chain&#8208;length 200 were developed and transformed to networks through post&#8208;polymerization crosslinking to form disulfide linkers. The tensile, swelling, and adhesive properties were explored, finding that both at DP 100 and DP 200 the swelling ratio, tensile strength, and extensibility were superior at intermediate dispersity (1.3&#8208;1.5 for DP 100 and 1.6&#8208;2.1 for DP 200) compared to materials with either substantially higher or lower dispersity. Furthermore, adhesive properties for materials with chains of intermediate dispersity at DP 200 revealed enhanced performance compared to the very low or high dispersity chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Isomerization of Borylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes Enabled by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Configurationally&#8208;defined dienes are pervasive across the bioactive natural product spectrum, where they typically manifest themselves as sorbic acid&#8208;based fragments. These C5 motifs reflect the biosynthesis algorithms that facilitate their construction. To complement established biosynthetic paradigms, a chemical platform to facilitate the construction of stereochemically defined, functionalizable dienes by light&#8208;enabled isomerization has been devised. Enabled by selective energy transfer catalysis, a variety of substituted &#946;&#8208;boryl sorbic acid derivatives can be isomerized in a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner (up to 99:1). Directionality is guided by a stabilizing nO &#8594; pB interaction in the product: this constitutes a formal anti&#8208;hydroboration of the starting alkyne. This operationally simple reaction employs low catalyst loadings (1 mol%) and is complete in 1 h. X&#8208;ray analysis supports the hypothesis that the nO &#8594; pB interaction leads to chromophore bifurcation: this provides a structural foundation for selective energy transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Cascade Cationic Insertion in Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and dissymmetry factor (glum) is difficult due to usually unmatched electric transition dipole moment (&#181;) and magnetic transition dipole moment (m) of materials. Herein we tackle this issue by playing a &#8220;cascade cationic insertion&#8221; trick to achieve strong CPL (with PLQY of ~ 100%) in lead&#8208;free metal halides with high glum values reaching &#8208;2.3&#215;10&#8208;2 without using any chiral inducers. Achiral solvents of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) infiltrate the crystal lattice via asymmetric hydrogen bonding, distorting the perovskite structure to induce the &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; chirality. Surprisingly, additional insertion of Cs+ cation to substitute partial (CH3)2NH2+ transforms the chiral space group to achiral but the crystal maintains chiroptical activity. Further doping of Sb3+ stimulates strong photoluminescence as a result of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) formation without disturbing the crystal framework. The chiral perovskites of indium&#8208;antimony chlorides embedded on LEDs chips demonstrate promising potential as CPL emitters. Our work presents rare cases of chiroptical activity of highly luminescent perovskites from only achiral building blocks via spontaneous resolution as a result of symmetry breaking.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;chiral Nonlinear Optical Effect with Large Anisotropic Response in Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiral organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are vital candidates for superior nonlinear optical (NLO) effects associated with circularly polarized (CP) light. NLO in chiral materials often couples with magnetic dipole (MD) transition, as well as the conventional electric dipole (ED) transition. However, the importance of MD transition in NLO process of chiral OIHPs has not yet been well recognized. Here, the circular polarized probe analysis of second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) provides the direct evidence that the contribution of MD leads to a large anisotropic response to CP lights in chiral OIHPs, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBACl)2PbI4. The thin films exhibit great sensitivity to CP lights over a wide wavelength range, and the g&#8208;value reaches up to 1.57 at the wavelength where the contribution of MD is maximized. Furthermore, it is also effective as CP light generator, outputting CP&#8208;SHG with maximum g&#8208;factor of 1.76 upon the stimulation of linearly polarized light. This study deepens the understanding of relation between chirality and magneto&#8208;optical effect, and such an efficient discrimination and generation of CP light signal is highly applicable for chirality&#8208;based sensor and optical communication devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism in&#160;Carbonic Acid through Direct Synthesis from&#160;Carbon Dioxide Clathrate Hydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is widespread in astrochemically relevant environments, often&#160;coexisting with water (H2O) ices and thus triggering a great interest regarding the
possible formation of their adducts under various thermodynamic conditions. Amongst&#160;them, solid carbonic acid (H2CO3) remains elusive, yet being widely studied. Synthetic
routes followed for its production have always been characterised by drastic irradiation&#160;on solid ice mixtures or complex procedures on fluid samples (such as laser heating at
moderate to high pressures). Here we report about a simpler yet effective synthetic route&#160;to obtain two diverse carbonic acid crystal structures from the fast, cold compression
of pristine CO2 clathrate hydrate samples. The two distinct polymorphs we obtained,&#160;differing in the water content, have been deeply characterised via spectroscopic and
structural techniques to assess their composition and their astonishing pressure stability,&#160;checked up to half a megabar, also highlighting the complex correlations between them
so to compile a detailed phase diagram of this system. These results may have a&#160;profound impact on the prediction and modelisation of the complex chemistry which
characterises many icy bodies of our Solar System.</dc:description>

         <title>Interphase Engineering via Solvent Molecule Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal battery has been regarded as promising next&#8208;generation battery system aiming for higher energy density. However, the lithium metal anode suffers severe side&#8208;reaction and dendrite issues. Its electrochemical performance is significantly depended&#160;on the electrolyte components and solvation structure. Herein, a series of fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect&#160;derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.76%)&#160;enables remarkable CE of 99.71% (25 &#8451;) as well as high CE of 98.56% even at &#8208;20 &#8451;. Moreover, the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery exhibits excellent performance in a wide temperature range&#160;(&#8208;20 to 50&#160;&#8451;) ascribed to the modified interphase rich in LiF/LiO2. Furthermore, the pouch cell delivers superior energy density of 344.4 Wh kg&#8208;1 and maintains 80% capacity retention after 50 cycles. The novel solvent design via molecule chemistry provides alternative strategy to adjust solvation structure and thus favors high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chelating Additive Regulating Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry for Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) usually suffered from poor reversibility and limited lifespan because of serious water induced side&#8208;reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and rampant zinc (Zn) dendrite growth. Reducing the content of water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths can effectively suppress those inherent defects of AZMBs. In this work, we originally discovered that the two carbonyl groups of N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactam (N&#8208;ac) chelating ligand can serve as dual solvation sites to coordinate with Zn2+, thereby minimizing water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths, and greatly inhibit water&#8208;induced side&#8208;reactions and HER. Moreover, the N&#8208;ac chelating additive can form a unique physical barrier interface on Zn surface, preventing the harmful contacting with water. In addition, the preferential adsorption of N&#8208;ac on Zn (002) facets can promote highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn2+ deposition. As a result, Zn//Cu half&#8208;cell within N&#8208;ac added electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;high 99.89% Coulombic efficiency during 8000 cycles. Zn//Zn symmetric cells also demonstrated unprecedented long life of more than 9800 hours (over one year). Aqueous Zn//ZnV6O16&#183;8H2O (Zn//ZVO) full&#8208;cell preserved 78% capacity even after ultra&#8208;long 2000 cycles. A more practical pouch&#8208;cell was also obtained (90.2% capacity after 100 cycles). This method offers a promising strategy for accelerating the development of highly efficient AZMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Cyanoketenyl Anion [NC3O]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and gram&#8208;scale isolation of the elusive cyanoketenyl anion [NC3O]&#8722; is reported. Despite its cumulene&#8208;like structure, it exhibits a bent geometry in the solid state, which is also confirmed by computational studies. The cyanoketenyl anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules such as CO2, H2O or NH3 to form more complex organic compounds, including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate.







Abstract
Cumulenes and heterocumulenes with three or more cumulative multiple bonds are usually reactive species that serve as valuable building blocks for more complex molecules but tend to isomerize or cyclize and therefore are difficult to isolate. Using a mild ligand exchange reaction at the carbon in &#945;&#8208;metalated ylides, we have now succeeded in the synthesis and gram&#8208;scale isolation of the elusive cyanoketenyl anion [NC3O]&#8722;. Despite its assumed cumulene&#8208;like structure and the delocalization of the negative charge across the whole 5&#8208;atom molecule, it features a bent geometry with a nucleophilic central carbon atom. Computational studies reveal an ambiguous bonding situation in the anion, which can be illustrated only by a combination of different resonance structures. Nonetheless, the anion features remarkable stability, thus allowing the storage of its potassium&#8208;crown ether salt and its application as a highly functional synthetic building block. The cyanoketenyl anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules to form more complex organic compounds, including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate. This work demonstrated that reactive species can be generated by novel synthesis methods and open up atom&#8208;economic pathways to complex compounds from small abundant molecules.

         <title>Correlation between Heteroatom Coordination and Hydrogen Evolution for Single&#8208;site Pt on Carbon&#8208;based Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Pt single&#8208;site catalysts was constructed and exhibited increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along the S&#8208;, P&#8208;, C&#8208; and N&#8208;coordinated Pt. The structure&#8208;performance correlation is established. The multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption deepens the understanding of activity and stability. The density of states (DOS) of Pt 5d orbitals near Fermi level (Ef) can promote the activity by facilitating electron transfer and proton capture.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic performance of single&#8208;site catalysts (SSCs) is closely correlated with the electronic structure of metal atoms. Herein we construct a series of Pt SSCs on heteroatom&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, which exhibit increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along S&#8208;doped, P&#8208;doped, undoped and N&#8208;doped supports. Theoretical simulation indicates a multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process on Pt SSCs due to the low coordination, and a reasonable descriptor is figured out to evaluate the HER activities. Relative to C&#8208;coordinated Pt, N&#8208;coordinated Pt has higher reactivity due to the electron transfer of N&#8208;to&#8208;Pt, which enriches the density of states of Pt 5d orbital near the Fermi level and facilitates the capturing of protons, just the opposite to the situations for P&#8208; and S&#8208;coordinated ones. The stable N&#8208;coordinated Pt originates from the kinetic stability throughout the multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process. This finding provides a significant guidance for rational design of advanced Pt SSCs on carbon&#8208;based supports.

         <title>Unlocking Amides: A General Method for the Self&#8208;Immolative Release of Amide&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methodologies for the self&#8208;immolative release of amide motifs remain scarce despite the prevalence of amides in molecules. Herein, is presented a general and comprehensive strategy for the selective release of a diverse range of amides using a range of common triggers. A stable prodrug of the FDA approved antibiotic linezolid showcased the method and exhibited selective release and equipotency to free linezolid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.







Abstract
The controlled liberation of molecules from a constructed framework is a subject of profound interest across various chemical fields. It allows for the masking of a molecule's properties and precise deployment upon a single controllable release event. While numerous methodologies have been developed for amines, alcohols, and thiols, approaches for utilising amides as payload&#8208;release handles are still in their early stages of development, despite the prevalence of amides in therapeutic compounds and materials. Herein, is presented a comprehensive strategy for the controlled and selective release of a diverse range of amides with stable linkers. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated by its successful application in the targeted release of various amide&#8208;containing drugs in their natural form via the use of commonly used trigger motifs, such as dipeptides or glycosides. As a proof of concept, the FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic linezolid has been successfully converted into a prodrug form and released selectively only in the presence of the trigger event. Significantly, in its prodrug state, no activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was exhibited. Linezolid's full potential was achieved only upon controlled release, where an equipotent efficacy to the free linezolid control was demonstrated, thus emphasising the immense potential of this method.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of Cell&#8208;Surface Proteins via Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy by Using Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy for targeted degradation of cell&#8208;surface proteins with an antibody&#8211;peptide conjugate (Ab&#8208;CMA) is reported, in which a peptide targeting chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) was conjugated with commercially available antibodies for CMA&#8208;based lysosomal degradation of the corresponding antigen independent of specific cell&#8208;surface receptors or E3 ligases, with useful implications for both biochemical research and for therapeutics.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;surface proteins are important drug targets but historically have posed big challenges for the complete elimination of their functions. Herein, we report antibody&#8211;peptide conjugates (Ab&#8208;CMAs) in which a peptide targeting chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) was conjugated with commercially available monoclonal antibodies for specific cell&#8208;surface protein degradation by taking advantage of lysosomal degradation pathways. Unique features of Ab&#8208;CMAs, including cell&#8208;surface receptor&#8208; and E3 ligase&#8208;independent degradation, feasibility towards different cell&#8208;surface proteins (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand&#8197;1 (PD&#8208;L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)) by a simple change of the antibody, and successful tumor inhibition in vivo, make them attractive protein degraders for biomedical research and therapeutic applications. As the first example employing CMA to degrade proteins from the outside in, our findings may also shed new light on CMA, a degradation pathway typically targeting cytosolic proteins.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upcycling and Depolymerization of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As environmental concerns associated with the ultimate fate of polymers grow, researchers are exploring methods to enhance the recycling and sustainability of these ubiquitous materials. Enhanced upcycling, degradation and depolymerization strategies have recently been achieved via photocatalysis and are summarized in this Mini Review.







Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling and depolymerization of vinyl polymers have emerged as promising strategies to combat plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. This mini review critically summarizes current developments in the upcycling and degradation of vinyl polymers including polystyrene and poly(meth)acrylates. Of these material classes, polymethacrylates possess the unique possibility to undergo a photocatalytic depolymerization back to monomer under thermodynamically favourable conditions, thus presenting significant advantages over traditional thermal strategies. Our perspective on current formidable challenges and potential future directions are also discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell, Single&#8208;Mitochondrial DNA Assay Using Hydrogel Droplet Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While understanding mtDNA heteroplasmy and intercellular heterogeneity requires single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis, existing methods restrict studies to small cell populations. We present a high&#8208;throughput, multiplex method for single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mtDNA analysis using rolling circle amplification and hydrogel droplet microfluidics.







Abstract
There is growing interest in understanding the biological implications of single cell heterogeneity and heteroplasmy of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but current methodologies for single&#8208;cell mtDNA analysis limit the scale of analysis to small cell populations. Although droplet microfluidics have increased the throughput of single&#8208;cell genomic, RNA, and protein analysis, their application to sub&#8208;cellular organelle analysis has remained a largely unsolved challenge. Here, we introduce an agarose&#8208;based droplet microfluidic approach for single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mtDNA analysis, which allows simultaneous processing of hundreds of individual mtDNA molecules within &gt;10,000 individual cells. Our microfluidic chip encapsulates individual cells in agarose beads, designed to have a sufficiently dense hydrogel network to retain mtDNA after lysis and provide a robust scaffold for subsequent multi&#8208;step processing and analysis. To mitigate the impact of the high viscosity of agarose required for mtDNA retention on the throughput of microfluidics, we developed a parallelized device, successfully achieving ~95&#8201;% mtDNA retention from single cells within our microbeads at &gt;700,000 drops/minute. To demonstrate utility, we analyzed specific regions of the single&#8208;mtDNA using a multiplexed rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay. We demonstrated compatibility with both microscopy, for digital counting of individual RCA products, and flow cytometry for higher throughput analysis.

         <title>Second Generation Catalytic Enantioselective Nucleophilic Desymmetrization at Phosphorus (V): Improved Generality, Efficiency and Modularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates.







Abstract
A broadly improved second generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds is described. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a wide range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) containing compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates. A new ureidopeptide BIMP catalyst/thiaziolidinone leaving group combination allowed for a far wider substrate scope and increased reaction efficiency and practicality over previously established protocols. The resulting enantioenriched intermediates could then be transformed into an even greater range of distinct classes of P(V) compounds by displacement of the remaining leaving group as well as allowing for even further diversification downstream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to pinpoint the origin of enantioselectivity for the BIMP&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization, to rationalize how a superior catalyst/leaving group combination leads to increased generality in our second&#8208;generation catalytic system, as well as shed light onto observed stereochemical retention and inversion pathways when performing late&#8208;stage enantiospecific SN2@P reactions with Grignard reagents.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Tailored PVDF&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residual DMF solvents in PVDF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes suffered from inevitably serious side reactions with high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode and lithium metal anode which restrict the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state Li||NCM811 cells. We proposed a novel strategy of anchoring DMF solvents by incorporating low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite molecular sieves as fillers to modulate the solvation structures in PVDF&#8208;based solid state electrolyte. Inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and CEI derived from the tailored anion&#8208;rich solvated structure guarantee long&#8208;term cycling stability of the solid&#8208;state Li||NCM811&#8197;cell at high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3&#8197;V and 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based polymer electro&#8208;lytes are attracting increasing attention for high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries because of their high room temperature ionic conductivity, adequate mechanical strength and good thermal stability. However, the presence of highly reactive residual solvents, such as N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), severely jeopardizes the long&#8208;term cycling stability. Herein, we propose a solvation&#8208;tailoring strategy to confine residual solvent molecules by introducing low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite molecular sieves as fillers. The strong interaction between DMF and the molecular sieve weakens the ability of DMF to participate in the solvation of Li+, leading to more anions being involved in solvation. Benefiting from the tailored anion&#8208;rich coordination environment, the interfacial side reactions with the lithium anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode are effectively suppressed. As a result, the solid&#8208;state Li||Li symmetrical cells demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 5100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li||NCM811 full cells achieve excellent cycling stability for more than 1130 and 250 cycles under the charging cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3&#8197;V and 4.5&#8197;V, respectively. Our work is an innovative exploration to address the negative effects of residual DMF in PVDF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes and highlights the importance of modulating the solvation structures in solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Macrocyclic Dual&#8208;Locked &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; Drug for Selective and Traceless Release in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked approach to embed a small&#8208;molecule drug in a cyclic structure to control bioactivity is described, with the possibility to introduce cell&#8208;targeting entities. Selective and traceless release of the active drug occurs under intracellular conditions found in cancer cells owing to the dual lock and targeting entities.







Abstract
Drug safety and efficacy due to premature release into the bloodstream and poor biodistribution remains a problem despite seminal advances in this area. To circumvent these limitations, we report drug cyclization based on dynamic covalent linkages to devise a dual lock for the small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, camptothecin (CPT). Drug activity is &#8220;locked&#8221; within the cyclic structure by the redox responsive disulfide and pH&#8208;responsive boronic acid&#8208;salicylhydroxamate and turns on only in the presence of acidic pH, reactive oxygen species and glutathione through traceless release. Notably, the dual&#8208;responsive CPT is more active (100&#8208;fold) than the non&#8208;cleavable (permanently closed) analogue. We further include a bioorthogonal handle in the backbone for functionalization to generate cyclic&#8208;locked, cell&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208; and protein&#8208;CPTs, for targeted delivery of the drug and traceless release in triple negative metastatic breast cancer cells to inhibit cell growth at low nanomolar concentrations.

         <title>Engineering NH2&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH2 Triple&#8208;atom Sites in Defective MOFs for Selective Overall Photoreduction of CO2 into CH3COCH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced Cu2+ into the connected nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (Cu&#8208;MOF) and formed special NH2&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH2 catalytic sites for photocatalytic H2O splitting and selective CO2 reduction into acetone. Two amino groups and Cu sites synergistically captured the CO2 molecules and stabilized and decreased the activation energy barriers of the *CO, *CH3, *COCH3, and *COCOCH3 key species, which ultimately produced the C3 product. Finally, Cu&#8208;MOF efficiently converted H2O and CO2 into CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivities up to 97.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Selective photoreduction of CO2 to multicarbon products, is an important but challenging task, due to high CO2 activation barriers and insufficient catalytic sites for C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, a defect engineering strategy for incorporating copper sites into the connected nodes of defective metal&#8211;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for selective overall photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 into acetone. The Cu2+ site in well&#8208;modified CuN2O2 units served as a trapping site to capture electrons via efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, forming the active Cu+ site for CO2 reduction. Two NH2 groups in CuN2O2 unit adsorb CO2 and cooperated with copper ion to functionalize as a triple atom catalytic site, each interacting with one CO2 molecule to strengthen the binding of *CO intermediate to the catalytic site. The deoxygenated *CO attached to the Cu site interacted with *CH3 fixed at one amino group to form the key intermediate CO*&#8208;CH3, which interacted with the third reduction intermediate on another amino group to produce acetone. Our photocatalyst realizes efficient overall CO2 reduction to C3 product acetone CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity up to 97&#8201;% without any adducts, offering a promising avenue for designing triple&#8208;atomic sites to producing C3 product from photosynthesis with water.

         <title>Reductive Doping Inhibits the Formation of Isomerization&#8208;Derived Structural Defects in N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive doping effectively prevents the creation of defects caused by structural changes (isomerization) during the production of n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF). This process involves several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, the integer charge transfer, or the formation of charge transfer complexes, to stop structural isomerization.







Abstract
Recently, solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has been made through in&#8208;situ oxidative polymerization and reductive doping, which exhibited exceptionally high electrical conductivities and optical transparency. The discovery of n&#8208;PBDF is considered a breakthrough in the field of organic semiconductors. In the initial report, the possibility of structural defect formation in n&#8208;PBDF was proposed, based on the observation of structural isomerization from (E)&#8208;2H,2&#8242;H&#8208;[3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuranylidene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dione (isoxindigo) to chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]chromene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione (dibenzonaphthyrone) in the dimer model reactions. In this study, we present clear evidence that structural isomerization is inhibited during polymerization. We reveal that the dimer (BFD1) and the trimer (BFD2) can be reductively doped by several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, forming charge transfer complexes (CTC) or undergoing an integer charge transfer (ICT) with reactants available during polymerization. Once the hydride transfer adducts, the CTC, or the ICT product forms, structural isomerization can be effectively prevented even at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of why isomerization&#8208;derived structural defects are absent in n&#8208;PBDF backbone. It lays a solid foundation for the future development of n&#8208;PBDF as a benchmark polymer for organic electronics and beyond.

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Programmed Biosynthesis of Heterotrimeric Fungal Depside Thielavin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyketide synthase ThiA that forms the heterotrimeric fungal depside thielavin A (1) has been identified and characterized. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ThiA was found to perform two consecutive esterification reactions as well as subsequent hydrolysis, and a plausible reaction mechanism for the TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions has been proposed. Furthermore, this study provides insights into how ThiA selectivity yields the heterotrimeric product.







Abstract
Thielavin A (1) is a fungal depside composed of one 3&#8208;methylorsellinic acid and two 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid units. It displays diverse biological activities. However, the mechanism underlying the assembly of the heterotrimeric structure of 1 remains to be clarified. In this study, we identified the polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of 1. This PKS, designated as ThiA, possesses an unusual domain organization with the C&#8208;methyltransferase (MT) domain situated at the C&#8208;terminus following the thioesterase (TE) domain. Our findings indicated that the TE domain is solely responsible for two rounds of ester bond formation, along with subsequent chain hydrolysis. We identified a plausible mechanism for TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions and obtained insights into how a single PKS can selectively yield a specific heterotrimeric product. In particular, the tandem acyl carrier protein domains of ThiA are critical for programmed methylation by the MT domain. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence of highly optimized domain&#8211;domain communication within ThiA for the selective synthesis of 1, which can advance our understanding of the programming rules of fungal PKSs.

The thioesterase (TE) domain of ThiA was found to perform two consecutive esterification reactions as well as subsequent hydrolysis, and a plausible reaction mechanism for the TE-catalyzed reactions has been proposed. Furthermore, this study provides insights into how ThiA selectivity yields the heterotrimeric product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thielavin A (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is a fungal depside composed of one 3-methylorsellinic acid and two 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid units. It displays diverse biological activities. However, the mechanism underlying the assembly of the heterotrimeric structure of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; remains to be clarified. In this study, we identified the polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. This PKS, designated as ThiA, possesses an unusual domain organization with the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase (MT) domain situated at the C-terminus following the thioesterase (TE) domain. Our findings indicated that the TE domain is solely responsible for two rounds of ester bond formation, along with subsequent chain hydrolysis. We identified a plausible mechanism for TE-catalyzed reactions and obtained insights into how a single PKS can selectively yield a specific heterotrimeric product. In particular, the tandem acyl carrier protein domains of ThiA are critical for programmed methylation by the MT domain. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence of highly optimized domain&#8211;domain communication within ThiA for the selective synthesis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, which can advance our understanding of the programming rules of fungal PKSs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Degradable Polymers from Tricycloalkenes via Complete Cascade Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
we disclosed a complete cascade RORCMP using tricycloalkenes. We found trans tricycloalkenes enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP with TON ~10,000 and Mn up to 170&#8197;kg/mol. Also, one&#8208;shot cascade MOMP was achieved to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation.







Abstract
Cascade metathesis polymerization has been developed as a promising method to synthesize complex but well&#8208;defined polymers from monomers containing multiple reactive functional groups. However, this approach has been limited to the monomers involving simple alkene/alkyne moieties or produced mainly non&#8208;degradable polymers. In this study, we demonstrate a complete cascade ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization (RORCMP) using various tricycloalkenes and two strategies for the efficient degradation. Through rational design of tricycloalkene monomers, the structure and reactivity relationship was explored. For example, tricycloalkenes with trans configuration in the central ring enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP than the corresponding cis isomers. Also, a 4&#8208;substituted cyclopentene moiety in the monomers significantly enhanced the overall cascade RORCMP performance, with the maximum turnover number (TON) reaching almost 10,000 and molecular weight up to 170&#8197;kg/mol using an amide&#8208;containing monomer. Furthermore, we achieved one&#8208;shot cascade multiple olefin metathesis polymerization using tricycloalkenes and a diacrylate, to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we successfully designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation under mild conditions.

         <title>Engineering Biocatalysts for the C&#8722;H Activation of Fatty Acids by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of biocatalysts for the regioselective mid&#8208; and end&#8208;chain C&#8722;H activation of fatty acids to generate hydroxy acids is described. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was successfully applied to the multidomain enzyme family of CYP116B cytochrome P450 monooxygenases to generate ancestor variants with distinct product and thermostability profiles.







Abstract
Selective, one&#8208;step C&#8722;H activation of fatty acids from biomass is an attractive concept in sustainable chemistry. Biocatalysis has shown promise for generating high&#8208;value hydroxy acids, but to date enzyme discovery has relied on laborious screening and produced limited hits, which predominantly oxidise the subterminal positions of fatty acids. Herein we show that ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is an effective tool to explore the sequence&#8208;activity landscape of a family of multidomain, self&#8208;sufficient P450 monooxygenases. We resurrected 11 catalytically active CYP116B ancestors, each with a unique regioselectivity fingerprint that varied from subterminal in the older ancestors to mid&#8208;chain in the lineage leading to the extant, P450&#8208;TT. In lineages leading to extant enzymes in thermophiles, thermostability increased from ancestral to extant forms, as expected if thermophily had arisen de novo. Our studies show that ASR can be applied to multidomain enzymes to develop active, self&#8208;sufficient monooxygenases as regioselective biocatalysts for fatty acid hydroxylation.

         <title>Accessing Mg&#8208;Ion Storage in V2PS10 via Combined Cationic&#8208;Anionic Redox with Selective Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
V2PS10 achieves reversible capacity of 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with fast Mg2+ insertion kinetics. Insertion is accompanied by simultaneous anionic and cationic redox on spatially separated sites. The nature of the electron transfer depends on the coordination of individual Mg sites by the distinct sulphur species involved, creating synergy between specific site occupancies and the selective cleavage of one of the two chemically distinct sets of S&#8722;S bonds.







Abstract
Magnesium batteries attract interest as alternative energy&#8208;storage devices because of elemental abundance and potential for high energy density. Development is limited by the absence of suitable cathodes, associated with poor diffusion kinetics resulting from strong interactions between Mg2+ and the host structure. V2PS10 is reported as a positive electrode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries. Cyclable capacity of 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved with fast Mg2+ diffusion of 7.2
10&#8722;11&#8211;4
10&#8722;14&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1. The fast insertion mechanism results from combined cationic redox on the V site and anionic redox on the (S2)2&#8722; site; enabled by reversible cleavage of S&#8722;S bonds, identified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Detailed structural characterisation with maximum entropy method analysis, supported by density functional theory and projected density of states analysis, reveals that the sulphur species involved in anion redox are not connected to the transition metal centres, spatially separating the two redox processes. This facilitates fast and reversible Mg insertion in which the nature of the redox process depends on the cation insertion site, creating a synergy between the occupancy of specific Mg sites and the location of the electrons transferred.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Asymmetric Backbone for Highly Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.7&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules, namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTM in organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the system of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;eC9. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.7&#8201;%, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of storage at air ambient.







Abstract
The hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS), is the most widely used material in the realization of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the stability of PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS&#8208;based OSCs is quite poor, arising from its strong acidity and hygroscopicity. In addition, PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS has an absorption in the infrared region and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, thus limiting the enhancement of short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. Herein, two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs), namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTM in binary OSCs based on the well&#8208;known system of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;eC9. Compared with BrCz, BrBACz shows larger dipole moment, deeper work function and lower surface energy. Moreover, BrBACz not only enhances photon harvesting in the active layer, but also minimizes voltage losses as well as improves interface charge extraction/ transport. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz as HTM exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.70&#8201;% with a remarkable Jsc of 29.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Voc of 0.856&#8197;V, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs so far. In addition, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of storage at air ambient, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability.

Herein, two asymmetric self-assembled molecules (SAMs), namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTM in binary OSCs based on the well-known system of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;eC9. Compared with BrCz, BrBACz shows larger dipole moment, deeper work function and lower surface energy. Moreover, BrBACz not only enhances photon harvesting in the active layer, but also minimizes voltage losses as well as improves interface charge extraction/ transport. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9-based binary OSC using BrBACz as HTM exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.70&#8201;% with a remarkable &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt; of 29.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.856&#8197;V, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs so far. In addition, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of storage at air ambient, indicating excellent long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triazine Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine frameworks were employed as metal&#8208;free visible light photocatalysts for the efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons under ambient conditions. The catalytic efficiency of the meticulously crafted thiophene&#8208;based CTF was remarkably similar to that of transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysts previously reported. This not only highlights the potential of CTFs but also enhances our comprehension of the mechanisms governing effective C&#8722;H activation within photocatalytic polymers.







Abstract
Investigations into the selective oxidation of inert sp3 C&#8722;H bonds using polymer photocatalysts under mild conditions have been limited. Additionally, the structure&#8208;activity relationship of photocatalysts often remains insufficiently explored. Here, a series of thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are used for the efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to aldehydes or ketones under ambient aerobic conditions. Spectroscopic methods conducted in situ and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the sulfur atoms within the thiophene units play a pivotal role as oxidation sites due to the generation of photogenerated holes. The effect of photogenerated holes on photocatalytic toluene oxidation was investigated by varying the length of the spacer in a CTF donor&#8208;acceptor based photocatalyst. Furthermore, the manipulation of reactive oxygen species was employed to enhance selectivity by weakening the peroxidative capacity. As an illustrative example, this study successfully demonstrated the synthesis of a precursor of the neurological drug AMG&#8208;579 using a photocatalytic protocol.

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Interphases Regulated by Trace Dual Electrolyte Additives for Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid aqueous electrolyte of ZnSO4 with trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate enables ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anode by virtue of D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species alternately and reversibly adsorb on Zn surface to form dynamical molecular interphases and enter Zn2+ solvation sheath to boost de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits exceptional stability for &gt;6400&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Metallic zinc is a promising anode material for rechargeable aqueous multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries due to its high capacity and low cost. However, the practical use is always beset by severe dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions occurring at anode/electrolyte interface. Here we demonstrate dynamic molecular interphases caused by trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate for ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. Triggered by plating and stripping electric fields, the D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species are alternately and reversibly (de&#8208;)adsorbed on Zn metal, respectively, to accelerate Zn2+ transportation for uniform Zn nucleation and deposition and inhibit side reactions for high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating behaviors for &gt;6400&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which enables long&#8208;term cycling stability of Zn||ZnxMnO2 full cell for more than 2000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecule Aggregation for Nearly Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Sol Electrolyte to Advanced Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries: The Case of Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal as a promising anode of aqueous batteries faces the severe challenges from dendrite growth and side reactions. Here, tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS) is explored as an electrolyte additive for advanced Zn anodes. It is interesting to note that TPPS spontaneously assembles into unique aggregates. As they adsorb on the Zn anode, the aggregates enhance the resistance to electrolyte percolation and dendrite growth compared to the reported single molecules. Meanwhile, TPPS facilitates anion association in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, and boosts the transference number of Zn2+ up to 0.95. Therefore, anion&#8208;related side reactions and anion&#8208;induced electrode overpotentials are reduced accordingly. In this context, the electrolyte containing TPPS exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance. Even under a high loading of MnO2 (25 mg cm&#8208;2), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.7), and a lean electrolyte (15 uL mAh&#8208;1), the full cells still represent a higher cumulative capacity compared to the reported data. The advantages of this electrolyte are also adapted to other cathode materials. The pouch cells of Zn|| NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O realize a capacity of ~0.35 Ah at 0.4 C under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Promoted Activation of N2O, Amine, and H2 as well as Catalytic Hydrogenation of Imines, Quinoline, and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond activation and catalysis using s&#8208;block metals are of great significance but underexplored. Herein, a series of calcium pincer complexes with deprotonated side arms have been prepared using pyridine&#8208;based PNP and PNN ligands. The complexes were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystal diffraction. Utilizing the obtained calcium complexes, unprecedented N2O activation by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) involving dearomatization&#8208;aromatization of the pyridine ligand was achieved, generating aromatized calcium diazotate complexes as products. Additionally, the dearomatized calcium complexes were able to activate the N&#8211;H bond as well as reversibly activate H2, offering an opportunity for the catalytic hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules. DFT calculations were applied to analyze the electronic structures of the synthesized complexes and explore possible reaction mechanisms. This study is an important complement to the area of MLC and main&#8208;group metal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Minimalistic Covalent Bond&#8208;Forming Chemical Reaction Cycle that Consumes Adenosine Diphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of active matter requires the ability to design materials capable of harnessing energy from a source to carry out work. Nature achieves this using chemical reaction cycles in which energy released from an exergonic chemical reaction is used to drive biochemical processes. Although many chemically fuelled synthetic reaction cycles&#160;have been reported, the generally high complexity of the reported systems hampers a full understanding of how the available chemical energy is actually exploited by these systems. This lack of understanding is a limiting factor in the design of active matter. Here, we report a minimalistic reaction cycle in which adenosine diphosphate (ADP) triggers the formation of a catalyst for its own hydrolysis. This establishes an interdependence between the concentrations of the network components resulting in the transient formation of the catalyst. The network is sufficiently simple that all kinetic and thermodynamic parameters governing its behaviour can be characterised, allowing kinetic models to be built that simulate the progress of reactions within the network. While the current network does not enable the ADP&#8208;hydrolysis reaction to populate a nonequilibrium composition, these models provide insight into the way the network dissipates energy. Furthermore, design principles are revealed for constructing driven systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilization of Amino&#8208;site into a Pore&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Separation of Propyne/Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation of propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) is a crucial yet complex process, however, it remains a great difficulty in developing porous materials that can meet the requirements for practical applications, particularly with an exceptional ability to bind and store trace amounts of C3H4. Functionalization of pore&#8208;partitioned metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ppMOFs) is methodically suited for this challenge owing to the possibility of dramatically increasing binding sites on highly porous and confined domains. We here immobilized Lewis&#8208;basic (&#8208;NH2) and Lewis&#8208;acidic (&#8208;NO2) sites on this platform. Along with an integrated nature of high uptake of C3H4 at 1 kPa, high uptake difference of C3H4&#8208;C3H6, moderated binding strength, promoted kinetic selectivity, trapping effect and high stability, the NH2&#8208;decorated ppMOF (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2) can efficiently produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 (99.95%, 8.3 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1) at room temperature, which is six times more than the NO2&#8208;decorated crystal (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NO2). The in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, crystallographic analysis, and sequential blowing tests showed that the densely packed amino group in this highly porous system has a unique ability to recognize and stabilize C3H4 molecules. Moving forward, the strategy of organic functionalization can be extended to other porous systems, making it a powerful tool to customize advanced materials for challenging tasks.</dc:description>

Functionalization of pore-partitioned metal-organic frameworks (ppMOFs) is methodically suited for this challenge owing to the possibility of dramatically increasing binding sites on highly porous and confined domains. We here immobilized Lewis-basic (-NH2) and Lewis-acidic (-NO2) sites on this platform. Along with an integrated nature of high uptake of C3H4 at 1 kPa, high uptake difference of C3H4-C3H6, moderated binding strength, promoted kinetic selectivity, trapping effect and high stability, the NH2-decorated ppMOF (NTU-100-NH2) can efficiently produce polymer-grade C3H6 (99.95%, 8.3 mmol&#183;g-1) at room temperature, which is six times more than the NO2-decorated crystal (NTU-100-NO2). The in-situ infrared spectroscopy, crystallographic analysis, and sequential blowing tests showed that the densely packed amino group in this highly porous system has a unique ability to recognize and stabilize C3H4 molecules. Moving forward, the strategy of organic functionalization can be extended to other porous systems, making it a powerful tool to customize advanced materials for challenging tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stoichiometric Haloform Coupling for Ester Synthesis with Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The haloform reaction from methyl ketones to carboxylic acids is one of the oldest known synthetic organic reactions and has been used in myriad applications over the decades. The corresponding reaction to produce esters is, however, less developed, as the reaction is generally limited to simple, primary alcohols that are used in solvent&#8208;level quantities, thereby restricting the complexity of esters that can be directly formed. Herein, we detail the development of a general ester&#8209;forming haloform coupling reaction using one equivalent of alcohol. Mechanistic and kinetic modelling studies demonstrated that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which facilitated the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells Enabled by 1, 2, 4&#8208;Selenadiazole&#8208;Containing Crystalline Small Molecule with Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer morphology is recognized as an ideal structure facilitating exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed OSCs (LbL&#8208;OSCs), polymer donors and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are separately deposited, and it is challenging to realize a fibril network of pure SMAs with the absence of tight interchain entanglement as polymers. In this work, crystalline small molecule donors (SMDs), named TDZ&#8208;3TR and SeDZ&#8208;3TR, were designed and introduced into the L8&#8208;BO acceptor solution, forcing the phase separation and molecular fibrilization. SeDZ&#8208;3TR showed higher crystallinity and lower miscibility with L8&#8208;BO acceptor than TDZ&#8208;3TR, enabling more driving force to favor the phase separation and better molecular fibrilization of L8&#8208;BO. On the other hand, two donor polymers of PM6 and D18 with different fibril widths and lengths were put together to optimize the fibril network of the donor layer. The simultaneously optimization of the acceptor and donor layers resulted in a more ideal double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer and an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38% in LbL&#8208;OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bending, Twisting, and Propulsion of Photoreactive Crystals by Controlled Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid release of gas by a chemical reaction to generate momentum is one of the most fundamental ways to elicit motion that could be used to sustain and control the motility of objects. We report that hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in liquid media. In needle&#8208;like regular crystals, the reaction occurs mainly on the surface and results in the formation of cracks that evolve due to internal pressure; the expansion on the cracked surface of the crystal results in bending, twisting, or coiling of the crystal. In hollow crystals, gas accumulates inside their cavity and emanates preferentially from the recess at the crystal terminus, propelling the crystal to undergo directional photomechanical motion through the liquid. The motility of the object which can be controlled externally to perform work delineates the concept of &#8220;crystal microbots&#8221;, realized by photoreactive organic crystals where prolonged directional motion for actuation or delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Photochromic Silver(I) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Alternative Topology, Dynamic Photoluminescence and Efficient Photothermal Conversion Modulated by Anionic Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photogenerated radicals are an indispensable member of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photochromic material family, as they can effectively modulate the photoluminescence and photothermal conversion performance of radical&#8208;induced photochromic complexes. Herein, two novel radical&#8208;induced photochromic metal&#8210;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Ag(TEPE)](AC)&#8901;7/4H2O&#8901;5/4EtOH (1) and [Ag(TEPE)](NC)&#8901;3H2O&#8901;EtOH (2), are reported. Distinctly different topological networks can be obtained by judiciously introducing alternative &#960;&#8211;conjugated anionic guests, including a new topological structure (named as sfm) first reported in this work, describing as 4,4,4,4&#8208;c net. EPR data and UV&#8208;Vis spectra prove the radical&#8208;induced photochromic mechanism. Dynamic photochromism exhibits tunability in a wide CIE color space, with a linear segment from yellow to red for 1, while a curved coordinate line for 2, resulting in colorful emission from blue to orange. Moreover, photogenerated TEPE* radicals effectively activate the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion effect of MOFs. Under 1 W cm&#8208;2 808 nm laser irradiation, the surface temperatures of photoproducts 1* and 2* can reach ~160 &#8451; and ~120 &#8451;, respectively, with competitive NIR photothermal conversion efficiencies &#951; = 51.8% (1*) and 36.2% (2*). This work develops a feasible electrostatic compensation strategy to accurately introduce photoactive anionic guests into MOFs to construct multifunctional radical&#8208;induced photothermal conversion materials with tunable photoluminescence behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Superoxide Radicals in Uranyl Peroxide Solids: Lasting Signatures Identified by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>U(VI) peroxide phases (studtite and meta&#8208;studtite) are found throughout the nuclear fuel cycle and exist as corrosion products in high radiation fields.&#160; Peroxides are part of a family of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that include hydroperoxyl and superoxide species and are produced during alpha radiolysis of water.&#160; While U(VI) peroxides have been thoroughly investigated, the incorporation and stability of ROS species within studtite have not been validated. In the current study, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to identify the presence of free radicals within a series of U(VI) peroxide samples containing depleted, weapons&#8208;grade, and natural uranium.&#160; Density functional theory calculations indicated that the predicted EPR signals matched well with a superoxide (O2&#8208;&#8226;) species incorporated into the studtite structure, confirming the presence of ROS in the material. Further analysis of samples that were synthesized between 1945 and 2023 indicated that there is a correlation between the radical signal and the product of specific activity multiplied by age of the sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimerized Acceptors with Conjugate&#8208;Break Linker Enable Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing new acceptors is critical for intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) with high efficiency and mechanical robustness. However, nearly all stretchable polymer acceptors exhibit limited efficiency and high&#8208;performance small molecular acceptors are very brittle. In this regard, we select thienylene&#8208;alkane&#8208;thienylene (TAT) as the conjugate&#8208;break linker and synthesize four dimerized acceptors by the regulation of connecting sites and halogen substitutions. It is found that the connecting sites and halogen substitutions considerably impact the overall electronic structures, aggregation behaviors, and charge transport properties. Benefiting from the optimization of the molecular structure, the dimerized acceptor exhibits rational phase separation within the blend films, which significantly facilitates exciton dissociation while effectively suppressing charge recombination processes. Consequently, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid OSCs render the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.07% among reported acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linker. Most importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based IS&#8208;OSCs achieve high PCE (14.29%) and remarkable stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 18.23%), significantly surpassing Y6&#8208;based counterpart (PCE = 12.80% and COS = 8.50%). To sum up, these findings demonstrate that dimerized acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linkers have immense potential in developing highly efficient and mechanically robust OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude Enhancement of Photoinitiation Activity via A Simple Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of high&#8208;performance photoinitiator is the key to enhance the printing speed, structure resolution and product quality in 3D laser printing. Here, to improve the printing efficiency of 3D laser nanoprinting, we investigate the underlying photochemistry of gold and silver nanocluster initiators under multiphoton laser excitation. Experimental results and DFT calculations reveal the high cleavage probability of the surface S&#8208;C bonds in gold and silver nanoclusters which generate multiple radicals. Based on this understanding, we design several alkyl&#8208;thiolated gold nanoclusters and achieve a more than two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of photoinitiation activity, as well as a significant improvement in printing resolution and fabrication window. Overall, this work for the first time unveils the detailed radical formation pathways of gold and silver nanoclusters under multiphoton activation and substantially improves their photoinitiation sensitivity via surface engineering, which pushes the limit of the printing efficiency of 3D laser lithography.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Supporting Atomic Bi&#8722;N2O2&#160;Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic CO2&#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atomic catalysts (SACs) offer a superior platform for studying the structure&#8208;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to obtain well&#8208;defined and novel site configuration owing to the uncertainty of functional framework&#8208;derived SACs through calcination.&#160;Herein, a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2&#160;site supported on the (1 1 0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) is reported directly for CO2RR.&#160;In flow cell, the target catalyst Bi1&#8208;HOF maintains a faradaic efficiency (FE) HCOOH of over 90% at a wide potential window of 1.4 V.&#160; The corresponding partial current density ranges from 113.3 to 747.0 mA cm&#8722;2. And, Bi1&#8208;HOF exhibits a long&#8208;term stability of over 30 h under a successive potential&#8208;step test with a current density of 100~400 mA cm&#8722;2. Density function theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1 1 0) plane of HOF effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from Bi center to CO2 molecule, reaching an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. Besides, this study offers a versatile method to reach series of M&#8722;N2O2 sites with regulable metal centers via the same intercalation mechanism, broadening the platform for studying the&#160;structure&#8208;activity relationships during CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chiral B&#8722;N Adduct as a New Frontier in Ferroelectrics and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral B&#8722;N adduct [RC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (RMBA&#8208;BF3) was synthesized and found to display excellent ferroelectric polarization, as established by experimental and theoretical characterizations. Mechanical energy harvesting devices made from its as&#8208;made crystals were shown to exhibit efficient piezoelectric nanogenerator output performance.







Abstract
Within the burgeoning field of electronic materials, B&#8722;N Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, distinguished by their partial charge distribution across boron and nitrogen centers, represent an underexplored class with significant potential. These materials exhibit inherent dipoles and are excellent candidates for ferroelectricity. However, the challenge lies in achieving the optimal combination of hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base pairs to yield B&#8722;N adducts with stable dipoles. Herein, we present an enantiomeric pair of B&#8722;N adducts [R/SC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (R/SMBA&#8208;BF3) crystallizing in the polar monoclinic P21 space group. The ferroelectric measurements on RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave a rectangular P&#8208;E hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization of 7.65&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a value that aligns with the polarization derived from the extensive density&#8208;functional theory computations. The PFM studies on the drop&#8208;casted film of RMBA&#8208;BF3 further corroborate the existence of ferroelectric domains, displaying characteristic amplitude&#8208;bias butterfly and phase&#8208;bias hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA&#8208;BF3 was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5&#8197;pC&#8201;N&#8722;1 for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as&#8208;made crystals of RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2&#8197;V. This work thus underscores the untapped potential of B&#8722;N adducts in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.

         <title>The Versatile Establishment of Charge Storage in Polymer Solid Electrolyte with Enhanced Charge Transfer for LiF&#8208;Rich SEI Generation in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin covalent organic framework (POF) with &#8220;charge storage&#8221; properties is designed and integrated into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to investigate the impact of adequate charge transfer on lithium salt decomposition. The results show that LiTFSI can obtain sufficient charge from POF to promote the formation of LiF&#8208;rich SEl layer, thus improving the cycling performance of the battery.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;state electrolyte interface (SEI) between the solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte and the lithium metal anode dramatically affects the overall battery performance. Increasing the content of lithium fluoride (LiF) in SEI can help the uniform deposition of lithium and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites, thus improving the cycle stability performance of lithium batteries. Currently, most methods of constructing LiF SEI involve decomposing the lithium salt by the polar groups of the filler. However, there is a lack of research reports on how to affect the SEI layer of Li&#8208;ion batteries by increasing the charge transfer number. In this study, a porous organic polymer with &#8220;charge storage&#8221; properties was prepared and doped into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to study the effect of sufficient charge transfer on the decomposition of lithium salts. The results show in contrast to porphyrins, the unique structure of POF allows for charge transfer between each individual porphyrin. Therefore, during TFSI&#8722; decomposition to the formation of LiF, TFSI&#8722; can obtain sufficient charge, thereby promoting the break of C&#8722;F and forming the LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Compared with single porphyrin (0.423&#8197;e&#8722;), POF provides 2.7&#8197;times more charge transfer to LiTFSI (1.147&#8197;e&#8722;). The experimental results show that Li//Li symmetric batteries equipped with PEO&#8208;POF can be operated stably for more than 2700&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Even the Li//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) symmetric cells are stable for more than 1100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In addition, LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li batteries have excellent cycling performance at 2&#8197;C (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 750 cycles). Even LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) cells have excellent cycling performance at 1&#8197;C (96&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Even when the PEO&#8208;base is replaced with a PEG&#8208;base and a PVDF&#8208;base, the performance of the cell is still significantly improved. Therefore, we believe that the concept of charge transfer offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance assemblies.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Compatible Gel&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by NaF&#8208;Solubility&#8208;Regulation toward All&#8208;Climate Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
In the designed &#8220;salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer&#8221; gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte, dissolved NaF salt occupies free solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment and added aggregates, which induced stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. It delivers enhanced Na+ transport kinetics from electrolyte to interface and high compatibility with different cathodes and anodes. The assembled solid&#8208;state Na&#8201;||&#8201;Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a pragmatic choice for high&#8208;safety sodium batteries but still plagued by interfacial compatibility with both cathode and anode simultaneously. Here, salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer fibers with NaF salt inlaid in polylactide (PLA) fiber network was fabricated via electrospinning and subsequent in situ forming gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte in liquid electrolytes. The obtained PLA&#8208;NaF GPE achieves a high ion conductivity (2.50&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and large Na+ transference number (0.75) at ambient temperature. Notably, the dissolution of NaF salt occupies solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment, which facilitates aggregates with increased anionic coordination (anion/Na+ &gt;1). Aggregates with higher HOMO realize the preferential oxidation on the cathode so that inorganic&#8208;rich and stable CEI covers cathode&#8217; surface, preventing particles&#8217; breakage and showing good compatibility with different cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)3, Na2+2xFe2&#8208;x(SO4)3, Na0.72Ni0.32Mn0.68O2, NaTi2(PO4)3). While, passivated Na anode induced by the lower LUMO of aggregates, and the lower surface tension between Na anode and PLA&#8208;NaF GPE interface, leading to the dendrites&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the assembled Na&#8201;||&#8201;Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Pyrene&#8208;Based Hole Transporting Material Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Py&#8208;DB with an extended conjugated structure is an effective dopant&#8208;free HTM when applied in n&#8208;i&#8208;p&#8208;type PSCs, affording an efficiency of 24.33&#8201;%, the highest PCE for a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM.







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is significant to the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we developed a novel star&#8208;shape arylamine HTM, termed Py&#8208;DB, with a pyrene core and carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds as the bridge units. Compared to the reference HTM (termed Py&#8208;C), the extension of the planar conjugation backbone endows Py&#8208;DB with typical intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions and excellent solubility, resulting in improved hole mobility and film morphology. In addition, the lower HOMO energy level of the Py&#8208;DB HTM provides efficient hole extraction with reduced energy loss at the perovskite/HTM interface. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.33&#8201;% was achieved for dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based PSCs, which is the highest PCE for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p configured PSCs. The dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based device also exhibits improved long&#8208;term stability, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h exposure to 25&#8201;% humidity at 60&#8201;&#176;C. These findings provide valuable insights and approaches for the further development of dopant&#8208;free HTMs for efficient and reliable PSCs.

A &#8220;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8221; type coronene diimide&#8208;core double nanohoop (CDI&#8211;CPP), which has significant intra&#8211; and intermolecular charge&#8211;transfer interactions in the solid state, was designed and synthesized. CDI&#8211;CPP can undergo rapid intersystem crossing in neat film with a time constant of 238&#8197;ps.







Abstract
The development of innovative triplet materials plays a significant role in various applications. Although effective tuning of triplet formation by intersystem crossing (ISC) has been well established in solution, the modulation of ISC processes in the solid state remains a challenge due to the presence of other exciton decay channels through intermolecular interactions. The cyclic structure of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) offers a unique platform to tune the intermolecular packing, which leads to controllable exciton dynamics in the solid state. Herein, by integrating an electron deficient coronene diimide (CDI) unit into the CPP framework, a donor&#8208;acceptor type of conjugated macrocycle (CDI&#8208;CPP) featuring intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interaction was designed and synthesized. Effective intermolecular CT interaction resulting from a slipped herringbone packing was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Transient spectroscopy studies showed that CDI&#8208;CPP undergoes ISC in both solution and the film state, with triplet generation time constants of 4.5&#8197;ns and 238&#8197;ps, respectively. The rapid triplet formation through ISC in the film state can be ascribed to the cooperation between intra&#8208; and intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interactions. Our results highlight that intermolecular CT interaction has a pronounced effect on the ISC process in the solid state, and shed light on the use of the characteristic structure of CPPs to manipulate intermolecular CT interactions.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Allysine for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic approach was developed for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of the side chain of dimethyl lysine. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope and modifies dimethyl lysine and tertiary amines to form aldehydes in small molecules, peptides, proteins and cells.







Abstract
Inspired by the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which selectively converts the side chain of lysine into allysine, an aldehyde&#8208;containing post&#8208;translational modification, we report herein the first chemical method for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of dimethyl lysine. This approach is highly chemoselective for dimethyl lysine on proteins. We highlight the utility of this biomimetic approach for generating aldehydes in a variety of pharmaceutically active linear and cyclic peptides at a late stage for their diversification with various affinity and fluorescent tags. Notably, we utilized this approach for generating small&#8208;molecule aldehydes from the corresponding tertiary amines. We further demonstrated the potential of this approach in generating cellular models for studying allysine&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Regulating Lateral Adsorbate Interaction for Efficient Electroreforming of Bio&#8208;polyols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation was proposed. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which effectively tuned the adsorption energies and tailored the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products.







Abstract
Tailoring the selectivity at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface is one of the greatest challenges for heterogeneous electrocatalysis, and complementary strategies to catalyst structural designs need to be developed. Herein, we proposed a new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways by lateral adsorbate interaction for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion possesses the alcoholic property that facilely adsorbs on the nickel oxyhydroxide catalyst, but is resistant to oxidation due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl groups. The alien HFIP adsorbents can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which achieved a &gt;2&#8208;fold enhancement of the oxalate selectivity to 55&#8201;% for the representative glycerol oxidation and can be extended to various bio&#8208;polyol substrates. Through in situ spectroscopic analysis and DFT calculation on the glycerol oxidation, we reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded adsorbate interaction can effectively tune the adsorption energies and tailor the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products. This work offers an additional perspective of tuning electrocatalytic reactions via introducing redox&#8208;innocent adsorbates to create lateral adsorbate interactions.

         <title>A Tag&#8208;Free Platform for Synthesis and Screening of Cyclic Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS), macrocyclic peptide libraries traditionally necessitate decoding tags, essential for both library synthesis and identifying hit peptide sequences post&#8208;screening. Our innovation introduces a tag&#8208;free technology platform for synthesizing cyclic peptide libraries in solution and facilitates screening against biological targets to identify peptide binders through unconventional intramolecular CyClick and DeClick Chemistries (CCDC) discovered within our research. This combination allows for the synthesis of diverse cyclic peptide libraries, the incorporation of various amino acids, and facile linearization and decoding of cyclic peptide binder sequences. Our sensitivity&#8208;enhancing derivatization method, utilized in tandem with nano LC&#8208;MS/MS, enables the sequencing of peptides even at exceedingly low picomolar concentrations. Employing our technology platform, we've successfully unearthed novel cyclic peptide binders against a monoclonal antibody and the first cyclic peptide binder of HIV CAPSID protein responsible for viral infections as validated by microscale thermalshift assays (TSA), biolayer Interferometry (BLI) and functional assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Porous Aromatic Framework&#160;Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) show promising potential in anionic conduction due to their high stability and customizable functionality. However, the insolubility of most PAFs presents a significant challenge in their processing into membranes and subsequent applications. In this study, continuous PAF membranes with adjustable thickness were successfully created using liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization. The rigid backbone and the stable C&#8722;C coupling endow PAF membrane with superior chemical and dimensional stabilities over most conventional polymer membranes. Different quaternary ammonium functionalities were anchored to the backbone through flexible alkyl chains with tunable length. The optimal PAF membrane exhibited an OH&#8208;&#160;conductivity of 356.6 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity. Additionally, the PAF membrane exhibited outstanding alkaline stability, retaining 95% of its OH&#8722; conductivity after 1000 hours in 1M NaOH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of PAF materials in anion exchange membranes, achieving the highest OH&#8722; conductivity and exceptional chemical/dimensional stability. This work provides the possibility for the potential of PAF materials in anionic conductive membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Revision of a Widespread Marine Sulfonolipid Class Based on Isolation and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cosmopolitan marine Roseobacter clade is of global biogeochemical importance. Members of this clade produce sulfur&#8208;containing amino lipids (SALs) of importance for biofilm formation and marine surface colonization processes. Despite their physiological importance and abundance, SALs have only been explored through genomic mining approaches and lipidomic studies based on mass spectrometry, which left the relative and absolute structures of SALs unresolved hindering progress in biochemical and functional investigations. Here, we report the structural revision of a new group of SALs, which we named cysteinolides, using a combination of analytical techniques, isolation and degradation experiments and total synthetic efforts. Contrary to the previously proposed homotaurine&#8208;based structures, cysteinolides are composed of an N,O&#8208;acylated cysteinolic acid&#8208;containing head group carrying various different (&#945;&#8209;hydroxy) carboxylic acids. We performed the first validated targeted&#8208;network based analysis, which allowed us to map the distribution and structural diversity of cysteinolides across bacterial lineages. Beyond offering structural insights, our research provides SAL standards and validated analytical data. This information holds significance for forthcoming investigations into bacterial sulfonolipid metabolism and biogeochemical nutrient cycling within marine environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Dissipative Control of Multimodal Motion in a Silver(I) Catenate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stepwise dissipative control of two distinct motions, i.e., shuttling and sliding, is demonstrated in a single multicomponent device. When [2]rotaxane 1, which acts as a biped, and deck 2 were treated with AgBF4 / PhCH2Br + NEt3 as chemical fuel, the transient catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8226;[Ag3(2)]3+ was instantly generated showing multimodal motion and autonomous return to 1 and 2. In the dissipative process, catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8226;[Ag3(2)]3+ cleanly transformed into the follow&#8208;up transient device (1)&#8226;[Ag3(2)]3+ exhibiting only sliding motion. Two interference&#8208;free dissipative cycles proved the resilience and robustness of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Modified RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribonucleic acids&#160;play a vital role in living organisms. Many of their cellular functions depend critically on chemical modification. Methods to modify RNA in a controlled manner &#8211; both in vitro and in vivo &#8211; are thus essential to evaluate and understand RNA biology at the molecular and mechanistic levels. The diversity of modifications, combined with the size and uniformity of RNA (made up of only 4 nucleotides) makes its site&#8208;specific modification a challenging task that needs to be addressed by complementary approaches. One such approach is solid&#8208;phase RNA synthesis. We discuss recent developments in this field, starting with new protection concepts in the ongoing effort to overcome current size limitations. We continue with selected modifications that have posed significant challenges for their incorporation into RNA. These include deazapurine bases required for atomic mutagenesis to elucidate mechanistic aspects of catalytic RNAs, and RNA containing xanthosine, N4&#8208;acetylcytidine, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytidine, 3&#8208;methylcytidine, 2&#8217;&#8208;OCF3, and 2&#8217;&#8208;N3 ribose modifications. We also discuss the all&#8208;chemical synthesis of 5&#8217;&#8208;capped mRNAs and the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides to obtain long RNA with multiple distinct modifications, such as those needed for single&#8208;molecule FRET&#8208;studies. Finally, we highlight promising developments in RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modification using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Decorated Hexacyanodiborane(6) Dianion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First examples of diborane(6) dianions decorated with weakly coordination B(C6F5)3 (BCF) groups and SiEt3+ moieties have been synthesized demonstrating the synthetic potential of the [B2(CN)6]2&#8722; dianion. [B2{CNB(C6F5)3}6]2&#8211; (1) was isolated as potassium and tetrabutylammonium salt. 1 is a rare example for a weakly coordinating dianion and it was used for the stabilization of the carbo&#173;cation [Ph3C]+ and the oxonium acid [H(OEt2)2]+. Reaction of [Ph3C]21 with HSiEt3 resulted in the silylated neutral diborane(6) [B2{CNB(C6F5)3}4(CNSiEt3)2] (2) in which two BCF groups have been selectively replaced by SiEt3+ substituents, underlining the stability and chemical versatility of the [B2(CN)6]2&#8722; dianion. The chemical properties and physicochemical data of 1 and 2 provide insight into electronic, coordinating, and steric properties of theses novel diborane(6) compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the direct synthesis of new azulene derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reactions. A five&#8208;membered ring as backbone in the applied triene&#8208;yne substrates turned out to be crucial to induce the 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization mode necessary to trigger azulene formation. The obtained targets are of high interest due to their potential applications in different fields, like organic materials, medicine or cosmetics. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry were measured, based on these the electronic properties were determined . Short two or three step sequences towards the applied starting materials make this approach synthetically highly attractive.</dc:description>
