         <title>Translational Supramolecular Thioorthoester Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The translation of new dynamic covalent thioorthoester chemistry into crosslinked metal scavengers and porous sulfur&#8208;rich lithium battery cathodes is highlighted as an example how the integration of new principles in supramolecular chemistry can open new directions to approach questions of significance in science and society.








Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry promises that insights into contact between molecules will open up new directions to approach significant questions in science and society. In this spirit, Kraus et&#160;al. report the translation of fundamentally new dynamic covalent thioorthoester chemistry into metal&#8208;scavenging porous network materials and sulfur&#8208;rich, leakage&#8208;free cathode composites in lithium batteries (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70000).

In their Research Article (e202508528), Noriyuki Uchida, Takahiro Muraoka, and co&#8208;workers develop a nanofiber&#8208;forming peptide (A2Az) enabling photo&#8208;control of adhesion and dispersion of M13 bacteriophage virus and successfully demonstrated patterning of localization and infection of the virus. The cover image illustrates adhesion of the virus onto the A2Az supramolecular nanofibers and its dispersion to trigger infection with Escherichia coli.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Modeling Midbrain and Brainstem Neuromelanins to Characterize Metal Binding and Associated MRI Contrast in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuromelanin is a pigment in the brain and an effective metal chelator. It is likely a crucial factor in the viability of neurons, which has sparked interest in MRI biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In their Research Article (e202509102), Harald E. M&#246;ller and co&#8208;workers demonstrate remarkable complexity of the binding of Fe and Cu to synthetic neuromelanin analogues, with different binding sites, competition, and intricate magnetic properties, all of which affect the proton relaxation of surrounding water, the main contrast mechanism in MRI.

The image illustrates frustrated spins in the triangular Fe3(&#956;3&#8208;O) nodes of the MIL&#8208;101(Fe). In their Research Article (e202514014), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez, Georg Kresse and co&#8208;workers reveal the true antiferromagnetic ground state of such metal&#8208;organic frameworks by using spin&#8208;flip, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT. This intrinsic spin frustration determines structure stability and controls the temperature&#8208;dependent switch between N2 fixation and CO adsorption. The &#8220;spin&#8208;city&#8221; illustration is designed by Caroline Lechner.

The cover image depicts a [6]catenane topology woven from six interlocked rings with 18 crossings, formed via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands yields exclusively topological enantiomers. The mirrored, semi&#8208;transparent structure below represents the opposite&#8208;handed topology against a celestial backdrop, highlighting the elegance and grandeur of the assembly. Details are reported by Guo&#8208;Xin Jin, Zheng Cui, et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202515400).

Incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid rings into cycloarylenes profoundly affects their molecular geometry and photophysics. In their Research Article (e202512344), Zheng Zhou and co&#8208;workers report a reductive cleavage strategy that dissociates {FeCp} moieties to yield two anionic cycloarylenes, which exhibit abnormal anti&#8208;Kasha emission and ultra&#8208;long thermally activated delayed fluorescence.

         <title>Considerations in Pursuing Reaction Scope Generality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods that are applicable to a broad range of substrates are sought after, owing to their utility in industrial settings. This minireview describes considerations associated with how chemists define and identify general methods, especially with the emergence of modern analytical, high&#8208;throughput, and data science tools in chemistry, and gives the reader an overview of workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.








Abstract
The term &#8220;generality&#8221; has recently been popularized in synthetic chemistry, owing largely to the increasing use of high&#8208;throughput technology for producing vast quantities of data and the emergence of data science tools to plan and interpret these experiments. Despite this, the term has not been clearly defined, and there is no standardized approach toward developing a method with a diverse (general) scope. This minireview will examine different emerging strategies toward achieving generality using selected examples and aims to give the reader an overview of modern workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.

         <title>Topology&#8208;Engineered Guide RNAs for Programmable Control of CRISPR/Cas Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;engineered guide RNAs (TE&#8208;gRNAs) provide precise spatiotemporal control over CRISPR/Cas9, Cas12a, and Cas13 systems. By introducing photolabile and chemical&#8208;responsive modifications into RNA topology, such as polymeric, cyclic or star&#8208;shaped architectures, this Minireview presents strategies to reversibly modulate gene editing activities, enabling programmable and conditional genome engineering.








Abstract
CRISPR/Cas systems have transformed genome editing, yet achieving precise temporal and conditional control remains challenging. Traditional strategies involving linear guide RNAs (gRNAs) modified with multiple chemical groups throughout their strands often face limitations such as heterogeneous reaction outcomes, irreversibility, and variable editing efficiencies. To overcome these issues, topology&#8208;engineered guide RNAs (TE&#8208;gRNAs) have emerged, featuring defined structural architectures including polymeric, circular, and dendrimer&#8208;like topologies that enable precise spatial control, reversibility, and programmable activation of CRISPR activity. By selectively incorporating physical or chemically responsive linkers and stimuli&#8208;sensitive groups at specific sites, TE&#8208;gRNAs facilitate dynamic and conditional genome editing that can be activated or deactivated with external triggers such as light or chemical signals. These engineered RNA structures significantly improve synthesis feasibility, stability, reduce off&#8208;target effects, and provide unprecedented control over gene editing processes. Recent advancements in TE&#8208;gRNAs demonstrate their broad applicability in synthetic biology, functional genomics, and therapeutic interventions, highlighting their potential to achieve precise spatiotemporal modulation of CRISPR systems. This review summarizes the current strategies, benefits, and challenges associated with TE&#8208;gRNAs, and discusses future directions for enhancing their performance and utility in complex genome editing applications.

         <title>Modeling Midbrain and Brainstem Neuromelanins to Characterize Metal Binding and Associated MRI Contrast in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic neuromelanin analogs are used to characterize iron and copper binding to the melanin moiety or to conjugated protein (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin). The models confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear&#8208;binding sites and iron or mixed&#8208;metal clusters that enhance water proton relaxation to varying degrees. The results help to better understand MRI contrast changes related to altered neuromelanin content in the brain due to neurodegeneration.








Abstract
Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment that binds potentially toxic metal ions and is crucial for neuronal vulnerability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to measure neuromelanin in the substantia nigra or locus coeruleus, potentially providing a marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, synthetic neuromelanin analogues were prepared with iron and copper and used for characterization of metal binding and impact on proton relaxation, a prerequisite for optimizing neuromelanin&#8208;sensitive MRI. The results confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear Fe(III) and antiferromagnetically coupled clusters, which enhance relaxation to variable degrees. Further complexity arises from Cu(II), which can compete for binding to mononuclear sites, aggregate in mixed&#8208;metal clusters, or bind to proteins associated with the melanin moiety. Unlike the strong relaxant Fe(III), Cu(II) only indirectly impacts relaxation by replacing iron. Overall, MRI primarily provides measures of average neuromelanin concentrations. Information on the distribution of neuromelanins with different metal compositions might be obtained with multiparametric MRI.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroelectrochemical Observation of Overlayer&#8208;Induced Charge Carrier Dynamics in Water Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 overlayers on WO3 photoanode enhance photoelectrochemical water oxidation by surface and interfacial engineering. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy reveals photogenerated electron trapping pathway in ionized states driven by band bending. These findings demonstrate how surface properties, PEC performance, and charge carrier kinetics interrelate, highlighting the significance of band bending modifications.








Abstract
Surface and interface engineering is essential for constructing efficient and stable photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar fuel production. Despite the recent advances in photoelectrode optimization for the practical application, the corresponding interfacial reaction mechanism has not been elucidated owing to a lack of suitable measurements at the semiconductor&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, the key factor for an interfacial reaction in a model system (WO3 photoanode coated with amorphous TiO2 overlayers) is elucidated using operando spectroelectrochemistry. The thin TiO2 overlayers are shown to enhance n&#8208;type semiconductor characteristics and heal the excessive oxygen vacancies on the WO3 photoanode surface, which suggests reduced bulk and surface charge carrier recombination and 1.5&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency. Operando transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the overlayers accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the electrode to the external circuit and increase the population of trapped holes by promoting band bending, which reveals that the kinetic connection between ultrafast phenomena and real water oxidation reaction. Thus, our work elucidates band bending in the space&#8208;charge region as a key factor and provides a major strategy for designing surface&#8208;modified PEC devices.

         <title>SuFEx&#8208;Enabled Polypeptide: Creating Diversified Properties with Minimal Preset Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety can be installed on amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides so that SuFEx click chemistry can be enabled on the corresponding polypeptides. By allowing the use of simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest with minimal preset conditions, and utilizing the functionalities of SuFEx linkages, high throughput preparation of diverse functional polypeptides can be made possible.








Abstract
Facile but effective synthesis and functionalization of polypeptides has long been a challenge, blocking the way to further explorations of their properties and potential applications. Here, we report the incorporation of sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) moiety in amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides, which grant the resulting polypeptides from ring&#8208;opening polymerization the ability to utilize simple hydroxyl and amino groups on functional moieties of interest without the requirement for the introduction of preset conditions, such as reactive molecular anchors. We prepared series of polypeptides modified with sulfates or amidosulfonates (sulfamates), and importantly, we demonstrate that such linkages derived from SuFEx exhibit unique nature, which possibly benefits future biomaterial designs. In addition, the linkages can synergize with incorporated functionalizing moieties, demonstrated in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example in which the sulfate&#8208;linked, saccharide&#8208;modified polypeptides showed outstanding antiviral activity and biocompatibility.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Axial Imaging for Quantifying Piconewton Traction Forces in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a hybrid imaging approach that combines MIET with DNA&#8208;based molecular tension probes to map piconewton cellular traction forces with nanometer axial resolution. This method enables simultaneous visualization of integrin forces and membrane topography in live cells.








Abstract
Cell mechanics play a pivotal role in regulating numerous biological processes. Although super&#8208;resolution microscopy enables the imaging of cellular forces in the lateral dimension with sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm resolution, achieving comparable resolution along the axial dimension remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;induced energy transfer (MIET)&#8208;based tension probe microscopy (MIET&#8208;TPM), a technique for mapping cellular mechanical forces with nanometer precision in the axial direction. This approach combines the nanometer spatial resolution of MIET imaging with the piconewton sensitivity of DNA&#8208;hairpin&#8208;based molecular tension probes (MTPs), enabling the simultaneous observation of both the plasma membrane and force&#8208;exerting molecules in the axial dimension. Using MIET&#8208;TPM, we mapped axial integrin tension within focal adhesions and podosomes, alongside their corresponding plasma membrane height profiles, offering detailed insights into the nanoscale structures and mechanisms involved in force transmission. Notably, MIET&#8208;TPM can be implemented on any fluorescence microscopy setup without hardware modifications, making it a versatile and accessible tool that promises to become an integral part of future cellular mechanobiology&#160;analysis.

We discovered that lophine&#8212;the first historically documented chemiluminescent compound&#8212;can be converted from weak chemiluminescence to bright molecular afterglow by caging its imidazole moiety. This switch greatly enhances its emission intensity, enabling, for the first time, the use of lophine derivatives for in vivo imaging applications, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and monitoring adipose tissue changes induced by the GLP&#8208;1 agonist Semaglutide

Abstract
Lophine, the first chemiluminescent compound discovered in history, has rarely been applied for in vivo imaging since its discovery in 1877. In this report, we demonstrate that lophine's chemiluminescence emission could be significantly enhanced by caging the imidazole moiety via molecular afterglow mechanism. Notably, our study revealed a rare superoxide anion&#8208;mediated luminescence. Our novel probes JIMI&#8208;11 and JIMI&#8208;12 could be used for in vivo mouse imaging. Compared to its uncaged form JIMI&#8208;6, JIMI&#8208;11 exhibited a significant enhancement (126&#8208;fold) in vitro and a 190&#8208;fold higher emission signal in vivo. JIMI&#8208;11 selectively accumulates in white adipose tissues (WAT) and can be used to monitor changes in WAT mass in a mouse model of type&#8208;1 diabetes. Additionally, it can assess the therapeutic effects of Semaglutide in a mouse model of diet&#8208;induced obesity. Lastly, we designed JIMI&#8208;12 with a reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) responsive moiety as the caging group and demonstrated its utility for in vivo imaging of ROS in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory mouse model. Our studies suggest that re&#8208;designing lophine&#8208;based probes could unlock their potential for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The ability to switch from chemiluminescence to molecular afterglow introduces a novel approach to designing imaging probes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a tert&#8208;butyl functionalized ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with high crystallinity and a large surface area. Static adsorption and dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate excellent SF6 adsorption performance and high SF6/N2 selectivity, underscoring the importance of pore surface engineering for enhanced SF6/N2 separation efficiency.








Abstract
Efficient capture and recovery of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is critical for mitigating greenhouse effects and promoting gas recycling in the electronics industry. Herein, we report a novel ultra&#8208;microporous three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF), termed CPOF&#8208;12, enriched with tert&#8208;butyl groups. CPOF&#8208;12 exhibits a Brunauer&#8722;Emmett&#8722;Teller (BET) surface area of 1,140&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, a pore volume of 0.66&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, and a uniform pore size of 0.59&#160;nm, which closely matches the kinetic diameter of SF6 (0.52&#160;nm). Gas adsorption measurements reveal a high SF6 uptake of 2.20&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, along with an exceptional SF6/N2 selectivity of 149.4, calculated using ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). This study highlights the effectiveness of pore surface engineering in COFs for high&#8208;performance separation of greenhouse gases.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Hybrid of Viruses and Supramolecular Peptide Fibers for Multidimensional Control of Patterning and Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid of a bacteriophage virus and a helical supramolecular fiber, composed of an amphiphilic peptide containing an azobenzene group (A2Az), as a virus hybridizable self&#8208;assembling peptide is reported. The hybrid undergoes disassembly by photo&#8208;induced depolymerization of the A2Az fiber, which enables site&#8208;selective control of the adhesion and infection behaviors of the bacteriophage not only on 2D substrates but also in 3D hydrogel environments.








Abstract
Viruses are versatile colloidal materials in their biofunctions, monodispersed and periodic structures, and high surface designability. For expanding the applicability of virus&#8208;based materials, spatiotemporally controlled immobilization and dispersion of viruses with retained activity should be useful, though control of the dynamic nature of viruses hybridized with commonly used polymers has been difficult due to their strong interactions. Here, we report a self&#8208;assembling peptide (A2Az) enabling photo control of adhesion and dispersion of M13 bacteriophage virus (M13 phage) and successfully demonstrate patterning of localization and infection of the virus. A2Az is a cationic peptide with amphiphilicity that consists of eight amino acid residues containing a photo&#8208;responsive azobenzene group at the second position and self&#8208;assembles into a helical supramolecular fiber to form a hydrogel. The helical fibrillar morphology of A2Az exhibits strong interaction with M13 phage, allowing for immobilization not only on a two&#8208;dimensional surface but also in a three&#8208;dimensional hydrogel with suppression of infectivity. The A2Az fiber undergoes a light&#8208;triggered fiber&#8208;to&#8208;particle transition and releases the immobilized M13 phage with retained infectivity for the photo&#8208;controlled patterning of localization and infection. This approach has potential applicability to various virus&#8208;based biomaterials, such as structural materials and materials for photo&#8208;selective gene transfection to cells.

         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;free hydroaminomethylation of long&#8208;chain olefins in water is achieved by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;iridium catalyst without high&#8208;pressure H2 and organic solvent, affording linear amines with good yields and high linear/branch selectivities. This approach provides a simple, straightforward, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective method for the synthesis of higher (deuterium) amines and derivatives.








Abstract
Aqueous hydroaminomethylation (HAM) of olefins generally requires the use of organic solvents, additives, and high&#8208;pressure hydrogen to synthesize amines in satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we accomplish the HAM reactions of long&#8208;chain olefins in water without organic solvent or additives by using a hydrophilic bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;Ir complex as the catalyst. A broad scope of long&#8208;chain olefins and amines is well compatible, affording corresponding higher amines in up to 99% yields with excellent linear/branched (l/b) selectivity (up to 94/6). Mechanistic investigations reveal that water acts as both solvent and hydrogen source. The protocol can be readily extended to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and deuterated analogues with excellent yields and deuterium rates. Moreover, the amine products are easily separated by extraction, and the recovered aqueous phase could be directly used and recycled. This protocol offers a sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective approach for synthesizing higher amines.

         <title>Boosting Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion over Copper&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts by Facilitating Hydrogenation and Product Desorption</title>

Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O with oxalate modification is synthesized as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction. By integrating the facilitated NO3&#8722; adsorption and hydrogenation, promoted NH3 desorption and impeded side reactions, an excellent performance is achieved with an NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 97.49% in neutral condition.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a sustainable route for ammonia (NH3) production and water purification. For the most extensively investigated Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts that favor NO3&#8722; adsorption, insufficient hydrogenation capability and sluggish NH3 desorption hinder the ultimate performance. Herein, we report Ca&#8208;doped Cu2O co&#8208;modified by oxalate (Ca&#9472;Cu2O&#9472;OA) as a novel and high&#8208;performance NitRR electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the Ca dopant with strong hydration effect facilitates the hydrogenation steps of adsorbed NO3&#8722; on the adjacent Cu active sites. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between OA and adsorbed NH3 promotes the product desorption. Together with the strong NO3&#8722; adsorption capability and inhibited hydrogen evolution as a side reaction, excellent NitRR performance with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.49% and a high NH3 yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is achieved in neutral condition, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) in neutral condition offers a sustainable route for ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) production and water purification. For the most extensively investigated Cu-based electrocatalysts that favor NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption, insufficient hydrogenation capability and sluggish NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; desorption hinder the ultimate performance. Herein, we report Ca-doped Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O co-modified by oxalate (Ca&#9472;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#9472;OA) as a novel and high-performance NitRR electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the Ca dopant with strong hydration effect facilitates the hydrogenation steps of adsorbed NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the adjacent Cu active sites. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between OA and adsorbed NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; promotes the product desorption. Together with the strong NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption capability and inhibited hydrogen evolution as a side reaction, excellent NitRR performance with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 97.49% and a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 15.02&#160;mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in neutral condition, outperforming most reported electrocatalysts.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Fluorination in Dual&#8208;Halogen Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: A Case Study of New Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of dual&#8208;halogen solid electrolytes (SEs), based on a new Pnma phase of Li2HfCl6. By systematically fluorinating it to various degrees, Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 was identified as the optimal formulation. ASSBs assembled using it as the catholyte exhibited greatly enhanced electrochemical stability compared to those employing Li2HfCl6. We explicitly demonstrate that this is due to the formation of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated, LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, not enhanced anodic stability of the catholyte.








Abstract
Lithium metal chlorides are promising superionic conductors for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) due to their favorable mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, and good oxidative stability (up to &gt;4.2&#160;V versus Li/Li+). Nonetheless, chloride solid electrolytes (SEs) still undergo electrochemical degradation when paired with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2. A viable strategy to enhance the intrinsic electrochemical stability of chloride electrolytes is to partially substitute Cl with F. By leveraging complementary insights from neutron and X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemical studies, we investigate the interplay between ionic and electronic conductivity, voltage stability, and overall battery performance of a family of new dual&#8208;halogen SEs&#8212;Li2HfCl6&#8722;xFx. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells utilizing Li2HfCl5.5F0.5 as the electrolyte demonstrate much&#8208;enhanced battery performance compared to Li2HfCl6. This improvement is mainly attributed to the formation of a kinetically stable LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which inhibits detrimental reactions between the cathode and the SE, as revealed by ToF&#8208;SIMS studies. The findings from this study are applicable to other dual&#8208;halogen solid ionic conductors, offering valuable insights into the relationship between intrinsic electrochemical window (IEW), electronic and ionic conductivity, and battery performance in dual&#8208;halogen solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Identification of a Selective YTHDF1 Inhibitor Targeting the m6A Recognition Domain for Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered SKLB&#8208;Y13, a selective YTHDF1 inhibitor that binds to the m6A recognition pocket and disrupts m6A&#8208;dependent YTHDF1&#8211;mRNA interactions. SKLB&#8208;Y13 shows potent cellular activity and selectivity in breast cancer models, with chemoproteomic profiling confirming its high target specificity.








Abstract
As a key N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) reader, YTH domain&#8208;containing family protein 1 (YTHDF1) promotes protein synthesis by recognizing m6A&#8208;modified mRNA, and its abnormal expression is closely related to breast cancer (BC) progression. To date, the scarce reported YTHDF1 inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity and limited potency, primarily due to the high homology of the YTH domain within the YTHDF family, which poses significant challenges for the discovery of subtype&#8208;selective inhibitors. Here, we report SKLB&#8208;Y13, the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitor achieving exclusive targeting of the YTHDF1 m6A&#8208;binding pocket&#160;(IC50&#160;=&#160;0.76 &#181;M), via structural optimization of a novel 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrothieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridine scaffold.&#160;Uniquely, SKLB&#8208;Y13 interacts with YTHDF1&#8208;specific residues Tyr397 and Trp470, as confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and demonstrates improved selectivity for YTHDF1 over YTH family proteins. Cellular and in vivo studies reveal that&#160;SKLB&#8208;Y13 disrupts YTHDF1&#8208;PRPF6 mRNA interaction in an m6A&#8208;dependent manner, thereby impairing the translation of PRPF6 and inhibiting BC proliferation while promoting apoptosis. Chemical proteomics profiling confirms its good target specificity, while pharmacokinetic analysis shows favorable in vivo properties.&#160;This study introduces the first selective YTHDF1 inhibitor, serving as a&#160;novel chemical probe&#160;to elucidate m6A&#8208;dependent oncogenesis and a promising starting point for developing precision therapies against YTHDF1&#8208;overexpressing BC.

         <title>Quest for Luminescent Low&#8208;Spin Chromium(I) Complexes with Doublet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States</title>

Paramagnetic low&#8208;spin d5 Cr(I) complexes prepared by chemical oxidation from their Cr(0) precursors were found luminescent in solutions and the emissions were tentatively assigned to be doublet MLCT in nature.








Abstract
Two paramagnetic Cr(I) complexes with homoleptic fac&#8208;bis(triarylisocyanide) ligands were prepared by chemical oxidation of the Cr(0) precursors and emission spectra with peak maximum at respective 568 and 525&#160;nm have been recorded with THF solutions of these two low&#8208;spin d5 metal complexes at 298&#160;K. Structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies revealed that the emission of the Cr(I) complexes could be tentatively assigned to be spin&#8208;allowed 2MLCT excited states. Femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra confirmed that the lifetimes of the excited states were in the tens of picoseconds, which could be explained by the fast nonradiative decay of 2MLCT state through low&#8208;lying quartet metal&#8208;centered (4MC) states. The Cr(I) complexes with luminescent 2MLCT excited states were distinct from the previously reported d5 Fe(III) complexes with luminescent 2LMCT excited states, enriching the diversity of emissive excited states of earth&#8208;abundant 3d transition metal complexes.

The successful installation of planar camptothecin (CPT) into PC&#8208;type phospholipids enables the controlled self&#8208;assembly of these molecules into well&#8208;defined supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths. We highlight the potential of phospholipid nanotubes as a versatile platform for targeted chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;organization of amphiphilic phospholipid camptothecin (CPT) conjugates (named PCCs) selectively forms supramolecular nanotubes with varying lengths and polydispersity. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanisms governing PCC assembly, demonstrating that &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions derived from the planar, conjugated structure of CPT play a pivotal role in nanotube formation. Precise modulation of the hydrophobic characteristics of PCC linkers enables fine&#8208;tuning of &#960;&#8208;stacking strength, thereby controlling the length of the nanotubes, ranging from the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale. With exceptionally high drug&#8208;loading efficiencies (43.9% to 52.3%) and stimulus&#8208;responsive release properties, the optimized PCC nanotubes exhibit tumor&#8208;selective cytotoxicity of 20&#8208; to 50&#8208;fold greater potency against tumor cells compared to normal cells. Furthermore, PCC nanotubes of intermediate length (0.3&#8211;0.5&#160;&#181;m) display prolonged circulation times than conventional liposomes, resulting in enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting and therapeutic efficacy.

The antioxidant strategy is employed to achieve the all&#8208;air preparation of organic solar cells (OSCs) by doping the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH into PDINN. C60&#8208;OH significantly affects the film&#8208;forming process of PDINN and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the stability of PDINN:C60&#8208;OH, an impressive efficiency of 20.22% is attained, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in air&#8208;processed (o&#8208;xylene) OSCs.








Abstract
The pronounced efficiency disparity between ambient&#8208;air&#8208;fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) and nitrogen&#8208;glovebox&#8208;processed devices poses a major obstacle to industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. The instability of the organic electron transport layer (ETL) materials in air undoubtedly affects the carrier transport properties, which significantly reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Here, based on the antioxidant strategy, the stability of PDINN in air is enhanced by doping PDINN with the antioxidant C60&#8208;OH, thereby successfully achieving the all&#8208;air preparation of OSCs. Eventually, the PCE of the air&#8208;prepared green OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:PTQ10:BTP&#8208;eC9 (o&#8208;xylene) achieves 19.35% and 20.22%, respectively, after being optimized by the antioxidant strategy. Moreover, C60&#8208;OH remarkably improves the operational stability of the device in air with a T80 lifetime of over 1060&#160;h, which is higher than that of undoped device (416&#160;h). Furthermore, the PCE of large&#8208;area (25&#160;cm2) modules based on PDINN:C60&#8208;OH attains 16.47%. This study highlights the potential of the antioxidant strategy to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic photovoltaics in air, significantly promoting the development of OSCs.

         <title>General Synthesis of 2D Mesoporous Multimetal Spinel Supracrystals for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general and modular strategy for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with well&#8208;defined mesoporous surfaces and compositions that range from unary to multinary oxides. Leveraging multimetal electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D geometry, mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are demonstrated as interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, which deliver exceptional electrochemical performance under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous metal oxide crystals that integrate atomic&#8208;level single crystallinity with ordered mesoporosity represent a promising but rarely realized class of materials, particularly in multicomponent systems. Here, we report a universal strategy for synthesizing freestanding 2D mesoporous spinel supracrystals with tunable compositions, spanning from unary to multinary spinel oxide systems. This approach decouples crystalline framework formation from mesopore generation, combining emulsion&#8208;mediated, on&#8208;surface crystallization of 2D nanocrystal superlattices with thermally&#8208;induced collective nanocrystal reorientation and facet&#8208;selective epitaxial fusion. Concurrent surface reconstruction exposes {110} facets along nanocrystal edges, which define the internal surfaces of vertically aligned mesopores. As a proof of concept, 2D mesoporous FeMnCoO supracrystals are employed as functional interlayers in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. These interlayers demonstrate strong polysulfide adsorption, accelerated redox kinetics, and enhanced Li+ ion transport, enabled by their multimetal&#8208;induced electronic modulation, facet&#8208;specific catalytic activity, and 2D mesoporous architecture. As a result, Li&#8211;S cells equipped with FeMnCoO&#8208;modified separators deliver exceptional electrochemical performance, even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. This work addresses a longstanding challenge in reconciling ordered mesoporosity with crystallographic coherence in mesoporous materials, establishing a molecularly modular approach for synthesizing 2D mesoporous spinel crystals with programmable compositions and facet&#8208;engineered functionality.

         <title>Tailoring Low&#8208;Miller&#8208;Index Crystal Facets Realizes Perovskite Solar Cells with Flat Grain&#8208;boundary Grooves</title>

Diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules tailored low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets, flattened grain&#8208;boundary grooves and reduced nanoscale physical voids, thus enabling 26.80% efficiency perovskite solar cells with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Charge transport and nonradiative recombination loss at the buried interface are important factors, which limit the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we screen a series of diphosphate Lewis&#8208;base molecules, where N,N&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (N&#8208;DPPM) with appropriate alkyl chains and multiple active sites not only can efficiently facilitate carrier transport but also coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and interact with FA+ through N&#8943;H bond. These features prompt the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films along (100)/(200) crystal facets. Interestingly, these oriented low&#8208;Miller&#8208;index crystal facets have approximately a twice&#8208;increase in heterointerface energy and twice&#8208;decrease in grain&#8208;boundary energy, flattening grain&#8208;boundary grooves, thereby reducing nanoscale physical voids and releasing residual stress. Consequently, the champion inverted PSCs exhibit impressive power conversion efficiencies of 26.80%, 26.18%, and 20.59% for narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.55&#160;eV), large&#8208;area (0.5&#160;cm2), and wide&#8208;bandgap (1.73&#160;eV) devices, respectively. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent stability after long&#8208;term storage, thermal&#8208;aging, or light&#8208;soaking.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of nucleophilic 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and 2,3&#8208;unsaturated C&#8208;glycosides in good yields with excellent selectivity. A DFT&#8208;assisted, data&#8208;driven predictive model was established to guide rational ligand design, laying a solid foundation for future advances in regiodivergent glycosylation.








Abstract
The selective modification of carbohydrates to achieve structural complexity has emerged as a crucial strategy in carbohydrate&#8208;based drug development. However, the intricate stereochemistry and densely packed functional groups of carbohydrates pose significant challenges for precise stereoselectivity and regioselectivity control. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, stereospecific, and ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals, establishing a robust platform for glycoside diversification with versatile C1 and C3 modification. Notably, stable 3&#8208;boryl&#8208;glycals with 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraethylethylene glycol protection were first synthesized and fully characterized. Operating under mild conditions, this reaction enables the efficient synthesis of diverse 2,3&#8208;unsaturated aryl/alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Importantly, this ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent C&#8208;glycosylation offers a concise and efficient strategy for accessing 3&#8208;C&#8208;glycals (C3&#8208;arylated/alkenylated glycals), circumventing time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step sequences. To elucidate the origins of regioselectivity control, we employ a data&#8208;driven approach integrating DFT&#8208;assisted multivariate regression analysis, identifying key ligand parameters that govern regioselectivity. Leveraging this predictive model, we pursued rational ligand design to enhance C3&#8208;glycosylation selectivity and yield. Additionally, density functional theory calculations (DFT) provide critical insights into the fundamental principles dictating regioselectivity and tunability. These findings establish a solid foundation for advancing ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent glycosylation reactions and significantly expand the synthetic toolkit for glycochemical synthesis.

         <title>Corral[n]Bicarbazoles: Redox&#8208;Active Chiral Macrocycles for Air&#8208;Stable Radical Cations Formation and Guest Capture/Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active macrocycles were synthesized employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units, showing excellent chiropotical propreties and hosting ability. These macrocycles generate stable radical cations upon oxidation and enable redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release via their electron&#8208;rich, deep cavity.








Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are pivotal in both supramolecular chemistry and materials science, as their preorganized cavities enable selective molecular recognition, while their cyclic frameworks facilitate electronic and spatial coupling of monomeric units to yield advanced optoelectronic and magnetic properties. However, macrocycles that combine exceptional host&#8211;guest recognition with these properties remain rare and challenging to design. Herein, we report the synthesis of three pairs of enantiopure, redox&#8208;active, conjugated macrocycles, termed corral[n]bicarbazole, employing axially chiral 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole units. These macrocycles display strong blue emission (quantum yields up to 78% in THF) and pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 10&#8722;3). Notably, controlled oxidation of corral[n]bicarbazoles generates their mono&#8208; and polyradical cations with exceptional air stability (half&#8208;lives up to five days) and intriguing magnetic properties. The electron&#8208;rich deep&#8208;cavity of corral[4]bicarbazole confers strong hosting ability (Ka = 104&#8211;105 M&#8722;1) toward cationic guests, facilitating redox&#8208;responsive guest capture/release. By integrating a chiroptical, redox&#8208;active backbone with a switchable recognition cavity, corral[n]bicarbazoles offer a versatile platform for advancing interdisciplinary innovation, with potential applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and smart supramolecular materials.

         <title>HerTACs Enable Tumor&#8208;Selective Lysosomal Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins via HER2 Trafficking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI&#8208;guided design of HER2&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs) enables selective degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins in HER2+ tumors. These stapled peptide&#8208;based degraders harness HER2&#8208;mediated trafficking to deliver programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) into lysosomes, offering a broadly applicable and clinically promising strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). 








Abstract
Targeting extracellular and membrane proteins for degradation remains a frontier challenge in the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD), largely due to the intracellular confinement of existing proteolysis systems and reliance on bulky biologics. Here, we develop a novel TPD platform, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted lysosome&#8208;tethering chimeras (HerTACs), which co&#8208;opts the tumor overexpressed, endocytic, and lysosomal trafficking capability of HER2. Starting from the HER2&#8208;binding peptide LTVSPWY, we engineered the first&#8208;generation HerTAC (LP), a conjugate of the HER2&#8208;binding peptide and a PD&#8208;L1 ligand, to degrade programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) in HER2&#8208;positive cells. Guided by AlphaFold modeling and alanine scanning, we developed a stapled peptide&#8208;based HerTAC (L2,5P) with enhanced degradative&#160;efficacy (DC50&#160;=&#160;156&#160;nM), stability, and pharmacokinetics. HerTAC L2,5P showed potent antitumor activity and low systemic toxicity in HER2+ breast cancer animal models. The HerTAC strategy was further extended to other clinically relevant inaccessible membrane and extracellular targets (i.e., V&#8208;domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation [VISTA] and macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]), highlighting its generality and broad applicability. This work establishes a tumor&#8208;selective, lysosome&#8208;directed TPD strategy that expands the druggable proteome and offers a clinically transformable approach for precision oncology.

Abstract
An efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated iron&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction between CH2Br2 and various alkenes has been developed. This transformation provides direct access to synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;dibromo compounds with excellent atom economy under mild reaction conditions. The protocol demonstrates remarkable versatility, exhibiting broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Notably, the obtained 1,3&#8208;dibromo products function as highly versatile synthetic building blocks. Through rationally designed one&#8208;pot multistep transformations, these intermediates can be conveniently converted into structurally diverse derivatives, including oxetanes and allyl bromides, directly from terminal alkenes.

The discovery of ligands that selectively target closely related protein families or isoforms remains a critical challenge. A protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy, enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL), yielded nanomolar, highly selective inhibitors of PTP1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site.








Abstract
Capture agents that selectively bind to biological targets are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biomedical research. However, discovering such capture agents, particularly for structurally conserved or challenging targets, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a protein&#8208;templated in situ click strategy enabled by a nanoparticle&#8208;based DNA&#8208;encoded library (nanoDEL) platform. The nanoDEL enables the construction and screening of vastly large, chemically diverse combinatorial libraries with high redundancy, far exceeding the scale and throughput of conventional approaches, such as one&#8208;bead&#8208;one&#8208;compound and solution&#8208;phase in situ click methods. Thus, this enables the rapid and efficient identification of high&#8208;affinity, high&#8208;selectivity ligands in a single selection round, eliminating the need for iterative screening. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we performed an in situ click screening of a 27&#8208;million&#8208;member nanoDEL of azido&#8208;functionalized peptoids, in the presence of a weak and promiscuous alkyne&#8208;bearing anchor ligand. This yielded bidentate inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, a challenging target due to its highly conserved active site. These inhibitors exhibited nanomolar potency and exceptional selectivity over closely related phosphatases. This work represents a broadly applicable strategy for discovering high&#8208;performance capture agents, particularly for selectively targeting closely related protein families or isoforms where achieving selectivity remains a critical challenge.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Screening&#8208;Guided Core&#8208;Shell RuO2@TaOx Nanorods Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the limitations of conventional experimental method, which are often time&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive, a multi&#8208;step systematic screening strategy guides the selection of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as protective layers for RuO2 in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The relevant core&#8208;shell structures are subsequently designed, where interfacial synergy promotes both catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
In the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the exploration of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is essential for the environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. Although RuO2 exhibits high catalytic activity, its solubility and corrosion in acidic environments are of concern. In this study, high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides were multi&#8208;step rationally screened as protective layers for RuO2 to identify their roles in the acidic OER process. Among them, Ta&#8208;related oxide was selected as the best candidate. To demonstrate the theoretical predictions, RuO2@TaOx with a core&#8208;shell structure was deployed, which exhibited low overpotentials of 163 and 232&#160;mV at 10&#160; and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In fact, the dense amorphous TaOx layer effectively prevented the dissolution of RuO2 and optimized the charge transfer through interfacial synergy, significantly improving both the activity and durability of OER. Meanwhile, the operando quick X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Quick&#8208;XAS) confirmed that Ru served as the active site during OER, while Ta inhibited the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru, correlating with theoretical considerations. This study provides a new paradigm using targeted computational screening to guide the design of advanced catalysts, and serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the deployment of high&#8208;melting&#8208;point metal oxides as a protective layer for RuO2 in the acidic OER.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Insensitive Solvation Chemistry Stabilizes High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a solvophilic diluent&#8208;modulated electrolyte model for electric field&#8208;insensitive electrolyte chemistry. The electrolyte decouples solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields and maintains Li+&#8208;solvent coordination integrity via mutual hydrogen bonding, enabling remarkable success in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether based electrolytes are promising for the realization of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs). However, the oxidation chemistry of these electrolytes stemming from the disruption to solvent coordination by interfacial electric&#8208;field remains unresolved and challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that reinforcing the interactions between solvent and diluent to decouple solvation dynamics from interfacial electric fields could maintain Li&#8314;&#8208;solvent coordination integrity and drastically diminish uncoordinated solvents, thereby increasing electrolyte anodic stability. To realize this concept, we identify a class of solvophilic diluents (SPDs, whose interaction energies with solvent&gt;3.3&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) to strongly anchor diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) solvent at electrified interfaces via mutually reinforcing H(DEGDME)&#183;&#183;&#183;F/O(SPD) and H(SPD)&#183;&#183;&#183;O(DEGDME) interactions and effectively decrease dipole moment of DEGDME (&lt;&#160;2.47&#160;D), creating an electric field&#8208;insensitive solvation environment wherein the O&#9472;H/C&#9472;H bond polarization of DEGDME is dramatically impeded. Remarkably, our designed SPD&#8208;assisted electrolyte mediated by electric field&#8208;insensitive methyl nonafluorobutyl ether exhibits outstanding anodic stability, endowing 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 30&#160;&#181;m Li||2.1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell with 80% capacity retention after 168 cycles&#8208;an improvement over the 90 cycles achieved with a Li friendly electrolyte. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for manipulating interfacial solvation dynamics to unlock high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Bionic Design of Ni4+ Lewis Acid Site Based on Selective Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants for survival, we have designed an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich catalyst that can &#8220;ripen&#8221; to a highly active state (Ni4+). This state selectively attracts hydroxide ions and repels chloride ions, thereby achieving efficient and stable seawater electrolysis and avoiding corrosion.








Abstract
The side reaction caused by chloride ions and the toxicity to the active site have always been the hindrance to the electrocatalyst of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for seawater splitting. Herein, inspired by the early flowering of damaged plants, we designed a catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies (Ovac) and proved that Ovac can accelerate the formation of Ni3+ and further oxidize it to Ni4+, which we named as the &#8220;ripening&#8221; mechanism of Ovac. Ovac reduces the hydrogen proton desorption energy by regulating local charge redistribution, thus realizing the rapid transformation of Ni2+&#8594;Ni3+&#8594;Ni4+. Meanwhile, the hard Lewis acid Ni4+ has strong selectivity to OH&#8722;, avoiding the competitiveness and corrosiveness of chloride ions in seawater. This work provides an effective strategy for the simple and rapid construction of self&#8208;rebuilding high&#8208;valence Ni4+ electrocatalysts, and is expected to provide guidance for the development of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Kirkendall Effect&#8208;Driven Interface Engineering Facilitates Water Dissociation for Dual&#8208;Site H2O2 Electrosynthesis Simultaneously at the Anode and Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Kirkendall effect&#8208;driven interfacial engineering strategy was developed to construct NiZnOx&#9472;C catalysts with exposed (100) facets. The incorporation of hetero&#8208;nanocluster NiOx induced built&#8208;in electric fields and enriched oxygen vacancies, which synergistically promoted the spontaneous dissociation of water and subsequent formation of *H and *OH radicals. These interfacial features collectively optimized the thermodynamics and kinetics of both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) pathways for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The direct integration of renewable energy into H2O2 electrosynthesis systems offers a promising strategy to minimize energy losses and costs. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy, the dual&#8208;site catalysts must efficiently enable both the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR).

     alt="Kirkendall Effect-Driven Interface Engineering Facilitates Water Dissociation for Dual-Site H2O2 Electrosynthesis Simultaneously at the Anode and Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kirkendall effect-driven interfacial engineering strategy was developed to construct NiZnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;C catalysts with exposed (100) facets. The incorporation of hetero-nanocluster NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; induced built-in electric fields and enriched oxygen vacancies, which synergistically promoted the spontaneous dissociation of water and subsequent formation of *H and *OH radicals. These interfacial features collectively optimized the thermodynamics and kinetics of both the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR) pathways for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct integration of renewable energy into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis systems offers a promising strategy to minimize energy losses and costs. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy, the dual-site catalysts must efficiently enable both the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) and water oxidation reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR). The Kirkendall effect was employed to engineer interfaces and construct a NiZnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;C catalyst with exposed (100) facets. The hetero-cluster NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; induces oxygen vacancies and built-in electric fields, which facilitate water activation and subsequent formation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, thereby enabling a single catalyst to rapidly electrosynthesize H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at both the anode and cathode. Notably, 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR on the cathode enabled rapid synthesis of high-concentration H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (33987&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 33.18&#160;mol g&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). NiZnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;C achieves stable 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR/WOR coupling in a continuous-flow reactor, operating reliably for 4 h under simulated alternating current (AC) and peaking at a total Faradaic efficiency of 150.9% under amperage-level direct currents.

         <title>Bioinspired Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel With Localized Ice Regulation for Subzero Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms, we develop a bioinspired anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel by embedding bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP)&#8208;loaded microgels (BGEL) into an ice binding protein (IBP)&#8208;containing PAMAC matrix. BMIP triggers localized ice nucleation in BGEL, while IBP suppresses further growth, spatially confining ice within BGEL. This ensures BGEL freezes at subzero temperatures but the surrounding PAMAC matrix remains unfrozen.








Abstract
Freezing hydrogels at subzero temperatures severely compromises mechanical flexibility, ionic conductivity, and structural integrity, thereby limiting their application in low&#8208;temperature environments. Hydrogel freezing involves both ice nucleation and ice growth; however, simultaneously inhibiting these two processes remains a significant challenge. In nature, freeze&#8208;tolerant organisms do not rely on completely preventing ice formation to survive freezing conditions. Instead, they utilize bacterial membrane&#8208;anchored ice nucleating protein (BMIP) to promote ice nucleation and ice binding protein (IBP) to regulate ice growth, thereby achieving freeze protection through precise ice management. Inspired by this biological strategy of &#8220;selective nucleation of small ice crystals with restricted growth,&#8221; we developed anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels by incorporating both BMIP and IBP. The anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical and electrical performance at low temperatures, with a non&#8208;freezing matrix stable down to &#8722;30&#176;C and excellent structural integrity over multiple freeze&#8208;thaw cycles. When employed as a functional component of a robotic hand designed for low&#8208;temperature operation and integrated with machine learning algorithms, the anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels enable precise recognition of object stiffness and size under ultra&#8208;low temperature conditions. This bioinspired approach provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;freezing hydrogels capable of supporting stable human&#8208;robot&#8208;environment interactions in harsh, low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Accessing Strain Engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH from Prussian Blue Analogue Precatalyst for Efficient Anodic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to precisely modulate the electronic structure of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst to access a strain&#8208;engineered V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst for anodic oxidation reactions. 








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are promising precatalysts to access active metal oxyhydroxide [M(O)OH] phases for anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this study, we have introduced a d&#8208;d electron complementation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of a VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst. Spectroscopic studies revealed the altered coordination and electronic features of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst compared to the FeFe&#8208;PBA counterpart. The electrochemical activation of the VOFe&#8208;PBA precatalyst led to the formation of a strained V&#8208;Fe(O)OH active catalyst. Notably, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH demonstrated exceptional performance, requiring a potential of only 1.56&#160;V versus RHE for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 1.42&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) at a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the Fe(O)OH. When employed in IOR&#8208;assisted water splitting, V&#8208;Fe(O)OH achieved an energy efficiency of 60% compared to overall water splitting. In&#8208;situ Raman studies reflected the potential dependent generation of active reaction intermediates, which participated in IOR to produce iodate. Mechanistic investigations suggested the involvement of a lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) facilitated by a proton&#8208;decoupled electron transfer (PDET) pathway.

         <title>Bidirectional Electron Relay at TiN&#8208;TiO2 Interfaces Enables Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Ru for High&#8208;Potential Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based catalysts face catastrophic activity loss above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to oxidation and OH over&#8208;adsorption. A TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;derived charge&#8208;relay is proposed to realize potential&#8208;adaptive electronic regulation of Ru sites, spatially isolating Had/OHad and enabling metallic Ru0 preservation above 1.0&#160;V. This dual&#8208;phase design achieves unprecedented 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V and resolves the fundamental oxidation&#8208;driven deactivation.








Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;based catalysts are pivotal as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to Pt for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, they typically face irreversible deactivation above 0.2&#160;V vs. RHE due to synergistic Ru oxidation/OHad over&#8208;adsorption. We propose a Taichi&#8208;inspired TiN&#8208;TiO2 heterophase&#8208;segregated electron&#8208;relay mechanism that dynamically balances bidirectional electron flow (Ru&#8594;TiN electron donation and TiO2&#8594;Ru electron replenishment), achieving complete activity retention (100%) even under 1.1&#160;V operation. This potential&#8208;adaptive regulation can significantly inhibit electron redistribution and band compression under the high potential induced electric field, and effectively alleviate the d&#8208;band upshift and OH adsorption energy surge. Spatially decoupled Ti(TiN)&#8208;Ru bridge sites simultaneously adsorb OHad (Eads = &#8208;1.40&#160;eV) and decouple Had/OHad adsorption domains, eliminating competitive binding. This configuration delivers triple synergies: 1) geometric isolation of reactive intermediates adsorption, 2) potential&#8208;responsive Ru0 stabilization, and 3) accelerated Volmer kinetics via interfacial hydroxyl migration. The Ru/TiN&#8208;TiO2 catalyst achieves 100% activity retention at 1.1&#160;V vs. RHE (vs. &gt;60% loss for Ru/TiN) with 73.23% metallic Ru0 preserved after 10&#160;h operation. This work resolves the intrinsic activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in Ru HOR catalysts and establishes dynamic charge&#8208;relay interfaces as a universal design paradigm for oxidation&#8208;prone electrocatalysts.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Hybrid Ethylene Glycol Side Chains: A Solution to Water Related Challenges in n&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>

         <dc:description>
To address water related challenges in n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), we proposed an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. As a result, fag&#8208;modified OMIECs achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* value of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and maintain 68% performance after 50&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a novel pathway for developing high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.








Abstract
The water molecule is regarded as a double&#8208;edged sword in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs), particularly for n&#8208;type semiconductors. On the one hand, hydration facilitates ion transport within OMIECs; on the other hand, water acts as an electron trap, capturing electrons in n&#8208;type materials. Excessive hydration may disrupt the continuity of OMIECs crystalline domains, leading to device degradation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative strategy by incorporating perfluoroalkyl hybridized ethylene glycol (fag) side chains into the polymer. The strong hydrophobicity of fluoroalkyl segments effectively repels water from polymer backbone, thereby reducing electron trapping. Meanwhile, the ethylene glycol components facilitate efficient ion transport. These findings are confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D). Additionally, the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of fluorine lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which in turn enhances stability in aqueous environments. We also discovered that the incorporation of fag side chains also promotes polymer self&#8208;assembly and improves crystallinity. Grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals a face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on mixed orientation in fag&#8208;based polymers, facilitating efficient ion&#8208;electron transport. Consequently, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) fabricated from fag&#8208;based OMIECs demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type performance, achieving a &#181;C* figure of merit of 189.78&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, they exhibit excellent stability, retaining 68% of their initial performance after 50&#160;000 switching cycles in aqueous electrolyte. This study demonstrates that a rational approach to molecular design can effectively alleviate the detrimental effects of water, providing a novel strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>Bidirectional Hydrogen Spillover Enables High Activity Catalysts for Rechargeable Hydrogen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>

The Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst with low ruthenium loading accelerates the reaction kinetics of HER/HOR in acidic environments via the bidirectional hydrogen spillover mechanism, thereby enabling hydrogen batteries to exhibit excellent activity and stability across a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Rechargeable hydrogen batteries exhibit superior electrochemical activity for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in acidic media compared to alkaline counterparts, making them promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the development of efficient electrocatalysts for both HER and HOR in acidic media remains challenging, as conventional platinum&#8208;based catalysts face intrinsic limitations in simultaneously achieving high activity and long&#8208;term stability under harsh operating conditions. Herein, we introduce a bidirectional hydrogen spillover strategy to enable synergistic bifunctional HER/HOR catalysts for hydrogen batteries. We demonstrate a Ru&#8211;WO3 catalyst grown on Cu foam (Ru&#8211;WO3@CF), where the interaction between Ru and WO3 enables dynamic shuttling of adsorbed hydrogen species under alternating potentials. The Ru&#8211;WO3@CF electrode demonstrates exceptional HER/HOR bifunctionality in acidic media (0.5 M H2SO4), achieving an ultralow HER overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and an HOR current density of 21.5 mA cm&#8722;2 at 50 mV &#8212; both significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The hydrogen battery fabricated with Ru&#8211;WO3@CF demonstrates exceptional performance across a wide range of temperatures. This work aims to explore the feasibility of bidirectional hydrogen spillover in enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activities toward HER/HOR, providing new insights for high&#8208;performance hydrogen batteries.

         <title>A General Strategy to Develop Highly Sensitive FAP&#945; Fluorescent Probes for Invasive Cancer Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the construction of fluorescent probe library and the deep analysis of FAP&#945;&#8217;s structure, we proposed and confirmed that introducing a positive charge onto the fluorophore skeleton could markedly improve the response efficiency of FAP&#945; fluorescent probe. By virtue of the high sensitivity of FQCy7 toward FAP&#945;, we achieved significant differentiation between invasive tumors and benign lesions, as well as minimally invasive foci in paracancerous tissues.








Abstract
Fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) has been reported to be expressed in many carcinoma cells and associated with tumor growth, invasive, and metastasis. However, due to the lack of appropriate fluorescent probes, detecting FAP&#945; with high sensitivity in tumor and clearly delineating tumor margins remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a general design strategy&#8212;introducing a positive charge into the fluorophore skeleton&#8212;for the construction of FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with enhanced sensitivity. Molecular docking simulations and fluorescence spectra revealed that the FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probe with positive charges displayed an improved affinity and sensitivity toward FAP&#945;. As demonstration, FQCy7, featuring two positive charges, NIR fluorescence emission, and large Stokes shift, exhibited a satisfactory sensitivity toward FAP&#945; and was used for the relationship study between FAP&#945; and carcinoma cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that FQCy7 is highly useful in distinguishing invasive tumor from benign lesions and evaluating the precise resection of tumor tissues. This work not only reports an original strategy to design FAP&#945;&#8208;activated fluorescent probes with high sensitivity but also provides a powerful tool for precise tumor detection.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Precise Control of Stacking Configurations in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalysis</title>

A solvent&#8208;assisted precise modulation Zn&#9472;N coordination can control AA and ABC stacking in 2D COFs, enabling enhanced light absorption, charge transport, and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which reveals critical metal&#8208;solvent&#8208;framework interactions and stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships for advanced photocatalysts design.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their high surface areas and precisely tunable physicochemical properties. However, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control over interlayer stacking configurations in 2D COFs, which critically influence charge carrier transport and consequently determine catalytic efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent&#8208;driven strategy to precisely regulate the interlayer stacking configurations of metal&#8208;incorporated 2D COFs, successfully achieving both AA eclipsed (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA) and ABC staggered (COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC) configurations. Notably, by modulating the coordination interactions between solvent 1&#8208;butanol and Zn2+ (within the COFs), the interactions between the Zn2+ and nitrogen atoms (from imine bonds, pyridine, and triazine units) can be precisely tuned, which leads to the formation of AA or ABC stacked 2D COFs. Interestingly, the ABC&#8208;stacked COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC exhibited an extended light absorption and superior charge migration/separation efficiency than those of COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA. As a result, when coupled with Pt co&#8208;catalysts, COF&#8208;TD&#8208;ABC achieved a high hydrogen evolution rate up to 10.92&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, representing a &#8764;3.5&#8208;fold enhancement over COF&#8208;TD&#8208;AA (3.12&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides a fundamental insight into the stacking&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationships in COFs, paving the way for the rational design of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrate over Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Dual Atomic Active Site and Nanostructure Synergy Enhances C&#8211;N Coupling for Urea Production</title>

A bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework with nanoflower&#8208;like architecture is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for urea synthesis. The synergy between dual atomic active sites and nanostructure engineering enables an excellent performance with a urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 via photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrate.








Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 (NitRR&amp;CRR) offers a sustainable approach for urea synthesis and environment remediation. However, there is a lack of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Herein, we report a nanoflower&#8208;like bimetallic porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework superstructure (Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF, TCPP&#160;=&#160;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) as an efficient NitRR&amp;CRR photocatalyst for urea production. Systematical investigations have revealed that the Cu and Co centers serve as the active sites for driving NitRR and CRR, respectively. The high pore volumes of nanoflower architecture can improve the light adsorption, promote the reactant enrichment, and intermediate generation. Consequently, the C&#8211;N coupling process over Cu&#8208;TCPP(Co)&#8208;NF is facilitated with reduced energy barriers and inhibited side reactions, resulting in an unprecedent urea yield of 2459.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents. This study provides new insights into the design of advanced photocatalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Confining the Node Accessibility of Zr&#8208;MOFs Along One&#8208;Dimensional Channels Toward High Water&#8208;Vapor Cycle&#8208;Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle for building Zr&#8208;MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability by deliberately constructing one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels with limited accessibility of Zr6 nodes to water along channel direction was illustrated. Through either shortening or elongating the core of organic linker horizontally, MOFs with high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability were synthesized. The new resultant Zr&#8208;MOF NJTech&#8208;5 shows one of the highest water uptake amount and working capacity.








Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs) with high hydrolytic stability are promising materials for water&#8208;adsorption&#8208;related applications. However, besides hydrolytic stability, cycling stability is also a crucial feature that renders a MOF a good candidate for water adsorption. Through a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels showing high water cycling stability, a principle of confining the accessibility of Zr6 nodes aligning along channel direction in Zr&#8208;MOFs was unveiled. According to this principle, several topologies that regulates Zr6 nodes with chelating formate aligning in a same plane with a distance less than 5.4&#160;&#197; can successfully hinder the introduction of in&#8208;plane water molecules, thus significantly improve the cycling stability of Zr&#8208;MOFs for water adsorption. Along with this principle, we illustrated a linker designing strategy by horizontal extending the core of organic linkers toward the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs with similar node alignment. By either intentionally shortening or elongating the core horizontally, both MOFs shows high water&#8208;vapor cycling stability. Among them, NJTech&#8208;5 (NJTech for Nanjing Tech University) with scu&#8208;topology, presents a water uptake capacity of 0.93&#160;g g&#8722;1 and working capacity of 0.82&#160;g g&#8722;1, making it among the top stable MOFs with high water uptake capacity and a promising candidate for indoor humidity control.

         <title>A Facile and Scalable &#945;&#8208;Diimine Platform for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is employed in the facile, rapid, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts (20 catalysts). These catalysts show boosted activity (4.4&#160;&#215;&#160;108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), enhanced thermostability (up to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weight, enabling scalable polyethylene production from plastic to elastomer and wax and oil.








Abstract
The structural design and facile synthesis of ligands are crucial for the development of innovative catalysts. Advances have enabled the iterative design of benchmark &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts for the synthesis of polyolefins, which represent the largest class of polymers. In this work, a versatile post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategy is introduced for the synthesis of a new family of &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, deviating from the conventional methods. Based on the commercial butanedione ligand backbone that is found in &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts, target groups were introduced into the backbone via a one&#8208;pot substitution reaction. This simple and efficient approach enabled the large&#8208;scale production of the target systems without purification. Using this protocol, 20 new ligands (50&#160;g&#8208;level) and 20 new nickel catalysts were easily and rapidly synthesized. The catalysts demonstrated significant enhancements in their catalytic activities (4.4 &#215; 108&#160;g mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), thermostabilities (from 90 to 150 &#176;C), and polymer molecular weights (8.3&#8208;fold those of polyethylenes produced by the unmodified catalyst) during ethylene polymerization. These improvements are comparable to those achieved through complicated and tedious aniline modifications in pioneering reports, thereby facilitating the kg&#8208;scale synthesis of polyethylenes, varying from semi&#8208;crystalline plastics to thermoplastic elastomers and ultimately to wax&#8208;like and oil&#8208;like products.

         <title>Dienoic&#8208;Acid Coupling Effect Induced Hierarchical Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dienoic acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in situ construct HSL on Zn anode by the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid additives. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond facilitates the self&#8208;decomposition reaction to form the organic&#8208;rich outer layer and the inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer.








Abstract
Rational pre&#8208;design of self&#8208;decomposed electrolyte additives to construct solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) anode confronts enormous challenges, especially for the in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;function relationship and the lack of reasonable design criteria. In this work, the dienoic&#8208;acid coupling effect is innovatively proposed to in&#8208;situ construct a hierarchical SEI layer (HSL) through the structural screening of a series of organic&#8208;acid molecules. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of dual carboxyl and metastable double bond can strengthen the self&#8208;decomposition tendency of trace electrolyte additive to form HSL via chemical and electrochemical reaction. HSL can effectively regulate interfacial H2O environment via hydrogen&#8208;bond anchoring to reduce thermodynamically active H2O, facilitate desolvation kinetics, and uniform Zn2+ diffusion, thus significantly suppressing HER and dendrite growth. As a result, Zn anode with HSL can achieve high average coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 2400 cycles, long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3800&#160;h, and good reversibility under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8211;I2 full battery with HSL displays a long cycling life of 15&#160;000 cycles and successfully powers the portable and wearable instruments. This work opens a novel route to design an advanced interface with fast kinetics by trace electrolyte additive for high&#8208;performance Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Tailoring the Oxygen Vacancy Distribution in Se&#8208;Doped RuOx to Enhance Its Stability in Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of oxygen vacancy (VO) distribution on Ru oxide stability is unclear. We propose a strategy to tailor the distribution of VOs (VOs located away from Se dopants) via urea&#8208;assisted synthesis of Se&#8208;doped RuOx (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx), which optimizes the oxygen evolution mechanism pathway and inhibits Ru dissolution. Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx shows enhanced acidic water oxidation activity and stability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), surpassing the Se&#8208;RuOx with VO adjacent to Se.








Abstract
Developing durable ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) remains challenging due to irreversible Ru dissolution and lattice oxygen instability. Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (VOs), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of VO distribution on the stability of Ru&#8208;based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx) with the presence of urea, showing the VOs distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se&#8208;RuOx), showing VOs distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se&#8208;RuOx. Particularly, Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx delivers a low working voltage (1.62&#160;V@1&#160;A cm&#8722;2) and excellent durability (&gt;1000&#160;h@200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that VOs engage in long&#8208;range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuOx, synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in promising Ru&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Fe Atom to Boost Surface Reaction Kinetics Toward Robust Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomineralization strategy was developed to regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration to a medium&#8208;spin state, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe SAs influences its orbital orientation and modulates electronic coupling with adsorbates, directly contributing to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS in PHE.








Abstract
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance over transition metal catalysts is limited by the unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics, which involves the transformation of electronic spin states. In this work, we successfully regulate the spin state of Fe single atoms (SAs) from a low&#8208;spin configuration (LS) to a medium&#8208;spin state (MS) via a biomineralization strategy, where the coordination configuration of Fe SAs transforms from Fe&#8208;N4 to Fe&#8208;N3S. This spin state transition of Fe center is able to not only influence the orbital orientation but also modulate the electronic coupling between active sites and the adsorbates, thereby enhancing the kinetic process of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the spin polarization induced by this unique structure could also improve the utilization efficiency of the carriers by facilitating the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers and prolonging their lifetime. All these factors directly contribute to the superior activity of Fer&#8208;N&#8208;C@ZIS (Fer, ferritin; ZIS, ZnIn2S4), which delivers an impressive H2 evolution rate of approximately 31&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a high stability over 25 h of continuous operation.

         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reaction was realized by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid catalysis for the straightforward construction of enantioenriched diversely functionalized allylic compounds from organic feedstocks of aldehydes, allylboronates, and nucleophiles. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. Finally, the protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) reactions, named as the Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction, stand as a landmark in modern organic synthesis. The merge of AAS reactions with the concept of multicomponent modular synthesis could allow flexible customization of molecular architectures from fundamental feedstocks, which remains underdeveloped. Herein, we disclose our recent observations on a novel three&#8208;component asymmetric Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction enabled by cooperative palladium/Lewis acid (LA) catalysis. This &#8216;1C&#160;+&#160;2C&#160;+&#160;NuH&#8217; approach starts from fundamental organic feedstocks, i.e., aldehyde, allylboronate, and a nucleophile with the in situ formation of a C&#9552;C double bond. Diverse nucleophiles have been demonstrated to be applicable in this three&#8208;component AAS reaction, including malonates, acetylacetone, acetoacetate, phosphine oxides, sulfonyl hydrazides etc. The protocol successfully offers a novel platform to integrate two distinct bioactive molecular scaffolds to access diverse array of hybrids. Mechanistic studies suggest that the three&#8208;component AAS approach proceeds via a reaction sequence of LA&#8208;catalyzed allylation of aldehyde, olefin shift under palladium catalysis, and Pd/LA&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution.

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;Irradiated Polarized Emission in Mn(II) Bromide Hybrids with Chain&#8208;Like Alignment of Halopyridine and Polar MnBr42&#8722; Units</title>

[3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4] exhibits quasi&#8208;1D chain structure with antiparallel electric dipole alignment, and the corresponding X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Mn(II) halide hybrid crystals possess exceptional emission properties and pronounced anisotropic optoelectronic characteristics, making them highly promising for diverse applications. In this study, we present five structurally distinct Mn(II) hybrids, which either form the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains or a hybrid structure combining both 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains and a quasi&#8208;1D chains. These quasi&#8208;1D chains are composed of polar MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra and halogen&#8208;substituted pyridine ligands. Of particular interest is the mixed&#8208;polyhedral compound [3&#8208;IPy]3[MnBr3][MnBr4]. It exhibits dominant antiparallel alignment of dipole moment between quasi&#8208;1D chains, while 1D [(MnBr3)&#8722;]&#8734; chains display zero dipole moment. The highly&#8208;distorted MnBr42&#8722; tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, it gives rise to a pronounced and fascinating polarization&#8208;sensitive emission. These findings underscore the promising potential of mixed&#8208;polyhedral Mn(II) halide hybrids in polarized photonic applications and provide valuable insights for the rational design of polarization&#8208;sensitive functional materials.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra owing to strong hydrogen bonding with halopyridine introduces large inherent structural anisotropy. Under X-ray excitation, it gives rise to a pronounced and fascinating polarization-sensitive emission. These findings underscore the promising potential of mixed-polyhedral Mn(II) halide hybrids in polarized photonic applications and provide valuable insights for the rational design of polarization-sensitive functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Macrocycles: Photoswitching, Amplified Chirality, and Photo&#8208;Tailored Chiroptics</title>

&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral macrocycles with reversible photoregulatable chiroptics (|gabs|: 0.023&#8596;0.014; CPL ON/OFF) and cave sizes (e.g., 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8&#160;&#197; &#8596; 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;) were firstly synthesized, which do not exist in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Continuous chirality amplification was realized, giving high dissymmetry factors (|gabs| = 0.023, |glum| = 0.013). A size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively.








Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have attracted considerable attention because of their fascinating circular chiral topologies, circularly distributed electronic structures, and excellent chiroptical features. However, the challenging synthesis and limited cases hinder the understanding, improvement, and regulation of their optoelectronic properties. To avoid this dilemma, we employed cyclic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between dithienylethene (DTE) and [6]helicene to firstly synthesize donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles, including m&#8208;[1&#160;+&#160;1], m&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2], and m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3], where these compounds displayed photocontrollable ring sizes and chiroptical properties. More importantly, continuous amplification in chirality can be achieved via distinctive multiple chiral&#8208;centers&#8208;bonding in series within helical rings, giving high |gabs| and |glum| of up to 0.023 and 0.013, respectively. The macrocycles were endowed with a photoswitchable function that is absent in previously documented &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles. Both the cavity sizes and chiroptical properties could be photoregulated. As typical examples, the cavity dimension of m&#8208;[3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;PPP was photoadjusted from 25.8&#160;&#215;&#160;19.8 to 22.6&#160;&#215;&#160;18.3&#160;&#197;, accompanied by reversible photoswitched |gabs| between 0.023 and 0.014 and remarkable CPL ON/OFF behavior. Moreover, a size&#8208;photoswitching correlation was revealed innovatively, i.e., the photoswitching ability increased with increasing ring size. Our study provides a new guidance for developing high&#8208;performance chiral systems and novel stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral macrocycles and provides ideal platforms for understanding chiral structure&#8211;functionality relationships.

         <title>Convenient Production of Photothermal Recycling Phosphorescent Materials from Cellulose and Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of RTP films (Cell&#8208;Lig) from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin was achieved within 1 s through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition. Specifically, Cell&#8208;Lig can be readily recycled through light&#8208;controlled phase transitions, and the initial RTP performance was maintained over six cycles of recycling.








Abstract
Developing recyclable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) films using ultrafast fabrication techniques remains a critical yet challenging objective. With this research, we developed an RTP film (Cell&#8208;Lig) through ethanol&#8208;induced phase transition, achieving solid film formation within 1 s from ionic liquid (1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solutions of cellulose and lignin. The phase transition also generated a confined rigid environment for Cell&#8208;Lig, activating thickness&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent green RTP emission from the incorporated lignin. Furthermore, red afterglow emission using an energy transfer mechanism was realized by incorporating rhodamine B (RhB). The inherent photothermal activity of lignin endowed Cell&#8208;Lig with easy recyclability using light&#8208;controlled phase transitions. Under irradiation, photothermal evaporation of residual ethanol triggered liquefaction (solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition), while ethanol reintroduction facilitated instantaneous hardening. Remarkably, the initial RTP performance was maintained over six recycling cycles. Capitalizing on these attributes, Cell&#8208;Lig was successfully used for advanced coating and security applications.

         <title>Low Symmetry Cage Complexes Formed by Metalation of Symmetric Hexa&#8208;Cationic Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threefold symmetric hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation. When the cage contains ethyl solubilising groups the expected threefold symmetric cage complexes are observed, however when the cage contains alkoxy solubilising groups persistent low symmetry cage complexes form.








Abstract
Most metal organic cages are assembled through metal&#8211;ligand coordination, resulting in cages where the metal ions are part of the cage architecture, and thus have limited reactivity. There are only a handful of metal organic cages produced by metalation of a pre&#8208;synthesised organic cage. In this work, we show that hexa&#8208;cationic hydrazone cages coordinate a range of transition metal ions upon deprotonation to give cage complexes with metal ions oriented towards the cage cavity. Remarkably, a cage with ethyl solubilising groups gives the expected three&#8208;fold symmetric metallocage, cages with alkoxy solubilising groups give low&#8208;symmetry zinc metallocages, and a cage without a solubilising group switches between high and low symmetry conformations depending on solvent. These low symmetry arrangements persist on the NMR timescale at temperatures as high as 360&#160;K and in the presence of a wide range of anions.

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Triplet Excitons Tune Lanthanide Emission Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Eu3+&#8208;(or Tb3+&#8208;)&#8208;incorporated Lu3+ molecular crystals were prepared for the demonstration of the emission lifetime tuning method using slow triplet exciton migration. The lanthanide emission lifetimes were drastically extended (&#964;max = 152&#160;ms) by controlling the molar ratios of Eu3+ (or Tb3+) and modifying the ligand structures.








Abstract
Optical codes generated from the emission lifetimes of lanthanide complexes have received considerable attention for their potential application in multiplexed bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, such tunable lifetimes are limited to short ranges (0.01&#8722;1&#160;ms). Herein, we describe a method that extends the emission lifetime using dynamic molecular triplet excitons in aggregation systems composed of lanthanide complexes. To demonstrate the conceptual method, molecular crystals comprising lutetium (Lu3+) and luminescent lanthanide (europium: Eu3+ or terbium: Tb3+) complexes with two organic ligands (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionate and 2,7&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)phenanthrene) were prepared. These molecular crystals exhibited persistent emission via slow triplet exciton migration between the phenanthrene units. The extended degree of the lifetime could be controlled between 1 and 152&#160;ms by ligand modifications. This proposed lifetime&#8208;tuning method should significantly expand the encoding capacity of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Optical Force Monitoring in Polymeric Materials with a Coumarin&#8208;Based Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin dyes are reacted with acrylates to form a mechanophore via an accessible two&#8208;step synthesis that exhibits exclusive responsivity to force. Mechanical deformation of polymeric materials functionalized with the mechanophore activates blue fluorescence visible to the naked eye, enabling the optical detection of force&#8208;induced molecular damage in the material.








Abstract
Optical mechanophores offer a powerful platform for the real&#8208;time, nondestructive detection of mechanically induced damage in polymers. However, the exploitation of mechanophores for fundamental investigations of deformation processes and the prediction of failure in technologically critical applications has been constrained by their responsivity to other stimuli, laborious synthesis, and limited control of their photophysical and mechanical properties. Here, we report a cyclobutane&#8208;based mechanophore that activates a fluorescent coumarin dye through the application of mechanical stress in solution and in the solid state. We demonstrate the preparation of the mechanophore in two synthetic steps, its incorporation into linear and crosslinked polymers, and its thermal and photochemical stability, establishing the basis for a new class of mechanophores with tunable spectral and mechanical characteristics.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Box[6]arenes for 3D Charge&#8208;Transfer Co&#8208;Crystal Engineering via Macrocyclic Self&#8208;Complementary and Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Box[6]arene (B[6]A), a new kind of macrocyclic arene with flexible skeleton and bright fluorescence, has been designed and synthesized. Through the macrocyclic self&#8208;complementarity and &#8220;exo&#8208;wall&#8221; CT interactions, three 3D supramolecular assemblies are formed with the electron&#8208;deficient planar molecules TCNB, TFTN, and TClTN, showing tunable fluorescence and selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers.








Abstract
The construction of well&#8208;defined 3D charge&#8208;transfer (CT) co&#8208;crystals using new macrocyclic hosts to enable programmable functionality remains challenging due to the dimensional constraints imposed by conventional assembly strategies. Herein, we address this limitation using a new synthetic macrocycle named box[6]arene (B[6]A) with a flexible skeleton, which adopts two distinct conformations (B[6]A&#945; and B[6]A&#946;). Crucially, the self&#8208;complementary and exo&#8208;wall CT co&#8208;assembly of B[6]A facilitates the construction of 3D macrocycle&#8208;based co&#8208;crystals (MCCs) with planar electron&#8208;deficient guests, including 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFTN), and tetrachloroterephthalonitrile (TClTN). These MCCs exhibit tunable fluorescence with emission maxima at 690, 594, and 592&#160;nm, respectively. Notably, activated B[6]A&#8208;TCNB demonstrates selective vapochromic behaviors toward picoline isomers via a dual response mechanism. This study provides new insights into the design of functional macrocyclic arenes and 3D MCCs, paving the way for the development of color&#8208;tunable crystalline luminescent materials and advanced vapochromic systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Homogeneous Heterobimetallic&#8208;Oxide Interfaces Enable Synergistic Hydrogen Evolution Passivation for Durable Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulation strategy enables self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on Zn anodes. The design ingeniously blends the hydrolysis of SnCl4 and the replacement reaction of In3+ and Cu2+ ions with Zn metal to spontaneously generate the heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and the oxide SnO2. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance and the abundant nucleation sites in acidic media. 








Abstract
Acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries hold promising prospects in large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their higher discharge voltage and capacity. However, the challenge of developing long&#8208;term acidic Zn&#8211;Mn batteries still remains due to Zn anode instability in acidic media arising from the inevitable proton corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report self&#8208;assembled homogeneous heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces on the Zn anode surface via a multi&#8208;cation (Cu2+, In3+, and Sn4+) synergistic regulation strategy to achieve &gt;85.5% depth of discharge with over 1000&#160;h of cycling in strongly acidic medium (pH&#160;=&#160;0.9). The design ingeniously blends the SnCl4 hydrolysis and In3+ and Cu2+ ions replacement with Zn metal to spontaneously generate heterobimetallic In&#8211;CuZn5 and SnO2 oxide. Heterobimetallic&#8208;oxide interfaces could synergistically inhibit proton corrosion and HER while inducing Zn&#8208;ordered plating/stripping benefiting from the excellent acid resistance of SnO2 and the abundant nucleation sites of heterobimetallic. Crucially, the in situ hydrolysis of SnCl4 establishes a self&#8208;regulated acidic environment without additional acidic medium. Consequently, Zn&#8211;Mn pouch battery within this acidic environment delivers a high capacity of 1.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 and retains 84.9% of initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This direct multi&#8208;cation synergistic modulated self&#8208;assembly interface strategy holds significant potential for expediting the advancement of high&#8208;safety, large&#8208;scale energy storage technology.

         <title>Highly Flexible Porous Aromatic Frameworks with Exceptional Adsorption Capacity Toward Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a synthetic strategy for flexible porous aromatic frameworks (FPAFs). By Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x = 0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamic volatile organic compound (VOC) vapor adsorption studies showed that FPAFs achieved unprecedented VOC adsorption efficiency, establishing flexibility engineering as a principle for the design of next&#8208;generation adsorbents.








Abstract
In this work we report a novel strategy to enhance the adsorption capacity of conventional porous materials by engineering intrinsic framework flexibility into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). Through Yamamoto&#8208;type copolymerization of a rigid tetrahedral monomer (tetrakis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methane) and a flexible counterpart (tetrakis[(4&#8208;bromophenoxy)methyl]methane), we synthesized a series of flexible PAFs (FPAF&#8208;x, x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;2) with tunable flexibility. FPAF&#8208;0.5 with moderate flexibility and surface area (854&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) achieves exceptionally high volatile organic compound (VOC) adsorption capacities for various VOCs (e.g., 410.7&#160;wt% for THF and 339.4&#160;wt% for 3&#8208;methylthiophene), outperforming many other porous materials reported to date. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamics VOC vapor adsorption studies reveal that optimal flexibility enables guest&#8208;adaptive structural transformation, allowing pore expansion to accommodate additional VOC molecules after initial pore filling. Moreover, polar and aromatic VOCs induce greater framework expansion than nonpolar analogues, which can also enhance the VOC uptake capacity in FPAFs. This work establishes flexibility engineering as a design principle for next&#8208;generation adsorbents, improving the efficiency of VOC adsorption.

         <title>Balancing Solvation Ability of Polymer and Solvent in Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Efficient Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tailing the solvation ability of both polymer and solvent, this work establishes a correlation between Li+ coordination, ion transport, and interphase formation in gel electrolytes. A combination of weakly coordinated polymer and lower donor number (DN) solvent enables the gel electrolyte to achieve fast ion hopping and form a robust interphase for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) show practical potential in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but their development is hindered by insufficient understanding of Li+ solvation chemistry and its impact on ion transport and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. By regulating the solvation abilities of polymer and solvent, this work explores the relationships between GPE composition, Li+ coordination structures, Li+ transference number, and interphase chemistry. The GPE combining weakly coordinated solvents with strongly coordinating polymer results in strong Li+&#8208;polymer attachment, leading to sluggish ion transport. Employing strongly chelating solvents causes complete Li+&#8208;polymer detachment, forming micelle structures that obstruct ion transport. The GPE with both weakly coordinated solvent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#160;and polymer 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;tridecafluoro&#8208;n&#8208;octyl acrylate (TFOA) enables optimal interactions between Li+ and polymer/solvent, facilitating partial Li+&#8208;polymer detachment and aggregates (AGGs) generation, avoiding micelle formation. This promotes efficient Li+ transport and anion&#8208;derived SEI generation. The resulting GPE achieves 99.2% Coulombic efficiency (CE) in Cu||Li cells and enables 4.5&#160;V LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||Li to demonstrate 81% capacity retention after 140 cycles. These findings provide valuable insights for further advanced GPE design.

         <title>Regioselective Separation and Extraction of Polyalkylthiophene by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

We report a novel MOF&#8208;based method for extracting high&#8208;regioregularity poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures. Nanopore threading&#8208;based adsorption enables recognition of erroneous head&#8211;head linkages, allowing precise isolation of regioregular P3HT. Both chromatography and batch processes demonstrate regioregularity&#8208;dependent sorting, introducing a new paradigm in polymer purification.








Abstract
Here, we report a novel method for selectively extracting high&#8208;regioregularity (RR) poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from crude mixtures using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as nanoporous separation media. This approach leverages a kinetically driven &#8220;threading&#8221; mechanism in one&#8208;dimensional MOF channels, which discriminate subtle differences in the bonding patterns, e.g., head&#8208;head and head&#8208;tail linkages, in the main chain. By employing both MOF column chromatography and batch&#8208;scale separation techniques, higher RR fractions of P3HT were readily extracted from a crude mixture containing lower RR fractions.

         <title>Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation Strategy Enables Rapid Discovery of Potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 Interaction Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a novel protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors design strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. Known high&#8208;affinity binders serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221;. As a proof of concept, the potent PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 was discovered for inhibiting the interaction of CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2.








Abstract
Traditional strategies for developing small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) are time&#8208;consuming and often yield low success rates due to the flat and dynamic interfaces of PPIs. To enable the rapid design of highly potent PPI inhibitors, we proposed a novel strategy named &#8220;Fulcrum Occupancy&#8211;Leverage Perturbation (FOLP)&#8221;. In this strategy, high&#8208;affinity fragments serve as the &#8220;Fulcrum&#8221; by binding to the orthosteric pocket, while suitable moieties extend into allosteric sites near the PPI interface as &#8220;Leverage&#8221; to modulate the protein&#8211;protein interaction. As a proof of concept, the potent CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 PPI inhibitor LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3, which fits the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; paradigm, was discovered with an IC50 of 32.1&#160;nM for inhibiting the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and cryptic pocket identification were employed, revealing the activation loop (A&#8208;loop) of CDK2 was flexible and targetable. X&#8208;ray crystallography and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX&#8208;MS) analysis showed that LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 indeed bound to and stabilized the A&#8208;loop. LC&#8208;K2CAin&#8208;3 effectively inhibited the CDK2&#8211;Cyclin A2 interaction in CDK2 highly expressed melanoma cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibition of CDK2 mediated signaling. In conclusion, the &#8220;FOLP&#8221; strategy offers a novel approach for PPI inhibitor discovery and could accelerate the development of PPI inhibitors.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanohydrogel&#8208;Based Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Nanozyme for Photocatalytic Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) was prepared by in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on Zn&#8208;porphyrin COF. Compared to bulk COF, it exhibits enhanced oxidase&#8208;like activity and 1O2 generation under visible light irradiation, synergistically boosting bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) via homogeneous catalysis and PNIPAM&#8208;mediated bacterial adhesion, which further accelerates wound disinfection and healing.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble nanozymes have the potential to overcome the limitations of low catalytic efficiency of most heterogeneous nanozymes in aqueous solutions and further expand their applications in the biomedical field, but with significant synthetic challenges. Here we report an oxidase&#8208;mimicking water&#8208;soluble nanozyme based on zinc porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework nanohydrogel (Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG) for photocatalytic antibacterial. The in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on scaffold of Zn&#8208;COF results in the exfoliation of crystalline COF nanosheets and assembly into nanohydrogels in aqueous solution. The obtained Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG can effectively mimic photoresponsive oxidase&#8208;like activity for the chromogenic catalysis of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by facilitating homogeneous behavior to enhance catalytic efficiency, while also exhibiting intelligent temperature&#8208;response regulation of catalytic oxidation activity. Moreover, the high photodynamic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reinforcement of binding to the exterior of bacteria through noncovalent interactions concurrently boost its bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) by amplifying oxidative stress. In vivo study on S. aureus&#8208;infected murine model further substantiates the superior wound disinfection and healing effect of Zn&#8208;COF&#8208;NHG. Our work paves a way for the utilization of COF nanohydrogel as a potent antibacterial nanozyme agent and provides a novel platform for the development of biomedical applications.

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Center&#8208;Containing 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes via Cyanocarbene Addition to Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Described is a rare example of single&#8208;carbon insertion into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using diazo&#8208;free donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) carbenes, which are generated in situ through reactions of ethynyl hypervalent iodine reagents with azides. This method is used for the synthesis of bridge&#8208;functionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs), including BCP&#8208;Sonidegib, which exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib.








Abstract
While 1,3&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have garnered considerable interest in medicinal chemistry as bioisosteres of para&#8208;substituted benzenes, the utilization of bridge&#8208;functionalized BCPs, especially those containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers at the bridge&#8208;positions, in drug design has lagged behind. This is primarily due to the synthetic challenges associated with these scaffolds. Herein, we report the insertion of diazo&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor carbenes into the C&#9472;C bond of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs), enabling the rapid and modular synthesis of 1,2,2,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) bearing three all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers in up to 83% yield. This transformation is metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, operationally simple, and accomodates to a wide range of substrates. The decoration of bioactive molecules with 2,2&#8208;disubstituted BCP exhibits superior antitumor activity compared to the anticancer drug Sonidegib, rendering this method highly practical and appealing. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with control experiments reveal that the reaction proceeds through a stepwise nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening/recyclization pathway, involving the reaction between the singlet carbene species and the BCB skeleton.

         <title>A Photon&#8208;Driven Unimolecular Immunostimulant for Self&#8208;Amplified Pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway by Destroying the Pyroptosis Checkpoint</title>

The proposed Bio&#8208;Cy conjugate emerges as an avant&#8208;garde molecular entity, adeptly activating the pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to heighten the cytocidal impact of photon&#8208;driven immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking approach for clinically treating tumors, but its effectiveness is hindered by the tumor's immunosuppressive environment and lack of immune cell infiltration, enabling tumors to evade the immune system. Although the activation of both innate and adaptive immunities is a promising strategy to counteract this bottleneck, their synergy remains challenging. Therefore, we developed Bio&#8208;Cy, an unprecedented organic unimolecular photosensitive immunostimulant, which stimulates self&#8208;amplifying pyroptosis and cGAS&#8208;STING pathways by disrupting pyroptosis checkpoints to enhance adaptive and innate immunity activation. Mechanistic studies have shown that Bio&#8208;Cy can target cancer cells and be transported to lysosomes via endocytosis, generating reactive oxygen species through a Type I photodynamic mechanism to destroy cancer cells, even under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, this lysosomal disruption not only activates the caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;dependent pyroptosis of adaptive immunity through mitochondrial damage by releasing Ca2+, but also enhances the cGAS&#8208;STING innate immune pathway by releasing mitochondrial DNA. More importantly, the initial lysosomal damage impairs protective cellular autophagy, destroying the pyroptosis checkpoint and thus preventing the clearance of damaged mitochondria and amplifying immune responses, ultimately boosting immunotherapy. This strategy effectively treats primary tumors and inhibits metastatic growth, offering a new paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Umpolung Activation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed umpolung of bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) aldehydes enables nucleophilic cycloaddition with carbonyls and imines to form bicyclic lactones and lactams. The resulting oxa&#8208; and aza&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane products can be further transformed into valuable rigid 3D scaffolds, offering a simple and versatile approach to access new chemical space with potential applications in medicinal chemistry. 








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has predominantly been explored as an electrophile or radical acceptor owing to its inherent polarity. However, its reactivity as a nucleophile remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report an umpolung strategy that reverses the innate polarity of bicyclobutane aldehydes via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This transformation enables the construction of novel rigidified lactones and lactams via coupling with diverse electrophilic partners, including aldehydes, ketones, and imines. The synthetic versatility of this method highlights its potential for applications in medicinal chemistry by providing new building blocks with defined exit vectors.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanocrystals with Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;IIb Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) via controllable cation intermixing (Ca2+, Ln3+), the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) between the host lattice and the lanthanide emitters can be regulated. This enables tunable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) lifetime, which is beneficial for time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.








Abstract
Lattice engineering in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) is fundamental for tailoring their versatile optical properties, yet it remains underexplored in manipulating the downconversion characteristics. Here, we engineer the lattices from distorted to strain&#8208;graded in LnNCs by CaF2 deposition on vacancy&#8208;controlled &#946;&#8208;NaxGdF3+x:Yb,A (A = Tm/Er, x = 0.5, 0.75, 1) NCs. We demonstrate that strain&#8208;graded lattices with high phonon energy enhance the multi&#8208;phonon orbit&#8208;lattice relaxation (MPR) in the downconversion process more effectively than distorted lattices, which helps to extend the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb, 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm) lifetime of Er3+/Tm3+ by 2&#8764;4 times. Subsequent epitaxial CaF2 growth further attenuates surface phonon coupling, enabling exponential tunability of NIR&#8208;IIb lifetime (Tm3+: 0.74&#8764;6.28&#160;ms; Er3+: 0.055&#8764;9.2&#160;ms). Finally, we showcase the potential of these LnNCs in time&#8208;resolved multiplexed bioimaging.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis from Plastic Waste and Ammonia via C&#9472;N Bond Construction Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative photocatalytic strategy was reported for sustainable formamide (FA) synthesis via C&#9472;N bond construction from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste. Specifically, Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst achieves a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 alongside concurrent H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that single&#8208;atom Pt and Au nanoparticles synergize charge separation, facilitating radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic redox efficiency. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into value&#8208;added chemicals represents a sustainable route for plastic valorization. However, previous studies have solely focused on generating oxygenated compounds through intramolecular C&#9472;O bond transformations. Achieving heteroatom&#8208;containing important chemicals via intermolecular coupling reactions is still challenging. Herein, we report the first example of the direct photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) with ammonia to produce formamide (FA) and H2 over a Pt1Au/TiO2 catalyst. Pt1Au/TiO2 delivers a FA yield rate of &#8764;7.1&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, as well as H2 evolution (&#8764;22.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Photoelectrochemical analyses, including time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reveal that monatomic Pt sites can effectively trap electrons, while Au nanoparticles act as hole sinks, thereby synergistically enhancing charge separation efficiency. Mechanistic investigations via in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) elucidate the reaction pathway: EG undergoes hole&#8208;mediated oxidation to yield an aldehyde intermediate, which is subsequently attacked nucleophilically by hole&#8208;derived &#8226;NH2, inducing sequential C&#9472;C bond cleavage and C&#9472;N bond formation. This work provides critical mechanistic insights for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value heteroatom&#8208;containing chemicals from plastic waste.

         <title>Accessing Metal&#8208;Containing Species in Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Precursor Solutions via Molecular Strategies Guided by the Hard&#8211;Soft Acid&#8211;Base Principle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strategies guided by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base (HSAB) principle enable precise control over metal&#8208;based species in perovskite precursor solutions. This approach enhances the quality of narrow&#8208;bandgap (1.26&#160;eV) mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite films and improves the performance of the resulting solar cell devices.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;centred species in metal halide perovskite precursor solutions substantially influence the formation and evolution of colloidal particles, which in turn dictate the crystallisation process and the film quality. In this work, we assess the &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221; Lewis acid characteristics of Sn2+ and Pb2+ cations as a strategy to modulate the chemical environment of these metal&#8208;containing species in mixed&#8208;metal tin&#8211;lead perovskite precursor solutions. We observe enhanced simultaneous access to both metal centres upon adding compounds with functional groups suggested by the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle. Theoretical calculations suggest that the hard base carboxyl group preferentially interacts with Sn2+&#8208;based species, while the softer base thiol group also targets Pb2+&#8208;based species. By effectively accessing and manipulating possible classes of inorganic species and their colloidal particle properties in the precursor solutions, we achieve 1.26 eV perovskite polycrystalline films exhibiting enhanced structural and optoelectronic quality, giving the best quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting values of up to 0.95&#160;eV. As a result, the solar cell devices demonstrate efficiency values of up to 23.3% with an extended operational lifetime, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after over 280 and 180&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 25 and 65 &#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Spin Frustration Determines the Stability and Reactivity of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Triangular Iron(III)&#8211;Oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standard DFT fails to capture the spin&#8208;frustrated ground state of triangular Fe(III) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to distorted geometries and incorrect binding predictions. Using flip&#8208;spin DFT, we identify the true ground state of MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and show how magnetic frustration governs temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding, underscoring the need to treat spin effects accurately.








Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) is the standard approach for modeling MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and related Fe&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks, typically assuming a ferromagnetic high&#8208;spin configuration. However, this widely adopted approach overlooks a key electronic feature: Spin frustration in the triangular Fe3(&#956;3${\rm Fe}_{3}(\mu _{3}$&#8208;O) nodes. Using flip&#8208;spin, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT, we identify the true ground state as an antiferromagnetic 2S+1=6$2S+1=6$ state that standard DFT fails to capture. We demonstrate that neglecting spin frustration in MIL&#8208;101(Fe) leads to structural distortions, incorrect energetics, and misleading predictions of stability and reactivity. By explicitly accounting for spin frustration, we recover the correct structure and rationalize the temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding. Spin frustration enhances N2${\rm N}_{2}$ fixation at room temperature, while its loss upon partial FeIII${\rm Fe}^{\mathrm {III}}$ reduction suppresses this activity but promotes CO adsorption via &#960;$\pi$&#8208;backbonding. These findings challenge current computational conventions and highlight spin frustration as a critical electronic feature in these&#160;frameworks.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Nanoribbons with up to 29 Linearly&#8208;Fused Rings and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three triptycene end&#8208;capped N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons with precise length are prepared through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits. The longest one comprises a 29&#8208;linearly&#8208;fused&#8208;ring backbone, setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the reported soluble nonalternant nanoribbons. Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy measurements indicate high intrinsic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities in these nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, one of the highest values reported for graphene nanoribbons and the highest observed to date for non&#8208;alternant ones.








Abstract
The synthesis of nonalternant graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)&#8212;carbon&#8208;based nanostructures featuring fused pentagonal or heptagonal rings that disrupt hexagonal symmetry&#8212;has remained a significant challenge despite their unique electronic properties, such as tunable bandgaps and topological states. Unlike conventional alternant hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene&#8208;derived systems), nonalternant architectures exhibit distinct electron confinement effects, making them promising for nanoscale optoelectronics and quantum materials. However, achieving precise control over their length, solubility, and structural regularity has had limited progress. Herein, we report a versatile solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a novel family of structurally precise N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons (NRs: NR&#8208;11 to NR&#8208;29) through pentagon annulation of pyrazino[2,3&#8208;g]quinoxaline and naphthalene subunits terminated with triptycene end&#8208;caps. The longest one comprises 29 linearly fused rings (particularly including 10 pentagonal rings), setting a new length record of 7.18&#160;nm among the soluble nonalternant NRs reported to date. Strategic incorporation of triptycene end&#8208;caps and alkoxyphenyl substituents into their molecular backbones confers high solubility and a unique 3D configuration, enabling comprehensive solution&#8208;phase structural characterization and systematic investigation of length&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.

Employing terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we infer high intrinsic charge carrier mobilities in nonalternant nanoribbons, reaching up to &#8764;2000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, highlighting this novel family of nanoribbons as promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Triangular Pore in Single&#8208;Layer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Membrane for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012 pores&#160;per&#160;cm2) are reported. They demonstrate ultrahigh H2 permeance and CO2 permeance as well as good H2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivities, providing a new membrane platform for achieving efficient molecular sieving and understanding nanopore transport. 








Abstract
Single&#8208;layer crystalline films are ideal separation membrane materials because their atomic thickness could yield the highest possible molecular flux once nanopores are generated. However, the development of single&#8208;layer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore structures remains elusive, which makes the realization of efficient molecular sieving and interpretation of molecular transport a difficult task. Herein, we report the fabrication of single&#8208;layer nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes that uniquely contain triangular nanopores with a high density (around 1012&#160;pores&#160;per&#160;cm2). The hBN membranes exhibit a H2 permeance of 5.43&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1 with a H2/CH4 selectivity of 14.7; they also show a CO2 permeance of 1.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1&#160;Pa&#8722;1, with a CO2/N2 selectivity of 12.3. Importantly, we show that straightforward mathematical modeling can predict and describe the gas transport properties of the hBN, providing new insights into the molecular transport across atomically thin nanopores. The results gained from this study could significantly advance our understanding of molecular transport across hBN nanopores and may promote the development of hBN membranes to address critical separation issues.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] Cycloadditions of Furan Ortho&#8208;Quinodimethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes is presented. The reaction proceeds in good yields and with high enantioselectivities allowing for the formation of novel classes of cyclooctanoids. DFT calculations point to an intriguing mechanism, where the stereochemical outcome is attributed to protonation of the catalyst&#8208;bound intermediate in the stereo&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
The enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition for the construction of cyclooctanoids is a challenging transformation in organic chemistry. Herein, we present the first organocatalytic enantioselective [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition of furan ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes, activated by dearomatization of the heteroaromatic compound, which thereby allows for the cycloaddition with dienes. The [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition is catalyzed by a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine in combination with a chiral phosphoric acid and a carboxylic acid affording cyclooctanoids isolated as a single diastereoisomer in good yields and with up to 94% ee. This reaction concept allows for the formation of cyclooctanoids without benzofusion, as demonstrated by oxidative opening of the furan ring. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism for the [4&#160;+&#160;4] cycloaddition point to a stepwise process. Surprisingly, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is attributed to protonation of the two organocatalyst&#8208;bound cyclooctanoid intermediates leading to a preferred set&#8208;up for catalyst elimination to account for the absolute configuration of the cyclooctanoid.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Conjugated Alkylfluorene Bridged Naphthalimides Cathode Interlayer Enables Low&#8208;Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work delivers a universal design strategy of a novel nonfused conjugated small molecule, namely FNA, serving as CILs to realize highly sensitive NIR photodetectors. The FNA&#8208;based OPDs exhibit enhanced interfacial contact and augmented photoresponse, achieving a notably low dark current and high specific detectivity, outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as the CIL. This innovative approach offers profound insights into the development of high&#8208;performance photodetectors.








Abstract
The cathode interface layers (CILs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of organic photodiodes (OPDs). However, the poor film formation, the tendency of orientation and aggregation, and contact in the interface of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/CILs/electrode increase the dark current, leading to a limitation of light detection. In this study, we designed and synthesized a nonfused conjugated small molecule (FNA) with dioctyl fluorene (F) as the &#960;&#8208;bridge and N&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NA) as terminal groups. As the CIL, it significantly modifies the interfaces of BHJ/CILs/electrode and minimizes dark current density (Jd). Using PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F as the BHJ, FNA&#8208;based OPDs achieve a remarkably low Jd of 1.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8&#160;A cm&#8722;2 (at &#8722;0.5&#160;V) and a peak specific detectivity of 8.23&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones (940&#160;nm), outperforming conventional devices with PDINN as CIL. These improvements are attributed to lower Jd by modified interfacial contact and increased photoresponse by reducing depletion region width in FNA&#8208;based photodiodes. Furthermore, uniform photoresponse in 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 OPD pixel arrays further validates its potential for imaging applications.

         <title>Thermodynamic Feedback Mechanisms for Mitigating Polarization in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a thermodynamic negative feedback mechanism in lithium&#8208;ion battery polarization, demonstrating that regions with steep open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) slope can self&#8208;regulate reaction rate distribution, and proposes a design strategy to mitigate polarization heterogeneity by tailoring the OCV profile, offering a new principle for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is intrinsically determined by the interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, which jointly govern the polarization dynamics across multiple scales. Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions.

&lt;p&gt;This study unveils a thermodynamic negative feedback mechanism in lithium-ion battery polarization, demonstrating that regions with steep open-circuit voltage (OCV) slope can self-regulate reaction rate distribution, and proposes a design strategy to mitigate polarization heterogeneity by tailoring the OCV profile, offering a new principle for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is intrinsically determined by the interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic processes, which jointly govern the polarization dynamics across multiple scales. Extensive efforts have been directed toward alleviating kinetic limitations, but the essential role of thermodynamic factors, particularly under extreme operating conditions, has been largely overlooked. This oversight has impeded the development of comprehensive design principle for optimizing LIBs. In this study, we systematically investigate the coupled effects between thermodynamics and kinetics using advanced multiphysics simulations. We identify the slope of the equilibrium potential profile as a pivotal thermodynamic parameter. Steeper slopes have been demonstrated to induce stronger negative feedback, thereby effectively mitigating polarization heterogeneity and realizing the consistent electrode utilization. Based on this insight, we propose a design strategy centered on steepening the equilibrium potential to enhance thermodynamic feedback. This approach achieves a remarkable 80% reduction in polarization heterogeneity, significantly improving operational stability. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for polarization dynamics and offers actionable thermodynamic design principles, paves the way for the development of LIBs capable of extreme operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Electrolyte and Electrode Structures Enhance Ammonium Vanadate Mg&#8208;storage Performance for 100 mAh&#8208;Level Mg&#8208;ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a synergistic strategy involving simultaneous regulation of the electrolyte and electrode structure was proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs). The assembled multilayer aqueous Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell delivers the highest capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh among. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs. These findings provide a novel strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance AMIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous Mg&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) have attracted increasing interest due to their safety, fast kinetics, and sustainability. However, the development of AMIBs is hindered by the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of electrolytes and electrode degradation. Here, a synergistic strategy, regulating both electrolyte and electrode structures, is proposed to enable high&#8208;performance AMIBs. Incorporating a polyethylene glycol crowding agent into Mg(ClO4)2/H2O electrolyte regulates the solvation structure, which suppresses hydrogen evolution, and expands the ESW beyond 3.1&#160;V. Meanwhile, an ammonium vanadate (NHVO) material with enlarged interlayer spacing is synthesized, and a freestanding NHVO/graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (NHVO/GO/CNT) electrode is constructed to enhance Mg2+ diffusion and mitigate vanadium dissolution. Under the synergistic regulation, NHVO/GO/CNT exhibits a high capacity of 284.0 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and the longest cycling lifespan (16&#160;000 cycles with 95.6% capacity retention). The solvation structure of electrolytes and interfacial stabilization mechanisms are elucidated through theory calculations. The Mg&#8208;storage mechanism of NHVO based on a single&#8208;phase insertion/extraction reaction with NH4+/Mg2+ displacement phenomenon is revealed. The constructed multilayer Mg&#8208;ion pouch cell achieves a record&#8208;high capacity of 103.7&#160;mAh. The integrated solar cell&#8208;pouch cell device demonstrates the feasibility of photo&#8208;charging AMIBs for the first time. This work offers a viable strategy toward practical, high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Control in Copper(I) Iodides via Inorganic Structural Engineering Within a Single&#8208;Cation Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission tunability was achieved in hybrid copper(I) halides through systematic engineering of the inorganic framework within a single&#8208;cation host system. Mechanism investigation revealed the evolution of the self&#8208;trapping exciton emission mechanism, which is closely related to the inorganic Cu&#8211;I coordination configuration. This work provides insights into the rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.








Abstract
Hybrid copper(I) halides have emerged as a new class of optoelectronic materials due to their tunable structure and photophysical properties. However, systematically correlating inorganic polyhedra configurations with emission characteristics remains challenging. Herein, we address this by synthesizing a homologous series of copper(I) iodides templated solely by the [C13H24N]+ cation. Precise control reaction conditions yielded distinct inorganic polyhedral configurations, monomeric [CuI3]2&#8722; (1), dimeric [Cu2I4]2&#8722; (2), trimeric [Cu3I6]3&#8722; (3), and tetrameric [Cu4I6]2&#8722; (4). We establish a direct correlation where increasing inorganic aggregation systematically reduces the bandgap and dictates the luminescence color across a near&#8208;full visible spectrum, from blue (1) to cyan (2), red (3), and yellow (4). Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal the self&#8208;trapped excitons emission mechanism dependent on the Cu&#8208;I configuration, in which the closed [Cu4I6]2&#8722; configuration is more resistant to excited lattice deformation, thereby resulting in a lowest Stokes shift energy. Furthermore, stimuli&#8208;responsive sequential phase transitions between these well&#8208;defined structures were demonstrated, offering insights into their structural dynamics. This work provides critical fundamental understanding of how inorganic framework engineering within a fixed organic host precisely controls both electronic structure and excited&#8208;state relaxation pathways in hybrid copper(I) halides, paving the way for rational design of materials with tailored optical properties.

         <title>Node Flexibility Unlocks Structural Adaptability and Guest Versatility of Anionocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing node flexibility has proved an effective strategy to enhance the structural adaptability and guest versatility of anionocages. Unprecedented, nano&#8208;sized anionocages were obtained, enabling the binding of [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; with a significant increase in quantum yield (&#8764;5&#8208;fold) and lifetime (&#8764;2&#8208;fold), as well as the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence from racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; via host&#8211;guest chirality transfer.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional nodal flexibility, anionocages are promising host molecules capable of mimicking the dynamic self&#8208;assembly and host&#8211;guest chemistry of proteins. However, their application has been limited by the challenges in constructing large internal cavities. Here, we present an effective strategy to overcome this limitation by enhancing node flexibility to improve both structural adaptability and guest encapsulation versatility. Specifically, anion coordination between a C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;urea ligand (L) and an organophosphate, PhPO42&#8722; (A), generates highly flexible nodes that enable adaptive self&#8208;assembly and the encapsulation of guests of unprecedented size. Crystal structures revealed that the same ligand and anion can form three geometrically distinct anionocages (A4L4 tetrahedron 1, A6L6 trigonal antiprism 2, and A6L8 octahedron 3), with cavity sizes ranging from 0.208 to 1.320&#160;nm3. In solution, controlled interconversions among the three anionocages can be achieved by modulating the guest template, A/L ratio, and concentration. These nanoscale cavities successfully encapsulate the luminescent metal complex, [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; (bpy = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), resulting in a &#8764;5&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield, and a &#8764;2&#8208;fold increase in lifetime. Moreover, circularly polarized luminescence of racemic [Ru(bpy)3]2&#8314; is induced via chirality transfer using a chiral&#8208;anion&#8208;directed octahedral cage (4) as the host.

         <title>Volcano&#8208;Shaped Relationship Between Interfacial K+&#8208;H2O Ratio and CO2 Reduction Activity in Tandem Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The M4/Ni1NC catalysts featuring single Ni atoms and M4 atomic clusters can dynamically modulate *H supply and ECRR performance through regulating interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio. A volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio near the electrode and ECRR performance. Cu4/Ni1NC with a moderate interfacial K+&#8208;H2O ratio achieves a high FECO of &gt;95% across a 0.8&#160;V potential range, delivering industrially relevant current density of 385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. 








Abstract
Modulating surface&#8208;active hydrogen (*H) supply represents a critical strategy to boost the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR), yet the mechanistic interplay between *H dynamics and catalytic behavior remains ambiguous. Herein, we construct tandem catalysts (M4/Ni1NC, M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Cu, or Mn) by coupling tetranuclear metal clusters (M4) with single&#8208;atom Ni sites on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1NC) to regulate *H supply. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the *H supply is governed by both thermodynamics and kinetic factors. The M4 clusters provide the thermodynamic feasibility for *H supply for CO2 activation. The *H supply rate in kinetic perspective is tuned by the K+&#8208;H2O ratio of interfacial water, determined by work function of the decorated M4 clusters. The increased K+&#8208;H2O ratio can promote water dissociation to maintain optimal *H coverage for intermediate hydrogenation, whereas excessive *H accumulation triggers competitive hydrogen evolution. Therefore, a volcanic relationship was observed between the K+&#8208;H2O ratio and ECRR performance. Among these samples, Cu4/Ni1NC with moderate *H supply rate in kinetic exhibits exceptional ECRR performance, achieving &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency for CO across a 0.8&#160;V potential range (&#8722;0.2 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE) and industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&#8764;385&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#160;V) in a flow cell.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily accessible and cheap iron complex is capable of catalyzing highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannation reactions of terminal alkyl alkynes as well as the stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. The addition likely follows a &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism; the intervention of iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded.








Abstract
The readily accessible iron complex [Cp*FeCl(tmeda)] is an effective catalyst for the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective trans&#8208;hydrostannylation of terminal alkyl alkynes, affording a type of alkenylstannanes that is difficult to make otherwise. The R3Sn&#8208; moiety is faithfully delivered to the terminal C&#8208;atom, unless a propargylic or homo&#8208;propargylic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NH2 group is present in the substrate, which (partly or fully) inverts the regiochemical course; this steering effect, however, can be switched off upon protection of the protic site. The trans&#8208;addition likely starts by insertion of the [Cp*FeCl] fragment into the R3Sn&#9472;H bond, followed by a migratory insertion of the ligated alkyne into the Fe&#9472;Sn unit of the Fe(IV) species thus formed. This &#8220;modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8221; mechanism is manifested in a stannylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne derivatives, which has hardly any precedent either; a pathway via iron vinylidene intermediates can be excluded on the basis of deuterium labeling experiments.

         <title>Freely&#8208;Rotatable Multidentate Molecular Anchor Enables Self&#8208;Adaptive Aqueous Binders for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidentate molecular anchoring strategy was proposed to optimize the binders performance for lithium ion batteries. The BHB possesses a very special molecular rotation properties that can facilitate a multidentate anchoring effect to efficiently withstand the volume change of Si&#8208;based anodes after cross&#8208;linking with the traditional binders.








Abstract
The rational design and synthesis of reliable binders is a big challenge to efficiently mitigate the severe volume change of silicon&#8208;based anodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we report a multidentate molecular anchoring strategy to construct a novel self&#8208;adaptive aqueous binder. This binder composes of robust 3D dynamic networks derived from the crosslinking of the freely&#8208;rotatable multidentate molecular anchor (2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid, BHB) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) via dynamic hydrogen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly, which effectively imparts the fabrication of high&#8208;strength Si/C anodes and achieves high areal capacities (6.13&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2) under a high mass loading of 13&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the dynamic and reversible adhesion and the efficient &#8220;net&#8208;to&#8208;point&#8221; bonding characteristic contribute to enhance structural and interfacial stability in the NCM811/Si/C full cells. Consequently, the cells demonstrate superior cyclability and electrochemical performance. Notably, this multidentate molecular anchoring strategy can be further extended to develop other BHB&#8208;derived self&#8208;adaptive binders (i.e., BHB/PVA and BHB/CMC) for the purpose of dynamic structure regulation. This work provides valuable insights into the judicious modulation of aqueous binders from the perspective of molecular chemistry and product engineering, paving the pathway for the design of auqeous binders for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Stereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Topologically Chiral [6]Catenane with 18 Crossings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective construction of a record&#8208;complex 24&#8208;metal [6]catenane (1816$18_1^6$ link) with 18 crossings is achieved via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enables exclusive formation of topological enantiomers, each featuring four topologically chiral stereogenic units. Synergistic &#960;&#8208;stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects direct the formation of this six&#8208;ring entangled architecture. 








Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit unique properties and functions arising from their structural entanglement, features of which are absent in their individual components. However, synthesizing topologically complex architectures, particularly those with topological chirality, remains a significant challenge due to the lack of general methods for controlled entanglement. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of a 24&#8208;metal&#8208;center topologically chiral [6]catenane featuring 18 crossings (1816$18_1^6$ link), representing one of the most intricate MIMs constructed to date. This complex architecture was achieved in high yield (71%) via one&#8208;step coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of 12 chiral semirigid bidentate ligands and 12 conjugated binuclear half&#8208;sandwich organometallic clips. Critically, chirality transfer from enantiopure ligands enabled exclusive formation of topological enantiomer pairs (Rh&#8208;1S/Rh&#8208;1R), each containing four topologically chiral stereogenic units&#8212;three cyclic [3]catenane components and one closed three&#8208;link chain component. The self&#8208;assembly is synergistically directed by integrated noncovalent interactions (sevenfold &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and solvophobic effects), as unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This design strategy, incorporating tailored noncovalent interaction sites in building blocks, provides a viable approach for synthesizing other structurally complex topologically chiral MIMs.

         <title>Solvent Polarity Triggered Rapidly Reversible Quadruple&#8208;Mode Luminescence Adjustment in 0D Hybrid Antimony Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide demonstrates quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switching with a rapid response (&lt;1s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805;100 cycles) triggered with moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. The solvochromism mechanism links luminescence tuning to solvent polarity, with dipole moment changed from moderately&#8208;polar solvents, and phase transformation induced by strongly&#8208;polar solvents. This crystal shows potential for solvent detection, safety monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimension (0D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides are highly attractive as smart responsive luminescent materials, but the multiple&#8208;mode luminescence switch is rarely achieved and intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is unclear. Herein, we report a yellowish&#8208;green&#8208;emitting (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 (Me3BzN: trimethylbenzyl ammonium) single crystal, revealing quadruple/triple&#8208;mode luminescence switch with rapid response time (&lt;1&#160;s) and excellent recyclability (&#8805; 100 cycles) when triggered by moderately&#8208;polar and strongly&#8208;polar solvents. Significantly, the intrinsic solvochromism mechanism is systematically proposed, of which the reversibly multiple&#8208;mode luminescence tuning is closely related to solvent polarity, the moderate polarity can lead to luminescence redshift from 560 to 670&#160;nm due to the increase of dipole moment for inorganic polyhedron. Besides, the small molecular solvent with strong polarity can insert into crystal and form &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; system, inducing single crystal&#8208;single crystal phase transformation with structural disorder and Sb&#8208;Sb distance variation. Owing to the unique multiple&#8208;mode luminescence adjustment performance, (Me3BzN)3Sb2Cl9 displays potential candidate in solvent detection, safety monitoring and information encryption scenarios. These findings highlight the significance of solvent polarity and molecule volume on the dynamic luminescence adjustment and offer guidance for the development of new smart responsive 0D hybrid antimony halides in advanced optical switchable fields.

         <title>White Circularly Polarized OLEDs Enabled by Orthogonal Engineering of Achiral Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters and Chiral Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising strategy by orthogonal engineering of achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and chiral orange assemblies was proposed to fabricate white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This strategy leverages the high exciton utilization and chiral amplification, yielding a record gEL of 0.34 and EQEmax of 6.3%. This work represented the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art white CP&#8208;OLEDs, delivering the highest reported combination of external quantum efficiency (EQE) and gEL to date. 








Abstract
The development of white circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) faces a critical challenge in simultaneously achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and large dissymmetry factors (g), due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between exciton utilization and chirality amplification. Herein, we propose an orthogonal architecture synergizing an achiral blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter with chiral orange assemblies to overcome this limitation. The chiral assemblies, featuring exceptional chiroptical activity (|gabs| = 0.95 and |glum| = 0.85), are engineered as both photon&#8208;selective filters and emitters. When integrated with a blue TADF layer, this dual&#8208;layer design enables 100% internal quantum efficiency through TADF&#8208;enabled triplet harvesting and chiral amplification via selective absorption of blue photons with a specific polarization direction, generating amplified white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). The resulting white CP&#8208;OLED (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) achieves a record |gEL| of 0.34 alongside an EQEmax of 6.3%, demonstrating the unprecedented white CP&#8208;OLEDs when considering both EQE and gEL values. By optimizing the TADF doping ratio, a cool&#8208;white CP&#8208;OLED is realized with an EQE of 14.7% and |gEL| of 0.32. This work establishes a material orthogonal engineering to decouple exciton&#8208;chirality interdependencies, opening avenues for fabricating high&#8208;performance CPEL devices.

         <title>Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted Dual Acid Sites in WO3&#8208;x Catalysts Facilitate Direct Photocatalytic Hydrodeoxygenation of Hydroxy Groups in Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity enhancement strategy has been developed to realize the direct photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of different alcohols under ambient conditions. A WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to drive the whole reaction. The Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites have been&#160;demonstrated to be the main sites for the photocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation of hydroxy groups.








Abstract
Efficient hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the hydroxy groups (C&#9472;OH) in alcohol molecules has attracted substantial attention due to its importance in many research fields such as organic synthesis and biomass conversion. Photocatalytic C&#9472;OH direct HDO is a promising but challenging process because of the difficulty in C&#9472;O bond activation due to the higher bond energy and strong polarity. A polarity enhancement strategy is proposed and a WO3&#8208;x catalyst possessing Lewis&#8211;Br&#248;nsted dual acid sites is developed to realize the direct HDO of alcohols under ambient conditions. The C&#9472;O bond is first heterolytic cleaved to produce the carbocation intermediate and then the carbocation will combine with a proton and photogenerated electrons to form a new C&#9472;H bond. The synergistic effect of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites plays a key role in promoting the C&#9472;O bond cleavage. A series of comparative experiments, spectral characterizations&#160;and DFT calculations were&#160;used to demonstrate this new photocatalytic HDO pathway. Different alcohols, including polyols, can be directly converted into corresponding alkanes over this system. The present work discloses a direct HDO process for the hydroxy groups in alcohols and provides a new horizon for the design of new photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Ring Flipping in a Threaded Pillar[5]Arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical force was used to flip the orientation of a hydroquinone ring in a threaded pillar[5]arene to reach an elusive conformation not accessible to other methods of activation. The flipping can be suppressed with large substituents on the axle or the macrocycle. This unique molecular motion provides a new mechanism to dissipate mechanical energy with rotaxanes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are popular macrocycles used in various supramolecular systems and materials due to their unique host&#8211;guest properties and ease of synthesis. Their pillar shape originates from the cyclic arrangement of methylene&#8208;bridged hydroquinone groups. They usually exist in one of two conformations where all the hydroquinone rings are oriented in the same direction (left or right), which is the source of their planar chirality. However, the controlled formation of pillar[n]arenes with intermediate conformations, for example, where only one ring is inverted, remains a challenge. Here we show how mechanical force can be used to reach this elusive conformation via the force&#8208;induced flipping of a single hydroquinone ring in a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based rotaxane. We show that the flipping motion can be controlled with the shape of the stopper and the axle, as well as with the nature of the pillar[5]arene substituents. This flipping behavior acts as a mechanical damper by slowing the scission of the polymer under tension. These results show how mechanical force can be used to access synthetically challenging supramolecular architectures, and we anticipate that this new dampening mechanism will prove useful in the formation of tougher materials.

         <title>Probing Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution at Individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 Photocatalyst Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;SECM was used to probe the photocurrent and to map H2 and O2 evolution rates during water splitting on individual Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8722;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles, observing catalytic heterogeneity on the microscale.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;based photocatalysts for overall water splitting convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel without the use of any photovoltaic devices. As such they have the potential to revolutionize renewable energy production on Earth. While proven efficiencies have reached 1.1%, further improvements of photocatalyst technology depend on a better understanding of energy loss mechanisms on the individual particle level. Here, we conduct the first in operando photoelectrochemical measurements on individual micrometer&#8208;sized Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 photocatalyst particles. We find that the photocatalyst particles behave mainly as water oxidation photoanodes reaching up to 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#160;V versus RHE and a photovoltage of &#8764;1.00 V under 4.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 ultraviolet illumination. This proves that charge separation in the unbiased Al:SrTiO3/Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 catalyst is driven by a junction at the n&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;liquid contact. While O2 is detected symmetrically around photocatalyst particles, uneven H2 evolution profiles reflect an irregular Rh2&#8211;yCryO3 cocatalyst distribution. Additionally, the H2 evolution activity varies significantly between different photocatalyst particles. This suggests that performance gains are possible by better controlling catalyst composition on the microscale.

         <title>Abnormal Anti&#8208;Kasha Emission and TADF in Anionic Cycloarylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The removal of {FeCp} moieties in two ferrocene&#8208;dopped cycloarylenes via reductive cleavage approach unveils the intrinsic optical properties of anionic cycloarylenes. 13&#8211; exhibits a mixed emission from S2&#8594;S0 and S1'&#8594;S0, while 24&#8211; follows Kasha's rule displaying an S1'&#8594;S0 emission, notably, both anionic cycloarylenes display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond scale.








Abstract
Incorporation of non&#8208;benzoid rings into cycloarylenes significantly alters their molecular geometry and optical behavior. Recently, we synthesized two ferrocene&#8208;doped cycloarylenes, (CpFe)3&#8208;1 and (CpFe)4&#8208;2. However, the {FeCp} moieties in these architectures limited their optical properties. In this work, we report a reductive Fe&#9472;Cp bond cleavage approach that enables the removal of {FeCp} moieties efficiently, yielding two anionic cycloarylenes, 13&#8211; and 24&#8211;. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals different structure deformation between two charged species including molecular symmetry and &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that both 13&#8211; and 24&#8211; exhibit steady emission at 560 and 587&#160;nm, respectively, with noticeable high quantum yields (59.70% and 84.99%). 13&#8211; violates Kasha's rule via a rare mixed emission from S2&#8594;S0 and S1'&#8594;S0, whereas 24&#8211; adheres to the conventional S1'&#8594;S0 decay. Furthermore, both compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as the first example observed in cycloarylenes, with lifetimes reaching the millisecond scale. This work establishes alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated reductive cleavage as an effective strategy to break Fe&#9472;Cp bond and provides new insight into the photophysical behavior of charged molecular nanocarbons, paving the way for the rational design of functional molecular materials.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Polystyrene Into Benzene for Recycling and Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 41, October 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical degradation of polystyrene into benzene through ball milling is demonstrated for the first time. The benzene generated can be used to synthesize the styrene monomer for a closed&#8208;loop recycling or be converted into benzophenone through a mechanochemical cascade Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation for upcycling.








Abstract
Synthetic plastics sourced from petroleum have gained widespread use since the 1950s. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most extensively used plastics, as it is colorless, has high mechanical strength, and exhibits excellent chemical and thermal stability; however, it is also one of the least recycled plastics because of the high cost and low profit in recycling. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanochemical recycling approach that allows PS to be efficiently degraded into benzene when it is ground in a ball mill with AlCl3. For example, when 165&#160;kDa PS pellets are milled with AlCl3, the extent of degradation reaches 90% at 15&#160;min. Isotope labeling experiments indicate that both ambient water and the polymer backbone can be proton sources for the formation of benzene. The benzene generated in the mechanochemical degradation can be used to synthesize styrene, which can be repolymerized to produce polystyrene, allowing for the closed&#8208;loop recycling of PS. In addition, a mechanochemical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation between the generated benzene and the subsequently added benzoic anhydride produces benzophenone in 40%&#8211;50% yield. The mechanochemical degradation process demonstrated here is solvent&#8208;free, cost&#8208;effective, and energy&#8208;efficient, providing a promising route for the chemical recycling and upcycling of PS.

         <title>Design and Preparation of Self&#8208;Adaptive and Robust Solid&#8208;State Elastomeric Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery Inspired by Rubber Tire</title>

         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte inspired by rubber tires is designed, combining molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. By optimizing the elastomer&#8208;to&#8208;DEE ratio and integrating a polyethylene scaffold, the SSEE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1) and low interfacial resistance. It retains 88.33% capacity after 800 cycles in full&#8208;cell configurations.








Abstract
The development of safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes remains a central challenge for advancing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) toward practical deployment. Inspired by the durable, deformable nature of rubber tires, we report the design and preparation of a self&#8208;adaptive solid&#8208;state elastomeric electrolyte containing a deep eutectic electrolyte, termed PMEC, which integrates molecular&#8208;level plasticizer dispersion, mechanical flexibility, and interfacial adaptivity. The PMEC membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.37 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C), a high Li&#8314; transference number (0.64), excellent elasticity, and robust interfacial adhesion (36.34&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2). Structural characterizations confirm its amorphous and homogeneously mixed nature, while micro&#8208;Raman and XPS/TOF&#8208;SIMS analyses reveal uniform component distribution and the formation of an organic&#8211;inorganic gradient SEI layer on lithium. These features enable exceptional electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full batteries, including over 2000 h of stable cycling and &gt;800 cycles at 0.5&#160;C in LFP|PMEC|Li batteries with &gt;88% capacity retention. Moreover, PMEC&#8208;based pouch batteries maintain functionality under severe mechanical abuse. This tire&#8208;inspired electrolyte&#160;design offers a generalizable platform for high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Activating Co2+/Co3+ Redox Couple Mediated&#8208;Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl Furfuryl Under Low Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption of OH&#8722; on F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4, while the highly electronegative lattice F atoms enhance the oxidability of Co3+&#8208;OHads. This synergy enables F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 to catalyze the low&#8208;potential eHMFOR mediated by the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple.








Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalysts are promising candidates for electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (eHMFOR). However, the activity origin for eHMFOR on most cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalysts is the Co3+/Co4+ redox couple at the high&#8208;potential window, instead of the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple at the low&#8208;potential window, thus leading to a high onset potential above 1.3&#160;V. Herein, we developed F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 catalyst containing abound oxygen vacancies and lattice fluorine (F) heteroatom, which activates the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple for eHMFOR at the low&#8208;potential window, e.g., 1.15&#160;V. Oxygen vacancies prompt the electrochemical generation of Co3+&#8208;OHads at low potentials, and meanwhile, lattice F heteroatoms enhance the electrophilicity of Co3+&#8208;OHads. Benefiting by those unique structure, F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 catalyst effectively electro&#8208;synthesizes 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural, with a high yield (95.3%) and Faradaic efficiency (96.1%). This work provides an intelligent strategy for achieving the low&#8208;potential eHMFOR mediated by the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple, unlocking significant potential for reducing the energy consumption in biomass conversion.

         <title>Structural Dependence of Catenand Effect: Thermodynamic and Kinetic Modulation of Catenane Coordination Properties via Ring&#8208;size and Exocyclic Substituent Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modifying ring size and exocyclic substituents, effects of ligand interlocking on metal coordination features is explored. Through systematic analysis of CuI catenanes, relationship between structural parameters of the interlocked ligands and coordination properties like geometry, stability, and reactivity is established. Insights from this study enable the design of switchable catalysts and establish principles for leveraging mechanical interlocking in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Although the effects of ligand interlocking on specific features of coordinated metal were first reported in 1980s&#8217;, strategies to precisely control these features through structural modifications of interlocked ligands remains underdeveloped. This limitation has hindered the broader exploitation of this unique class of coordination compounds across various fields of transition metal chemistry. Through a systematic comparison and detail analysis of a series of CuI catenane complexes, we show in this work that the size of the interlocked rings and exocyclic substituents are important structural parameters that regulate the exposure of the metal coordination sphere, which also influences the coordination geometry, electronic structures, spectroscopic, photophysical and electrochemical properties, as well as thermodynamic stability, ligand exchange kinetics, and chemical reactivity of the coordinated metal. Relationship between the structural features of the catenane and the extent of these effects is also revealed. These insights not only faciliate the rational design of a new type of switchable catenane catalyst wherein the interlocked structure is preserved, but also establish new principles for leveraging the unique effects of mechanical interlocking for diverse applications involving coordination complexes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Clerodin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin is reported. Key transformations included titanium(III) catalyzed cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene, metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol, and SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal to establish the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif. 








Abstract
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin, the earliest isolated clerodane diterpenoid, has been achieved by tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization and modular synthetic strategies. The C19 oxidized trans&#8208;decalin core was constructed via a tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene. This process involved a titanium(III) catalyzed epoxide ring&#8208;opening/ene&#8208;yne cyclization. The furan fragment was assembled through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol precursor. A SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal established the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Tolerant and Scalable Diffusio&#8211;Osmotic Power Generation with Sulfonated Covalent Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the harvesting of salinity gradient energy via diffusio&#8211;osmosis. This approach eliminates the need of selectivity and thus overcomes the permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off and concentration polarization, showing high power density and scalability. Notably, our material maintains power generation even with substantial pinholes, simplifying membrane fabrication than before.








Abstract
Salinity gradient energy extracted with the reverse electrodialysis technique is attracting great interest and has been suggested as a promising renewable and stable energy source. However, the reverse electrodialysis relies on highly charge&#8208;selective membranes, causing a range of problems including the selectivity&#8211;permeability trade&#8208;off, strong concentration polarization, and strict requirement on the material structure, severely limiting its viability for large scale applications. We demonstrate these problems may be addressed by adopting the diffusio&#8211;osmosis process to generate power using sulfonated covalent framework membranes (COF), which does not require any charge selectivity. As a result, the membrane shows much higher power density compared to similar&#8208;sized membranes and enables much higher scalability. Remarkably, the generator has loose requirement on material structure and could largely maintain its power generation performance even when a substantial number of pinholes are present. This could make the material fabrication significantly easier than before. We expect our work to advance the practical application of salinity gradient energy extraction.

A rollercoaster illustrates the competing pathways of para&#8208;substituted arylazo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trimethylpyrazole photoswitches during thermal Z/E isomerization. In their Research Article (e202514433), the groups of Leticia Gonz&#225;lez and Marko Mihovilovic show how the substituent directs the track: electron&#8208;donating groups favour a nonadiabatic rotational track via the lowest triplet state, while electron&#8208;withdrawing groups follow a conventional ground&#8208;state inversion track.

Which conformation will fall to the bottom of the potential well? Quantum chemistry calculations usually give a correct and unanimous answer, but a simple molecular photoswitch has pushed different levels of theory into a tug of war. In their Research Article (e202513560), R. J. C. Roque, S. R. Domingos and co&#8208;workers employ rotational spectroscopy to settle this dispute. As the cover picture suggests, their study extends into the microsolvated world to prompt whether a wet photoswitch is less&#160;controversial.

         <title>Influence of the Acid Reactivity of Carbenium Ions in Zeolites on the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we studied the Br&#248;nsted acid reactivity of polymethylbenzenium and alkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopentenyl cations, key intermediates in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. CD3CN selectively and reversibly deprotonates benzenium ions, while cyclopentenyl cations require stronger bases. These results reveal a reactivity scale and provide insight into carbocation chemistry in reactive environments.








Abstract
Carbocations are typical intermediates in acid catalyzed reactions in organic chemistry synthesis. Confinement within the framework of zeotype materials distinguishes the function of carbenium ions as catalytic centers in various chemical processes. A selective and reversible deprotonation event of benzenium ions built in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 during methanol conversion was observed by experiment and theory as a result of CD3CN dosage, denoting their higher acid reactivity compared to the cyclopentenyl cations, which undergo deprotonation only in presence of pyridine. This study uncovers the inverse relationship between the acid reactivity of carbenium ions of different nature and their stability in the surface&#8208;bound state.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cis/Trans Isomerization of a Metal Centre Involving a Metal&#8208;Organic Halogen&#8208;Bonded (MOXB) Cocrystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented work demonstrates a cocrystallization&#8208;enabled mechanochemical interconversion of geometrical isomers of a coordination complex, illustrating the use of halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven cocrystal formation for generating new metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours.








Abstract
Halogen bonding enables the mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling isomerization of an otherwise persistent cis&#8208;coordinated metal complex into the corresponding trans&#8208;isomer. The importance of halogen bonding for enabling the cis&#8594;trans isomerization of the metal centre is evidenced by real&#8208;time in situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction monitoring of the ball&#8208;milling experiments that showed the transient appearance of a cis&#8208;geometry metal&#8208;organic halogen&#8208;bonded (MOXB) cocrystal, which is rapidly replaced by the corresponding trans&#8208;geometry one, with any excess, non&#8208;halogen&#8208;bonded cis&#8208;geometry complex being retained throughout the milling experiment. The importance of cocrystallization for cis&#8594;trans isomerization is supported by periodic density&#8208;functional theory calculations which show that the process becomes notably more enthalpically favourable in the presence of the halogen bond donor. The presented work indicates that the formation of MOXB cocrystals can open the door to new, metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours, different from those of parent solid&#8208;state coordination complexes.

         <title>Tuning Solvation Structure Via Inductive and Steric Hindrance Effects for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inductive and steric hindrance from a highly fluorinated ether diluent weaken Li+&#8211;solvent coordination and enrich anion participation, yielding compact solvation shells resulting into the formation of a robust bilayer interphase, thus enabling&#160;&gt;6.5&#160;V stability and long&#8208;term cycling of 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 batteries.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has a high specific capacity and energy density, making it a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, stabilizing LiCoO2 at elevated charging cut&#8208;off voltages remains challenging due to the severe interfacial degradation, particularly the instability of the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) under oxidative conditions. Herein, we propose a novel push&#8211;pull electrolyte design strategy by incorporating a non&#8208;coordinating diluent, 1H,1H,5H&#8208;perfluoropentyl&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylether (HFE), which modulates the Li+ solvation structure through strong inductive and steric hindrance effects, thereby enabling the formation of a robust CEI on the LiCoO2 surface. Guided by molecular electrostatic potential analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance characterizations, the optimized electrolyte creates a tailored solvation environment that suppresses parasitic interfacial reactions and facilitates the formation of a bilayer interphase. As a result, the LiCoO2 cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with the HFE&#8208;containing electrolyte, delivering over 300 stable cycles at 4.6&#160;V in high&#8208;loading LiCoO2//Li cells (&#8764;11&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and retaining 77% capacity after 200 cycles in LiCoO2//Graphite full&#8208;cells at 4.5&#160;V. This solvation engineering strategy provides a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Formation of Monolithic Magnesium&#8211;Calcium Carbonates Through Aggregation of Carbonate&#8208;Cluster Nanodroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustrating the formation of monolithic amorphous magnesium&#8211;calcium carbonate through the aggregation of nanodroplets. The color coding indicates that the Mg content may differ between the surface and the core. The two solid&#8208;state packings of Mg&#8208;rich and Mg&#8208;deficient domains shown on the right are structurally equivalent. Each tiny cube represents an amorphous domain with distinct Mg content. The cubes serve as a convenient visual guide to the space&#8208;filling feature of the amorphous domains.








Abstract
Mineral nucleation is a fundamental process of paramount importance to various fields, including geology, biomineralization, and industrial manufacturing. Recently, studies on the biominerals of calcium carbonate and phosphate have revealed the presence of a dense liquid phase prior to the formation of an amorphous solid phase. Here, we show that liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation occurs in a non&#8208;aqueous solution where magnesium and calcium carbonates are dissolved in ethanol with excess triethylamine. The nanodroplets can be kinetically trapped by triethylamine. We found that molecular complexes of triethylamine, CO2, and ethanol molecules are in constant exchange with sizable carbonate clusters. We argue that nanodroplets comprising highly solvated carbonate clusters are the key entities in the nucleation process. Remarkably, the coalescence of the nanodroplets leads to the formation of a monolithic magnesium&#8208;calcium carbonate containing two distinct domains with different Mg content.

         <title>Crafting Immune&#8208;Cancer Cell Crosstalk via Modular Multilayer Logic DNA Nanoadaptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a modular DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) featuring multi&#8208;port scaffold and plug&#8208;and&#8208;play connectors that programs immune&#8208;cancer cell interactions via customizable multilayer logic gates responding to cellular antigens and microenvironmental cues, enabling on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing.








Abstract
Synthetic molecular recognition tools offer a promising approach to reconfigure cell&#8208;cell interactions, but engineering user&#8208;defined logic circuits to control intercellular communication in heterogeneous microenvironments endures as a critical barrier. Herein, we present a multilayer logic DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) to define immune&#8208;cancer cell crosstalk by a customized logic operation of multiple variables, including cell surface antigens and microenvironmental characteristics. The modular Magic&#8208;NA consists of a DNA di&#8208;tetrahedral scaffold featuring three ports at each terminal. These ports can be interfaced with a library of plug&#8208;and&#8208;play logic connectors specifically activated by molecular triggers and targeted to desired cells, enabling programmable design of both logic circuits and inputs. We demonstrated an AND&#8208;AND logic network in Magic&#8208;NA that guides natural killer (NK) cells to target cells for selective cytotoxicity, based on tumor microenvironment (TME) acidic pH, and cellular antigens PTK7 and MUC1. Furthermore, leveraging the multi&#8208;port design, we implemented an OR&#8208;AND logic gate system to achieve on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing. This nanoplatform provides a paradigm for manipulating cellular interactions through Boolean integration of cell&#8208;intrinsic markers and microenvironmental cues, advancing the development of precision cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Isolation of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Versatile Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic approach to anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) via ligand exchange of metalated ylides/diazomethanes with free carbenes is reported. The anionic NHOs adopt bent structures with delocalized anionic charge, which enables versatile reactivity, including the formation of highly functionalized NHOs, thermal rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines and generation of carbo(phosphino)carbene ligands.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have emerged as powerful bases and nucleophiles with broad applications in synthesis and catalysis. Here, we report a new synthetic approach to accessing their anionic derivatives through a formal ligand exchange reaction of metalated ylides or diazomethanes with free carbenes. The reaction was found to depend on the nature of the carbene, with more electrophilic carbenes reacting more readily via N2 and PPh3 extrusion, respectively. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses, combined with computational studies revealed that the anionic NHOs exhibit bent structures. In these structures, the anionic charge at the central carbon atom is partly delocalized into the carbene and the second substituent (Z). These stabilizing effects confer versatile reactivity at the central carbon atom, the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or at the Z substituent. While the predominant reactivity occurs at the central carbon atom&#8212;enabling the convenient synthesis of functionalized NHOs&#8212;anionic NHOs also undergo a thermally induced rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines via a skeletal rearrangement involving ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Based Type&#8208;I Nano&#8208;Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antitumor Photodynamic Therapy: H2S Synergistically Regulates PeT and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce a design strategy for activated photosensitizers (PSs) wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is combined with a process of self&#8208;assembly that can be regulated by endogenous H2S&#8212;a tumor&#8208;associated biomarker to favor Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. 








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on a combination of light and photosensitizers (PSs) to achieve local control over cancerous lesions. However, it is subject to limitations, including tumor hypoxia, low tumor targeting, off&#8208;target phototoxicity, and always&#8208;on fluorescence. Here, we propose a design strategy for activated nano&#8208;PSs (N&#8208;PSs) to simultaneously overcome the limitations of PDT, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is coupled with an endogenous H2S&#8208;regulated self&#8208;association process to promote Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. Using theoretical calculations, spectral analysis, and microscopic imaging, we verified the generation of self&#8208;assembly and occurrence of PeT. And it was also shown that H2S could synergistically inhibit the PeT and self&#8208;assembly, reflecting by a 21&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity at 635&#160;nm and 35&#8208;fold enhancement of the Type&#8208;I photochemical reaction as inferred from O2&#8722; generation. Moreover, the most promising self&#8208;assembled N&#8208;PS, Ts3&#8208;ONB, was found to almost completely inhibit tumor growth in mice under two&#8208;photon excitation through the synergistic regulation of PeT and self&#8208;assembly by endogenous H2S (V14 daysTs3&#8208;ONB + Light group/V14 daysControl group&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.02). As such, the synergistic combination of PeT and self&#8208;assembly is an effective design strategy for developing advanced N&#8208;PSs that can address some current PDT limitations.

         <title>AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;Deficient Eutectic Electrolytes Enable Reversible Iodine Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion for Aluminum Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion is unlocked in aluminum batteries by AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes, where the suppressed AlCl4&#8722; concentration extends anodic stability and inhibits Cl2 evolution. The I2 cathode delivers a large specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering a new strategy for energy&#8208;dense aluminum battery systems.








Abstract
Aluminum (Al) batteries are promising for sustainable and large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the inherent safety, low cost, and attractive metrics of the Al anode. However, the development of high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;capacity cathodes remains a key challenge. Herein, we achieve the reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion (i.e., I&#8722;/I0/I+) in Al batteries, wherein AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes are identified critical for stabilizing the conversion process. In contrast to ionic liquid electrolytes prone to parasitic Cl2 evolution, eutectic systems facilitate the I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion process with high reversibility and significantly suppressed Cl2 generation. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations reveal AlCl4&#8722; as the dominant species limiting anodic stability of the electrolyte, and its reduced presence in eutectic electrolytes directly enhances iodine conversion reversibility. The optimized electrolyte allows the I2 electrode to deliver a specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 (based on I2 mass), along with excellent cycling stability (83.8% retention over 1000 cycles). High&#8208;loading I2 electrodes (8.52&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) achieve a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and demonstrate practical feasibility in a single&#8208;layer pouch cell. This work establishes a new design framework for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries and opens avenues for advancing conversion chemistries in multivalent systems.

A novel Os(II)&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib (Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer) conjugate enables triple&#8208;action anticancer therapy by integrating photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction into a single molecule. Upon near&#8208;infrared light activation, this heterobimetallic complex exhibits potent antiproliferative effects in ovarian cancer models, triggering key ICD hallmarks, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, and HMGB1 secretion.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based anticancer agents offer unique opportunities to integrate multiple therapeutic modalities within a single molecular framework. Herein, we present the first Osmium(II)&#8208;Platinum(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib conjugate (Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer) that synergistically combines photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy via immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction. This heterobimetallic complex features a photoactive osmium(II) polypyridyl core, a platinum(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin, and the kinase inhibitor ceritinib as an axial ligand. Upon deep&#8208;red irradiation (&#955; = 740&#160;nm), the conjugate exhibits potent antiproliferative activity in ovarian 2D cancer cells and 3D tumour spheroids, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. In addition, Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer effectively inhibits cancer cell migration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the conjugate induces hallmarks of ICD, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, HMGB1 secretion and phagocytosis. This multifunctional approach highlights the potential of osmium(II)&#8208;platinum(IV) conjugates as promising candidates for overcoming resistance and immune evasion in high&#8208;grade ovarian carcinoma.

         <title>Permselective Covalent Organic Framework Membrane as Self&#8208;Extinguishing Separator for High&#8208;Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorine&#8208;containing COF&#8208;based (TF&#8208;COF) membrane has been prepared by interfacial polymerization for use as a multifunctional separator in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties and its ability to regulate the transport of lithium ions, to improve the overall safety and cycling stability of batteries.








Abstract
As electric vehicles continue to gain popularity, the demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies is growing rapidly. The separator, the most critical component in a battery, plays a key role in ensuring battery safety. However, uncontrolled ion transport and persistent safety concerns in promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) still present significant challenges. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorine&#8208;functionalized COF (TF&#8208;COF) membrane as a battery separator to enhance the overall safety and cycling stability of LIBs. Its permselective nature effectively suppresses the growth of lithium dendrites and minimizes the risk of short circuit. When exposed to open flames, its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties allow it to self&#8208;extinguish the fire up to three times, significantly prolonging the safe evacuation time when an accident occurs. Additionally, the intrinsic micropores of strongly lithophilic TF&#8208;COF separator facilitate uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, enabling high values of ionic conductivity (8.79&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S cm&#8722;1) and Li&#8314; transference number (tLi&#8330;, 0.86). The NCM811||Li cell with TF&#8208;COF separators demonstrated high&#8208;capacity retention of 87.6% after 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 0.5&#160;C. Our approach, leveraging the fire&#8208;retardant capabilities of permselective COF separators, offers a promising new pathway toward developing high&#8208;safety, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies with long&#8208;life cyclability.

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel electrochemical protocol for the deoxygenative arylation of bench&#8208;stable O&#8208;alkylisoureas as C(sp3) radical precursors via reductive activation. Combined with nickel catalysis, this methodology enables the deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of alcohol derivatives with a wide range of aryl electrophiles, offering a mild and efficient electrochemical strategy for C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods to employ naturally abundant alcohol derivatives as C(sp3) precursors for deoxygenative carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) cross&#8208;coupling holds significant value for expanding sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space. While progress has been made in this area, the field lacks readily accessible, bench&#8208;stable alkylation reagents capable of undergoing reductive activation to generate alkyl radicals. Herein, we report an electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed system for efficient C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) radical cross&#8208;coupling between aryl electrophiles (halides, triflates, tosylates, and boronic acids) and O&#8208;alkylisoureas as radical progenitors. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. Its synthetic utility is highlighted through the preparation of beclobrate analogs and bifonazole, as well as late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds. Mechanistic investigations support a radical cross&#8208;coupling pathway for this transformation.

         <title>Degradation of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binding Proteins by G4L&#8208;PROTAC via Quaternary Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bifunctional G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands, termed G4L&#8208;PROTACs, that integrate a macrocyclic hexaoxazole G4&#8208;binding moiety with the cereblon ligand of pomalidomide. G4L&#8208;PROTACs induce the degradation of G4&#8208;bound proteins in living cells via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, providing a novel approach to selectively modulate intrinsic G4&#8211;protein interactions and gain insight into G4 biology.








Abstract
G&#8208;Quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structures enriched in genomic regions critical for transcription and replication. These dynamic scaffolds recruit G4&#8208;binding proteins (G4BPs), thereby regulating diverse cellular processes. However, the functional roles of G4BPs in the G4&#8208;bound state remain poorly defined. Here, we report the development of G4L&#8208;PROTACs&#8212;bifunctional small molecules that couple a G4 ligand with an E3 ligase recruiter to achieve selective proteasomal degradation of G4&#8208;bound G4BPs. Unlike RNAi or CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, which eliminate proteins irrespective of binding state, G4L&#8208;PROTACs enable depletion of G4BPs only when associated with G4s. Using model G4 motifs from telomeres and the NRAS 5&#8242; UTR, we demonstrated in vitro ternary complex formation. In cells, G4L&#8208;PROTAC treatment reduced endogenous levels of the G4&#8208;resolving helicase DHX36, resulting in a marked increase in intracellular G4 abundance, as shown by BG4 immunofluorescence. This phenotype highlights the ability of G4L&#8208;PROTACs to modulate the G4&#8211;protein equilibrium in living cells. Notably, G4L&#8208;PROTACs do not induce G4&#8208;mediated transcriptional silencing, underscoring their precision in modulating nucleic acid&#8211;protein interactions. This strategy offers a powerful platform for probing G4&#8211;G4BP functions and holds promise for therapeutic targeting of G4&#8208;associated proteins.

         <title>Quantification and Optimization of Interfacial Ion Transport in Polymer/Ceramic Composite Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a quantitative model to estimate the interphase conductivity of solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes. Critical carrier transport parameters are experimentally determined based on a self&#8208;supported porous ceramic skeleton, which enables uniform filler distribution.








Abstract
Solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries owing to their superior mechano&#8208;chemical compatibility, oxidation stability, and high ionic conductivity. While extensive studies confirm that the newly formed interphase critically enhances ionic conductivity, its quantitative contribution remains experimentally unverified for any composite electrolyte. This knowledge gap lacks a key guideline for designing commercially viable solid electrolytes thereby hinders the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge arises from the conventional low&#8208;dimensional fillers used in the composite electrolytes that tend to aggregate to create non&#8208;uniform interphase distribution thus complicating the determination of critical carrier transport parameters. To address this, we fabricate three&#8208;dimensional Li6.4Al0.1La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 self&#8208;supported porous skeletons as fillers, in which 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is in situ polymerized to establish a composite model system. Using advanced characterization techniques, we determine the geometric parameters governing carrier transport and develop a corresponding model to estimate interphase conductivity.

&lt;p&gt;This study establishes a quantitative model to estimate the interphase conductivity of solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes. Critical carrier transport parameters are experimentally determined based on a self-supported porous ceramic skeleton, which enables uniform filler distribution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for solid-state batteries owing to their superior mechano-chemical compatibility, oxidation stability, and high ionic conductivity. While extensive studies confirm that the newly formed interphase critically enhances ionic conductivity, its quantitative contribution remains experimentally unverified for any composite electrolyte. This knowledge gap lacks a key guideline for designing commercially viable solid electrolytes thereby hinders the development of solid-state batteries. A key challenge arises from the conventional low-dimensional fillers used in the composite electrolytes that tend to aggregate to create non-uniform interphase distribution thus complicating the determination of critical carrier transport parameters. To address this, we fabricate three-dimensional Li&lt;sub&gt;6.4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; self-supported porous skeletons as fillers, in which 1,3-dioxolane is in situ polymerized to establish a composite model system. Using advanced characterization techniques, we determine the geometric parameters governing carrier transport and develop a corresponding model to estimate interphase conductivity. Remarkably, the interphase exhibits a room-temperature conductivity of 2.5 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 33-fold higher than that of the bulk composite electrolyte. We attribute this enhancement to Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions that increase initiator concentration at the interphase, producing short-chain interfacial poly(1,3-dioxolane) with enlarged free volume for rapid Li-ion conduction. By applying this mechanistic understanding and coating the Li&lt;sub&gt;6.4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; skeleton with a stronger Lewis base (Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), we further optimize interphase conductivity to 12 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The applicability of the composite electrolytes is demonstrated in high-energy solid-state batteries with both sulfur and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes paired with lithium metal anodes.

         <title>Tuning Microscopic Water Orientation in Nickel Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Commercial&#8208;Scale CO2 Electrolysis to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 clusters modify Ni&#8211;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts to tune interfacial water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, dramatically enhancing proton supply for electrochemical CO2 reduction. This water orientation engineering enables nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at 50&#8211;600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cells and &gt;96% efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in membrane electrode assemblies with 118 h stability.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to carbon monoxide (CO) offers a sustainable route for fuel and chemical production. Achieving commercial&#8208;scale performance remains difficult, largely due to limited proton supply at high current densities. While single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity, their isolated active sites limit simultaneous optimization of CO2 activation and water dissociation. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of interfacial water orientation on water dissociation kinetics, but this factor remains underexplored in ECR systems. Here, we demonstrate that modifying Ni&#8211;N4 catalysts with CeO2 clusters alters the microscopic orientation of interfacial water, thereby enabling industrial&#8208;scale CO production. The CeO2&#8208;modified Ni&#8211;N4 achieves nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at current densities ranging from 50 to 600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cell and maintains 96% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. In a membrane electrode assembly, it sustains over 96% Faradaic efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 and maintains &gt;95% for 118 h at 150&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that CeO2 shifts the water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, thereby lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and accelerating protonation. This work demonstrates that interfacial water orientation manipulation is a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts in CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Driving Multi&#8208;Step Regioselectivity in On&#8208;Surface Polymer Synthesis by Molecular Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective polymerization of dicyclopentaanthracene on Au(111) can be controlled by tuning molecular coverage. Low coverage yields 1D polymers, medium coverage produces quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymers, and higher coverage drives 2D porous networks. These findings demonstrate coverage as a key parameter to steer regioselectivity and polymer dimensionality.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has revolutionized the design of low&#8208;dimensional organic nanomaterials, introducing unprecedented families of compounds while offering precise control over their structural and functional properties. A critical challenge in this field is achieving regioselective control over covalent bond formation, which is essential for tailoring polymerization processes. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach toward regioselective polymerization on Au(111) using a dicyclopentaanthracene precursor, an acene derivative that comprise two terminal indene moieties. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal a molecular coverage&#8208;dependent regioselective homocoupling mechanism. At low coverage, one&#8208;dimensional polymers formed via indenyl couplings in anti&#8208;configuration dominate, involving both five&#8208;membered rings of the precursor. Increasing the coverage to half a monolayer shifts the regioselectivity, yielding a quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymer through indenyl couplings that engage only one five&#8208;membered ring of each precursor. At higher coverages, a two&#8208;dimensional porous network emerges, driven by the activation of the four benzylic positions of the molecular precursor. Our findings highlight the ability to steer regioselectivity and, consequently, polymer dimensionality by controlling molecular coverage, significantly advancing the fields of on&#8208;surface synthesis and polymer science.

         <title>Suppressed Concentration Quenching Via Divalent Eu/Sr Alloying in Hybrid Iodides Scintillators Toward Bright Luminescence for X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divalent Eu/Sr&#8208;based bimetallic hybrid iodide scintillators exhibit 1D [Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI6]4&#8722; octahedra chains, suppressing nonradiative energy loss effectively by maintaining optimal spacing and dispersion between adjacent Eu(II) emission centers. The suppressed quenching benefits to realize a high PLQY to 92.2%, excellent LY of 54&#160;000 &#177; 300&#160;ph MeV&#8722;1 and extremely low detection limits of 49.9 nGy s&#8722;1. The large&#8208;area ceramic wafer counterparts demonstrate high resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 15.7&#8201;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Overcoming concentration quenching in rare&#8208;earth&#8208;activated luminescent materials always remains a challenge for enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we report two divalent Sr&#8208;based hybrid iodides, (Ph3MeP)SrI3 and (Ph3EtP)SrI3 (Ph3MeP&#160;=&#160;methyltriphenylphosphonium, Ph3EtP&#160;=&#160;ethyltriphenylphosphonium), and equivalent Eu/Sr alloying have been identified experimentally in the full range of 0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;1 for (Ph3MeP)Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI3 and (Ph3EtP)Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI3. These Eu/Sr&#8208;based hybrid iodides exhibit 1D [Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI6]4&#8722; octahedra chains, suppressing nonradiative energy loss effectively by maintaining optimal spacing and dispersion between adjacent Eu(II) emission centers. Upon even heavily Eu(II) alloying, (Ph3MeP)Sr0.5Eu0.5I3 exhibits efficient green emission (&#955;em = 525&#160;nm) with a high PLQY of &#8764;92.2%. Accordingly, it achieves a high scintillation light yield of 54&#160;000 &#177; 300&#160;ph MeV&#8722;1 and a low detection limit of 49.9 nGy s&#8722;1. Furthermore, ceramic wafers counterparts of Eu/Sr alloy prepared via cold sintering process demonstrate high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 15.7 lp mm&#8722;1. These findings not only present a new family of hybrid bimetallic iodides via Eu/Sr alloying, but also provides structurally guided strategy to suppress concentration quenching toward bright luminescence for scintillation applications.

Accordingly, it achieves a high scintillation light yield of 54&#160;000 &#177; 300&#160;ph MeV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low detection limit of 49.9 nGy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, ceramic wafers counterparts of Eu/Sr alloy prepared via cold sintering process demonstrate high-resolution X-ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 15.7 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings not only present a new family of hybrid bimetallic iodides via Eu/Sr alloying, but also provides structurally guided strategy to suppress concentration quenching toward bright luminescence for scintillation applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Rearrangement, and Disassembly of {Cr6} Horseshoe Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS2), and low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we elucidate the self&#8208;assembly, rearrangement, and disassembly processes of polymetallic {Cr6}x (x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 5) horseshoe oligomers.








Abstract
Molecular assemblies are commonly found in biological systems, and designing synthetic mimics of these is a challenge for modern chemistry. Here, we apply ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS), density functional theory (DFT), and mass&#8208;selective electrospray ion beam deposition followed by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to decipher the self&#8208;assembly, rearrangement, and disassembly processes of {Cr6}n horseshoe oligomers (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;5). Activated tandem IM&#8208;MS reveals the oligomer disassembly in detail, highlighting the stability of the dimer unit. When n&#160;=&#160;2 and n = 3 oligomers are deposited on surfaces, we observe the rearrangement of dimers and trimers to dimers of dimers, and at higher coverages, the formation of an unexpected hexagonal&#8208;like network. In its entirety, the experimental and computational data provide a convincing framework for the analysis of supramolecular assembly processes in noncrystalline phases that could be used in future design strategies.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced&#8208;Emission Polymer Donor Improves the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells by Suppressing Nonradiative Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent aggregation&#8208;enhanced&#8208;emission polymer donor, namely PiNTSO&#8208;F, was designed and incorporated into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, which optimizes the D&#8211;A interfaces, reduces the nonradiative recombination rate, and enhances charge generation efficiency. As a result, the ternary device achieves a low &#916;Vnr of 0.192&#160;V and an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.36%.








Abstract
Nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) is a critical factor that limits the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Introducing highly luminescent materials is a promising approach to reduce &#916;Vnr. The majority of prior works have focused on enhancing luminescence of low&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors, whereas highly luminescent donors have received far less attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a highly luminescent polymer donor with aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission property, namely PiNTSO&#8208;F, and incorporated it into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based system. Interestingly, PiNTSO&#8208;F was found to locate at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface, where it optimizes the interfacial morphology, energetic landscape, and charge dynamics of the active layer. Consequently, the nonradiative recombination rate in the ternary system is significantly reduced, while the interfacial charge generation efficiency is simultaneously improved to nearly unity, effectively minimizing &#916;Vnr of the device. As a result, the ternary devices achieve a low &#916;Vnr of 0.192&#160;V and a high efficiency of 20.36%. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for suppressing &#916;Vnr through developing the highly luminescent polymer donors as a third component, providing mechanistic insights that enable high&#8208;performance OSCs with minimized voltage loss.

         <title>Electrochemical Late&#8208;Stage Stitching of Tryptophan Peptides via N&#9472;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a versatile electrochemical platform for macrocyclization and stapling of endogenous peptides, featuring straightforward operation, rapid kinetics, and tunable ring size/geometry. Using sulfur&#8208;containing stapling reagents of varying lengths, tryptophan residues undergo rapid crosslinking cyclization, efficiently delivering 21&#8208; to 29&#8208;membered cyclopeptides with constrained conformations. This protocol enhances the bioactivity of linear peptide precursors, offering a novel strategy for cyclic peptide modification.








Abstract
Late&#8208;stage diversification of peptides via selective modification of endogenous amino acid side chains provides a powerful strategy to access analogues with enhanced bioactivity and tailored physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating peptide&#8208;based drug discovery. However, precise manipulation of short peptides comprising canonical amino acids&#8212;particularly control over backbone conformation&#8212;remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a robust electrochemical strategy for constructing macrocyclic peptides through direct incorporation of diverse aryl sulfur linkers. This method enables tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective crosslinking via electrochemical reaction with aryl thiosulfonates, leading to efficient formation of S&#9472;N bonds. The resulting sulfur&#8208;bridged multi&#8208;aryl macrocycles act as conformationally adaptive scaffolds that reshape the peptide backbone architecture. This conformational remodeling grants access to previously inaccessible structural spaces that are critical for modulating biological activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Degradable Polyimines Through Deborylative Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the general, room&#8208;temperature, and scalable synthesis of degradable polyimines by deborylative polycondensation under anhydrous and neutral conditions, which can improve the degree of polymerization, increase the stability of products, and reduce the operational difficulty during purification. This versatile strategy enables the synthesis of a series of new polyimine materials composed of both conjugated and nonconjugated backbones.








Abstract
Polyimines are degradable and have found applications in separation techniques, gene delivery, optoelectronics, and porous materials. Conventional methods to synthesize polymines involve dehydrative polycondensation, which requires the addition of acid catalysts and drying reagents and has limited substrate scope. In this work, a boron&#8208;mediated strategy has been developed for the synthesis of polyimines. First, we describe the borylation of diamines at the nitrogen sites to afford N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines. Due to the N&#9472;B bond formation, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines react fast, irreversibly, and completely with the dialdehydes via an unusual deborylative polycondensation process. Furthermore, methods for deborylative polycondensation reactions were developed under anhydrous and neutral conditions, yielding polyimines containing both aryl and alkyl backbones at room temperature in good to excellent yields. This polymerization protocol is scalable and reduces the operational difficulty in purifying the polyimines. These results provide a general and efficient polymerization tool for the practical synthesis of degradable polyimines.

         <title>Discovery of Antivirulence ClpP Inhibitors by Self&#8208;Resistance Gene&#8208;Guided Mining Coupled with Dual Functional Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Streptoclipamide A, a potent ClpP inhibitor (IC50&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM), was discovered by self&#8208;resistance&#8208;guided genome mining coupled with dual functional screening. It uniquely suppresses MRSA virulence toxins without growth inhibition and synergizes with vancomycin in murine pneumonia. This work expands the ClpP inhibitor arsenal and provides a blueprint for resistance&#8208;conscious antimicrobial development.








Abstract
The global threat of MRSA demands innovative anti&#8208;virulence strategies. Caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), a central virulence regulator in MRSA, represents an attractive yet underexploited target. Here, we developed a discovery platform integrating self&#8208;resistance gene&#8208;guided genome mining with dual functional screening, combining fluorometric&#8208;based assay and counter&#8208;screening against ADEP&#8208;induced ClpP activation.

&lt;p&gt;Streptoclipamide A, a potent ClpP inhibitor (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM), was discovered by self-resistance-guided genome mining coupled with dual functional screening. It uniquely suppresses MRSA virulence toxins without growth inhibition and synergizes with vancomycin in murine pneumonia. This work expands the ClpP inhibitor arsenal and provides a blueprint for resistance-conscious antimicrobial development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global threat of MRSA demands innovative anti-virulence strategies. Caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), a central virulence regulator in MRSA, represents an attractive yet underexploited target. Here, we developed a discovery platform integrating self-resistance gene-guided genome mining with dual functional screening, combining fluorometric-based assay and counter-screening against ADEP-induced ClpP activation. This led to the discovery of streptoclipamides A&#8211;G, novel hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide ClpP inhibitors from &lt;i&gt;str&lt;/i&gt; BGC, validated via heterologous expression and gene knockout. Structure&#8211;activity relationship studies enabled by engineered analogues identified key pharmacophores. Streptoclipamide A potently inhibits ClpP (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM) by engaging Thr72 via its C-21 hydroxyl group, confirmed by biophysics and self-resistance-conferring T72P mutation. Streptoclipamide A suppressed MRSA virulence in vitro by reducing critical toxin production, including &#945;-hemolysin, and demonstrated protection in &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; and murine pneumonia models. This work expands chemical diversity of ClpP-targeting agents, and establishes a genome mining-driven platform for discovering new therapeutics against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Statistical Sampling&#8208;Driven Design for Supported Bimetallic Nanocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A statistical sampling&#8208;driven strategy through the gas&#8211;solid nanoreactor approach was developed to rationally guide the preparation of bimetallic nanocatalysts on the basis of the comparative ease of bimetal alloy formation. Over metal oxide&#8208;supported PdAu&#8208;catalyzed model CO2 reduction reactions, the results not only realize the preparation of the alloy or phase separation of supported PdAu, but also unveil the key factors governing the activity and product selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation.








Abstract
Tailoring supported bimetals to alloyed or phase&#8208;separated structures is of vital importance while this process is blocked by the support interferences during universal impregnation processes. Conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches rooted in chemical intuition often lack efficiency and generality. Here, we present a design strategy guided by the statistical sampling of comparative ease of alloy formation through the metadynamics&#8208;based gas&#8211;solid nanoreactor approach, which enables the rational and systematic development of bimetallic nanocatalysts (NCs). Using metal oxide&#8208;supported PdAu coupling with model CO2 reduction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, the integrated theoretical and experimental results not only validated the reliability of simulation results but also successfully predicted and realized the alloy formation or phase separation of supported PdAu NCs. The generated PdAu alloys over CeO2 weaken the metallicity of supported Pd species and thus the catalytic hydrogenation property, but increase moderate basicity, contributing to activated CO2 hydrogenation to CO via a formate intermediate. However, the phase separation of Pd and Au over TiO2 support promotes formic acid production efficiency attributed to increasing weak basicity to accelerate CO2 activation during a bicarbonate pathway. These findings highlight statistical sampling as a general broadly applicable framework for the rational design of advanced bimetallic NCs.

         <title>From Global Flexibility to Local Flexibility: Enable A&#8211;B Stacked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Complex Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy that converts global flexibility into local flexibility by grafting molecular &#8220;lockers&#8221; onto a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling efficient separation of complex gas mixtures. The locked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits exceptional performance in the one&#8208;step purification of C2H4, achieving a purity exceeding 99.9% from quaternary gas mixtures.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents can achieve exceptional separation performances under appropriate stimuli, especially for complex gas mixtures. However, their intrinsic global flexibility often leads to unsatisfactory separation selectivity, which hampers the practical applications. Herein, we propose a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy to convert an A&#8211;B stacked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (GF&#160;=&#160;global flexibility) into Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF (LF&#160;=&#160;local flexibility) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H4 separation from multiple complex gas mixtures. The grafted methyl groups serve as lockers to suppress global flexibility while preserving local stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. As a result, Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits a 10&#8208;fold increase in C2H2 uptake (1.95&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) compared to Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (0.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) at 0.1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K, yielding a record selectivity of 9.2 for C2H2/C2H4 (50/50) among similar adsorbents. Moreover, the selective capture of C2H6 and CO2 impurities is also significantly enhanced. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF column enables direct separation of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&gt;99.9%) with a high productivity of 0.79&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 from a quaternary C2H2/C2H6/CO2/C2H4 (1v/33v/33v/33v) gas mixture. Density functional theory calculations reveal a lower deformation energy (&#8722;3.99&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) and specific adsorption sites for Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF.

Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the Cd-MOF-LF column enables direct separation of polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;99.9%) with a high productivity of 0.79&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from a quaternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1v/33v/33v/33v) gas mixture. Density functional theory calculations reveal a lower deformation energy (&#8722;3.99&#160;kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and specific adsorption sites for Cd-MOF-LF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reducing Energetic Disorder for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Urbach Energy by in Situ NH3 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ ammonia release strategy was employed to suppress the Urbach energy of perovskite films and quantify the link between energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. This yielded a 52&#160;mV reduction, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.182&#160;V, and a power conversion efficiency of 26.26%.








Abstract
The high disorder in perovskite materials leads to severe carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, which directly determines the energy loss of photovoltaic devices. Currently, modulation of energetic disorder in perovskite solar cells and its correlation with open&#8208;circuit voltage losses (VOC, loss) remain insufficiently understood. We regulated the perovskite crystallization process by in situ NH3 generation, thereby enhancing the perovskite degree of energetic order. Density functional theory calculations reveal that lone&#8208;pair electrons on the N atom of the NH3 molecule coordinate with Pb2+, increasing the defect formation energy of lead vacancies (VPb), Pb&#8208;on&#8208;I antisite (PbI), and I&#8208;on&#8208;Pb antisite (IPb) to 5.61, 0.37, and 4.09&#160;eV, respectively. As a result, we obtained energetic ordered perovskite film with an Urbach energy of 23.7&#160;meV. The champion device exhibited a reduced VOC, loss by over than 50&#160;mV and achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.182&#160;V with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.26%. Under the ISOS&#8208;D protocols, the device maintains over 95% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of nitrogen storage and over 90% after 700&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C. And the 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 cm2 mini&#8208;modules achieved a PCE of 21.31%, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Multifunctional Electronic Textiles for the Simultaneous Detection and Uptake of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A woven polyester fabric conformally coated with microcrystals of bismuth&#8208;based conductive coordination polymer absorbs H2S plume. As reported by Katherine A. Mirica et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202509883), the resulting smart membrane acts as a variable resistor within an electronic circuit, giving a concentration&#8208;dependent signal as the fabric captures the gas. A molecular visualization shows polysulfide chains wrapping Bi nodes that promote multifunctional performance of detection, capture, and detoxification in one electronic textile.

         <title>Chlorine Radical&#8208;Driven, Oxygen&#8208;Independent Afterglow Nanoplatform for Tumor Microenvironment&#8212;Adaptive Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel oxygen&#8208;free afterglow luminescence mechanism driven by &#183;Cl and synthesize afterglow nanoparticles Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG based on this mechanism. The afterglow luminescence generated by this mechanism is independent of oxygen concentration, making it a suitable tool for imaging various hypoxic physiological environments. Meanwhile, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG can monitor the oxidative stress levels of tumors in real time through afterglow luminescence intensity.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence (afterglow) imaging offers exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios by eliminating tissue autofluorescence, yet most organic systems depend on oxygen&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species and fail in hypoxic environments such as solid tumors. Herein, we report an oxygen&#8208;independent afterglow mechanism driven by chlorine radicals (&#183;Cl). Hemicyanine&#8208;centered nanoparticles (Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG) were prepared by nanoprecipitation, surface&#8208;decorated with AgCl heterostructures for light&#8208;activated &#183;Cl generation, and stabilized with methoxypolyethylene glycol. Upon irradiation, AgCl produces &#183;Cl, which adds across the dye's conjugated double bond to form metastable epoxide intermediates; subsequent epoxide decomposition releases stored chemical energy, re&#8208;exciting the dye and yielding intense afterglow emission regardless of O2 concentration. This strategy extends to cyanine and porphyrin fluorophores, underscoring its generality. A pH&#8208;responsive variant (Hcy&#8208;pH@AgCl) further enables afterglow imaging of pH&#8208;responsive. In vivo, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG achieves high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging and leverages the oxidative potency of &#183;Cl to induce pronounced photodynamic therapy via oxidative stress and DNA single&#8208;electron oxidation. Together, these findings establish a new paradigm for oxygen&#8208;free afterglow systems and deliver a versatile theranostic platform for imaging and treatment in dynamic, hypoxia&#8208;associated pathologies.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Umpolung for Strain&#8208;Release Difunctionalization of (Aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a radical umpolung strategy for regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes using sulfinate&#8208;derived electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, enabling ring&#8208;opening and subsequent functionalization with acyl derivatives, aldehydes, or CO2 under mild conditions








Abstract
Azetidines and cyclobutanes are increasingly valued as potent bioisosteres of pyridines and benzenes in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a radical umpolung strategy for the regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) that exhibits complementary regioselectivity to conventional polar strain&#8208;release methods. This approach uses photocatalytically generated electrophilic sulfonyl radicals from readily available sulfinates to selectively add to nitrogen in ABBs and electron&#8208;rich sites of BCBs, triggering strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening. The resulting radical intermediates are subsequently captured through two pathways: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling enables efficient acylation, while single&#8208;electron reduction generates carbanions capable of nucleophilic addition to electrophiles such as CO2 and aldehydes. The umpolung reactivity of this protocol enhances synthetic versatility by accommodating diverse azetidine functionalities under mild conditions to afford densely functionalized azetidines and cyclobutanes that are difficult to access through existing methods.

&lt;p&gt;We report a radical umpolung strategy for regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes using sulfinate-derived electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, enabling ring-opening and subsequent functionalization with acyl derivatives, aldehydes, or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azetidines and cyclobutanes are increasingly valued as potent bioisosteres of pyridines and benzenes in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a radical umpolung strategy for the regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) that exhibits complementary regioselectivity to conventional polar strain-release methods. This approach uses photocatalytically generated electrophilic sulfonyl radicals from readily available sulfinates to selectively add to nitrogen in ABBs and electron-rich sites of BCBs, triggering strain-release ring-opening. The resulting radical intermediates are subsequently captured through two pathways: &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross-coupling enables efficient acylation, while single-electron reduction generates carbanions capable of nucleophilic addition to electrophiles such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and aldehydes. The umpolung reactivity of this protocol enhances synthetic versatility by accommodating diverse azetidine functionalities under mild conditions to afford densely functionalized azetidines and cyclobutanes that are difficult to access through existing methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Assembly of a Defective Cu Catalyst for High Current CO2 Electrolysis to Methane in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electrochemical assembly strategy that forms a Cu(111) catalyst with vacancy defects. Integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer system, this catalyst achieved a high methane FE of 71.46% at a total current of 1.5 A, with a corresponding production rate of 0.28&#160;&#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and stable operation over 10&#160;h.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis to methane offers a promising route toward enabling long&#8208;term storage of renewable energy. However, electrolysis in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems using conventional Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts is typically limited by relatively low methane productivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, we conceived an electrochemical assembly strategy that forms a Cu(111)&#8208;dominant catalyst with vacancy defects. In an MEA system at a total current of 1.5 A, the catalyst (Def&#8208;Cu6) achieved a record methane FE of 71.46% and production rate of 0.28&#160;&#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, with relatively stable operation over 10&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal the crucial role of vacancy defects in a Cu(111) surface, which favors the hydrogenation of CO* and promotes methane formation over the competing CO* coupling pathway that leads to multicarbon products. Our findings demonstrate how vacancy defects can be tuned to control catalytic outcomes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition Enabled by Cage&#8208;Confined Photocatalysis for Precise Bicyclo[2.1.1]Hexane Construction</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] photocycloaddition between chalcones and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCBs was achieved through photoactive metal&#8211;organic cage (PMOC)confined catalysis. This strategy provides a highly atom economical and diastereoselective route to pharmaceutically relevant BCH bioisosteres, leveraging the unique spatial constraints of the supramolecular cage to control reactivity and selectivity. 








Abstract
We disclose a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] photocycloaddition between readily available chalcones and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) promoted by photoactive metal&#8211;organic cage (PMOC). This confined supramolecular catalysis method enables efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane (BCH) bioisosteres with remarkable atom economy and excellent diastereoselectivities, necessitating only 0.1&#160;mol% catalyst loading. The success of this organic transformation arises from the synergistic action of the PMOC as a nanoreactor to combine selective substrate preorganization through host&#8211;guest interactions, efficient Ru(II)&#8208;mediated triplet energy transfer, and nano&#8208;spatial confinement effect that precisely control [2&#960;+2&#963;] cyclization geometry while preventing competitive homodimerization.

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Driven Syn&#8208;/Anti&#8208;Conformational Regulation in Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition in nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors, achieved through strategic incorporation of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. Our systematic study reveals how conformational preferences affect molecular planarity, self&#8208;assembly, and photovoltaic performance, thus offering conformation&#8208;directed molecular design guidelines for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells.








Abstract
Molecular conformation is a critical structural attribute of organic molecules and polymers in addition to their constitution and configuration, thereby forming the foundation for understanding macroscopic material properties and device functionality. For nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) featuring multiple &#963;&#8208;bonds with high rotational degrees of freedom, significant challenges remain in precisely regulating molecular conformation, particularly in modulating the syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation preferences. Here, we demonstrate precise engineering of NFREAs through conformation&#8208;directed molecular design, achieving a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition via utilizing intramolecular noncovalent S&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions. This conformational regulation strategy enables a systematic investigation of how syn&#8208;/anti&#8208;conformational preferences influence molecular planarity and rigidity, self&#8208;assembly behavior, charge transport properties, and device performance. Our results reveal that the anti&#8208;conformation endows anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F with enhanced crystallinity, reduced reorganization energy, and improved charge carrier mobility compared to its syn&#8208;conformational counterpart. Consequently, binary and ternary devices based on anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 15.08% and 19.88%, respectively. This conformational engineering strategy unveils a previously overlooked dimension in molecular design, providing fundamental guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells through the rational manipulation of conformational landscapes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides is reported, wherein the allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes is demonstrated to proceed with broad substrate scope, accompanied by excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Sulfinamides, pivotal scaffolds in modern organic synthesis, have undergone a continuous evolution of synthetic methodologies over the past century, yet the precise construction of sulfur stereocenters remains a significant synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a versatile catalytic asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides through the direct allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes. Our methodology employs a catalytic system comprising copper salts, hydrosilanes, and readily accessible chiral ligands, which facilitates the in situ generation of organocopper surrogates via hydrocupration of allenes. This approach demonstrates remarkable substrate scope and excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity across a diverse array of sulfinamide products. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations, including detailed experimental studies and computational analyses, have been conducted to elucidate the reaction pathway and identify the key factors governing enantioselectivity.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks with Thiazole Linkages to Enhance Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer and Charge Separation in Photocatalytic Oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
A strategy is first reported for the development of highly active thiazole&#8208;linked photocatalysts by synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based D&#8211;A COF platforms. Thus, the TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF represents the rare example of photocatalytic oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in an aqueous system under ambient conditions, almost the highest activities among reported heterogeneous photocatalysts.








Abstract
The design of efficient covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as photocatalysts for C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation under green and mild conditions is highly desirable. Herein, TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF and TpAR&#8208;TZ COF, featuring thiazole linkages, were synthesized by combining 1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylcarboxaldehyde (Tp), sulfur (S8), and direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) components (2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone, AQ; 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthrone, AR). The TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF demonstrates impressive photocatalytic activity, achieving a 93% yield for phthalan oxidation under heterogeneous conditions&#8212;a rare example of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation in water under ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations reveal enhanced hydrogen atom abstraction capability coming from the increased number of d&#8208;HAT catalytic sites. Moreover, BdAQ&#8208;TZ COF and HbAQ&#8208;TZ COF were prepared by replacing Tp with 2,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Bd) or 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Hb), respectively. Dipole moment calculations and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy show that the increased number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde monomer improves the charge separation efficiency within the three COFs, thereby accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF. This work opens up new opportunities for designing highly active photocatalysts by using the synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor COF platforms, offering a sustainable route for the oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds under environmentally friendly conditions.

         <title>Improving Tandem Epoxidation Efficiency via Hydrogel Confinement Effect towards Photoelectrochemical Propylene Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of an efficient hydrogen peroxide&#8208;propylene oxide process for alkene epoxidation in a sustainable future is deeply based on faster H2O2 production and higher H2O2 conversion efficiency. Herein, a spatial confinement strategy is proposed to greatly reinforce the propylene epoxidation kinetics. An innovative multi&#8208;pass reflective flow reactor endowed with maximal optical transport and absorbance is also demonstrated.








Abstract
Propylene oxide (PO) is among the world's most abundantly produced commodity chemicals, but it suffers from an energy&#8208;intensive and highly polluting industrial production route. In this work, we present a tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) PO production system involving water oxidation to H2O2 via a BiVO4 photoanode and subsequent propylene epoxidation by titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst&#8208;loaded hydrogel using in situ&#8208;generated H2O2. The hydrogel encapsulated on the BiVO4 photoanode surface provides a confined space to enhance H2O2 enrichment, as well as propylene transport, thereby reinforcing the epoxidation kinetics with conversion efficiencies of 94.06% for H2O2 and 75.55% for propylene. With the assistance of solar energy, the PO productivity per unit of electricity can reach 6.10 mol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;kWh&#8722;1, which is the lowest electricity consumption for existing alkene epoxidation technology. For industrial scalability, a multi&#8208;pass light absorption configuration is designed for decimeter&#8208;sized reactor to address the issue of a plunge in solar to chemical (STC) efficiency arising from the scale&#8208;up of the photoanode, achieving the optimum light harvesting efficiency of 98.21% and STC efficiency of 5.57% which is comparable to its 1 cm2 counterpart (86% retention). The continuous PO productivity in flowing electrolyte can reach 1.74 mmol&#183;h&#8722;1 with a steady selectivity of 91.05% under AM 1.5G illumination. Finally, a techno&#8208;economic analysis is provided to offer targets that need to be met for economically compelling industrial implementation.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Driven Ni3S4 Gradient in NiFe&#8208;LDH Enables Durable Industrial&#8208;Scale Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH gradient heterostructure nanosheets grown on iron foams are constructed by a corrosion engineering strategy at room temperature within just 1 h. When employed as the anode catalyst in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH/IF demonstrates low overpotentials along with exceptionally long&#8208;term stability, maintaining efficient pure water splitting for 1000 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Designing low&#8208;cost yet highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is essential to enable sustainable green hydrogen generation. However, synthesis complexity, slow kinetics, and poor durability hinder industrial use. In this study, we present a corrosion&#8208;driven gradient engineering approach for the rapid, energy&#8208;free synthesis of Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH heterostructures on iron foam (IF) under ambient conditions. During spontaneous IF corrosion, a compositional and gradient structure forms, with Ni3S4 dominating the surface and NiFe&#8208;LDH enriching the core, establishing a continuous pathway for rapid electron transport. The catalyst exhibits superior OER performance, achieving low overpotentials of 297&#160;mV in 1&#160;M KOH and 326&#160;mV in simulated seawater at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Notably, in pure&#8208;water anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates industrial&#8208;grade performance, sustaining 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.85&#160;V with remarkable stability over 1,000 h of continuous operation. Operando spectroscopic studies unveil that SO42&#8722; leaching from surface Ni3S4 in the gradient structure provides dual protection against metal dissolution and chloride corrosion. Furthermore, the in situ formation of FeOOH synergistically stabilizes the catalytically critical Ni3+ species in NiOOH through strong Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Ni interfacial bonding, contributing to the exceptional durability. This work provides fundamental insights into corrosion&#8208;mediated catalyst design, offering a scalable pathway for developing industrial&#8208;grade electrocatalysts.

         <title>In Situ Construction of NaF&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase with Metallic Ce Sites for Stable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a substrate&#8208;driven in situ interfacial engineering strategy to construct NaF&#8208;rich SEI with metallic Ce active sites, which stabilizes the interphase, accelerates Na+ desolvation, and enables 90% ultrahigh DOD along with stable anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Developing reversible Na plating/stripping under high depth of discharge (DOD) is critical for stable anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs). Achieving high reversibility relies on a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), yet current strategies depend on high&#8208;concentration salts or fluorinated solvents, limiting their practicality. Herein, we demonstrate an in situ NaF&#8208;rich SEI with metallic Ce sites that bypasses electrolyte decomposition. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and TOF&#8208;SIMS revealed a conversion reaction between Na+ and CeF3@NC, forming NaF and metallic Ce sites during cycling. This substrate&#8208;driven well&#8208;defined NaF&#8208;rich SEI ensures interfacial stability even under high DOD. Moreover, metallic Ce sites exhibit strong PF6&#8722; affinity, facilitating Na+ desolvation by lowering the energy barrier for step&#8208;by&#8208;step anion extraction. Consequently, the anode achieved ultra&#8208;long stability of 5800&#160;h (20% DOD) and 1600&#160;h (90% DOD). The full cells delivered the impressive cycling stability for 500 cycles with 93.3% capacity retention, while a pouch cell retained 90.98% capacity after 300 cycles. Notably, the AFSMBs with high cathode loading (&gt;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) exhibited excellent stability, retaining 83.6% capacity over 100 cycles. This work provides new insights into engineering robust in situ SEI, paving the way for accelerating practical application of AFSMBs.

Notably, the AFSMBs with high cathode loading (&amp;gt;9&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibited excellent stability, retaining 83.6% capacity over 100 cycles. This work provides new insights into engineering robust in situ SEI, paving the way for accelerating practical application of AFSMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Mediated Growth of Oriented Membrane from 2D&#8208;Structured Zirconium MOF for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly face&#8208;on oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes of Zr&#8208;TCA were successfully fabricated for gas separation. Fine balancing of the gel&#8208;to&#8208;membrane process enabled horizontal layer deposition and well crystal intergrowth. Unprecedented gas separation performance in terms of high permeance and selectivity was achieved for CO2/N2 mixture. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional structured metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;structured MOF) membranes with functionalized and ordered&#8208;direction pores hold significant promise for efficient CO2 separation. However, the direct synthesis of such membranes remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a novel organic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated conversion strategy for direct transformation of a preformed metal&#8211;organic gel (MOG) into an oriented membrane of 2D&#8208;structured MOF. The MOG is initially synthesized and subsequently dissociated to release Zr6 clusters, which promotes the nucleation and growth of the MOF structure. Small organic molecules of formic acid are employed to modulate the coordination between Zr6 clusters and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;tricarboxyltriphenylamine ligand (TCA3&#8722;). By finely tuning the balance between crystallization and intergrowth kinetics, a highly oriented Zr&#8208;TCA membrane is fabricated, exhibiting excellent crystallinity and structural homogeneity. The resulting Zr&#8208;TCA membrane features nitrogen&#8208;functionalized, well&#8208;aligned pores oriented parallel to the direction of gas permeation; enabling outstanding CO2/N2 separation performance, with an exceptional CO2 permeance of 1857.3&#160;GPU and a high CO2/N2 selectivity of 39.2 at 0.12&#160;MPa and 25&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Tubular All&#8208;Benzene Nanocarbon with Evolving Excited&#8208;State Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tubular all&#8208;benzene nanocarbons (TANCs) featuring triple covalent linkers have been constructed by coaxially stacked cycloparaphenylene units. The chiral&#8208;TANC exhibits dynamic helicity with ultrafast untwisting motions within 8&#160;ps following photoexcitation. 








Abstract
Molecular nanocarbons with precisely defined conjugated scaffolds can provide an ideal platform for investigating mechanistic insights into photophysical properties. Here, we report the synthesis and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic characterization of two isomeric tubular all&#8208;benzene nanocarbon (TANC) molecules, named meso&#8208; and chiral&#8208;TANC, respectively. Structurally, they feature triple covalent linkages, with different connectivity, between coaxially stacked cycloparaphenylene units. While meso&#8208;TANC maintains conformational rigidity, chiral&#8208;TANC shows photo&#8208;induced dynamic helicity. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) and time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy demonstrate that chiral&#8208;TANC undergoes ultrafast relaxation accompanied by untwisting motions within 8&#160;ps upon photoexcitation, establishing the direct correlation between photo&#8208;induced conformational evolution and chiroptical dynamics in heteroatom&#8208;free, fully conjugated molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Two&#8208;Color Photochemical Polymer Network Formation and Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitches, able to respond to disparate wavelengths, are integrated into multi&#8208;functional polymer architectures to form a photoresist that responds to curing upon irradiation with two distinct monochromatic colors of light, enabling two&#8208;color lithography.








Abstract
We introduce synergistic two&#8208;color lithography as an advanced wavelength&#8208;gated strategy for spatially and temporally controlling polymer network formation. Our photoresist entails two photoswitches, i.e., diarylindenone epoxide (DIO) and strained azobenzene (SA), each activated at a judiciously selected wavelength, i.e., 375 or 430&#160;nm. Under specific conditions of photon flux, simultaneous irradiation at both wavelengths induces a (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#160;cycloaddition between the photoactivated DIO&#8242; and SA&#8242; species, generating covalently crosslinked networks, whereas under these specifically determined conditions, single&#8208;wavelength exposure does not induce solidification. Kinetic analysis highlights the potential of synergistic activation to enable advanced additive manufacturing. We implemented the two&#8208;color activated covalent bond forming system in a dual&#8208;laser lithographic platform enabling the fabrication of well&#8208;defined structures, including segmented ring and butterfly architectures by simply activating and deactivating one of the colors of light.

         <title>Lithium Iodide Enables Bis&#8208;electrophilic Ring&#8208;Opening of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium iodide&#8208;mediated electrophile&#8211;electrophile ring opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) furnishes densely substituted azetidines. Leveraging ABB ring strain under mild, base&#8208;free conditions, the method enables sequential electrophilic incorporation, displays broad scope and operational simplicity, and is amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization.








Abstract
Azetidines are privileged nitrogen heterocycles in medicinal chemistry; however, current synthetic methodologies utilizing azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) predominantly rely on classical nucleophile&#8211;electrophile or radical&#8208;based approaches. Here, we report an unprecedented electrophile&#8211;electrophile ring&#8208;opening strategy enabled by lithium iodide&#8208;mediated activation of ABBs, offering direct and versatile access to densely substituted azetidines through sequential electrophilic incorporation. This new reactivity exploits the inherent ring strain of ABBs under mild, base&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby eliminating the necessity for harsh reaction environments. Mechanistic studies and control experiments unequivocally establish the pivotal role of lithium iodide in ring&#8208;opening and generating an in situ enolate intermediate, facilitating efficient bisfunctionalization via electrophilic trapping. The operational simplicity, extensive substrate scope, and remarkable compatibility with late&#8208;stage functionalization significantly enhance the synthetic versatility and modularity of ABB&#8208;derived azetidines, presenting a powerful approach for rapidly assembling complex molecules containing azetidines.

         <title>Blue Organic Long Persistent Luminescence: A UV/Violet&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitable and Green/Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Erasable Donor&#8208;Sensitizer&#8208;Acceptor Organic Afterglow System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor strategy enables the first pure&#8208;blue organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL, &#955; &lt; 450&#160;nm) with hour&#8208;long afterglow, achieved via rationally designed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers. Mechanistic studies reveal a charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced pathway. Remarkably, OLPL can be optically erased by green/red light, offering write&#8208;erase capability for photonic storage and encryption.








Abstract
We pioneered a donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component system to devise organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials, where the afterglow color is solely determined by sensitizer's emission color. Here we report two major breakthroughs in the field of OLPL: 1) tailored fabrication of pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials and 2) a direct observation of OLPL erased by green/red lights. We rationally designed blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers by connecting biphenyl&#8208;containing group with suitable HOMO and T1 energy levels to difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate moiety based on the energy gap law and the El&#8208;Sayed rule. The resultant donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component materials exhibit pure&#8208;blue hour&#8208;long OLPL afterglow with &#955;OLPL &lt; 450&#160;nm; such pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials remain elusive in the reported studies. Mechanistic investigations confirm a unique charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced OLPL pathway, involving electron transfer processes between donor, sensitizer, and acceptor. The OLPL materials are UV/visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable. Remarkably, it is found that the OLPL emission can be erased by green or red light; the long&#8208;lived excited TADF sensitizers can be pushed by green/red lights to higher excited states, followed by fast nonradiative deactivation, enabling optical erasure.

&lt;p&gt;A donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor strategy enables the first pure-blue organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL, &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 450&#160;nm) with hour-long afterglow, achieved via rationally designed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers. Mechanistic studies reveal a charge-separation-induced pathway. Remarkably, OLPL can be optically erased by green/red light, offering write-erase capability for photonic storage and encryption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pioneered a donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three-component system to devise organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials, where the afterglow color is solely determined by sensitizer's emission color. Here we report two major breakthroughs in the field of OLPL: 1) tailored fabrication of pure-blue OLPL materials and 2) a direct observation of OLPL erased by green/red lights. We rationally designed blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers by connecting biphenyl-containing group with suitable HOMO and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; energy levels to difluoroboron &#946;-diketonate moiety based on the energy gap law and the El-Sayed rule. The resultant donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three-component materials exhibit pure-blue hour-long OLPL afterglow with &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OLPL&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 450&#160;nm; such pure-blue OLPL materials remain elusive in the reported studies. Mechanistic investigations confirm a unique charge-separation-induced OLPL pathway, involving electron transfer processes between donor, sensitizer, and acceptor. The OLPL materials are UV/visible-light-excitable. Remarkably, it is found that the OLPL emission can be erased by green or red light; the long-lived excited TADF sensitizers can be pushed by green/red lights to higher excited states, followed by fast nonradiative deactivation, enabling optical erasure. This unprecedented optical write&#8211;erase functionality, coupled with hour-long OLPL duration, would offer promising opportunities for rewritable photonic storage, encryption, and dynamic labeling applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Electron and Hole Transport by Pd Single Atoms and Gradient&#8208;Distributed Ti3+ Species for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Oxidation of CH4 to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiO2&#8208;based photocatalyst featuring atomically dispersed Pd and a gradient distribution of Ti3+ enables efficient photocatalytic oxidation of CH4 to liquid oxygenates at room temperature. Pd atoms enhance electron transfer and O2 activation, while Ti3+ promotes hole migration, thereby achieving a record C1 oxygenates yield with 91.3% selectivity through spatially separated charge carrier pathways.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates offers a sustainable strategy for utilizing natural gas and reducing carbon emissions. However, the efficiency of current photocatalysts remains limited by poor charge carrier utilization, particularly the ineffective migration of holes that are crucial for C&#9472;H bond activation. Herein, we report a rationally engineered TiO2 photocatalyst incorporating atomically dispersed Pd and a gradient distribution of Ti3+ species, achieving a remarkable C1 oxygenates yield of 8.14&#160;mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 91.3% selectivity at room temperature, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd single atoms accelerate electron transfer and facilitate O2 dissociation, while the gradient&#8208;distributed Ti3+ species promote hole migration from the bulk to the surface, enabling efficient CH4 activation. These spatially separated charge pathways synergistically promote the formation of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;OOH radicals, which couple to generate CH3OOH and subsequently convert into methanol and formaldehyde.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereospecific Glycosylation with Glycal Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed, highly stereospecific glycosylation method with glycal epoxides, which is effective for a broad range of substrates, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and glucuronic ester epoxide donors. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with hindered secondary acceptors. 








Abstract
Complex carbohydrates are essential to understanding life processes, but their synthesis is still challenging. In principle, complex glycans could be rapidly assembled via reiterative and stereospecific glycosylation with glycal epoxides. However, the existing stereospecific glycosylation methods with glycal epoxides are ineffective for the vast majority of secondary sugar acceptors, because they often induce irreversible glycal epoxide decomposition and concurrent SN1&#8208;type glycosylation, affording an inseparable mixture of diastereomeric glycosylation products in low yields. We report herein a new catalytic, highly stereospecific glycosylation method for glycal epoxides using readily available iron catalysts. This method is effective for a wide variety of glycal epoxides and glycosyl acceptors, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and electron&#8208;deficient glucuronic ester epoxides. It also facilitates the assembly of an array of biologically important glycosidic linkages that were previously difficult to obtain in high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with both primary and hindered secondary acceptors.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonyl&#8208;Locking Strategy for Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient, Narrowband Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first blue B/N/C&#9552;O hybrid multiple resonance emitters are developed by one&#8208;step carbonylation, exhibiting narrowband blue emissions peaking at 462 and 445 nm with full widths at half maximum of 16 and 18 nm in toluene, and high electroluminescent performance with external quantum efficiencies of 37.9% and 22.8%, together with the CIE coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.








Abstract
Efficient and narrowband blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are highly attractive for wide color gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, we strategically incorporate an electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl lock at the para&#8208;position of the nitrogen atom in the classical MR&#8208;TADF skeleton by a simple one&#8208;step carbonylation reaction with a high yield. Compared to the parent molecules, this design strategy not only reduces intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer intensity, leading to&#160;blue&#8208;shifted emission, but also effectively enhances molecular planarity and rigidity, thereby narrowing the emission spectra. As a result, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, namely CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA, are developed, with&#160;emission peaks at 462 and 445&#160;nm, and narrow the full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 16 and 18&#160;nm, respectively, representing the first blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR&#8208;TADF emitters. The sensitized OLEDs based on CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA achieve excellent blue electroluminescent performance, with the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values of 37.9% and 22.8%, along with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.

         <title>Observation of Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal and Photoacoustic Effects in a Metallosupramolecular Trefoil Knot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallosupramolecular trifold knot has been prepared from three bisimidazole ligands and three dinuclear half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes. The topology of the trifold knot enforces strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the building blocks, which results in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption. This leads to an efficient photothermal conversion and a remarkable photoacoustic (PA) response, while the trifold knot exhibits a high stability.








Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is a facile and powerful strategy for the construction of metallosupramolecular mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs). However, the limited stability of most MIMs constitutes a challenge with respect to the evaluation of their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a rational strategy to control the self&#8208;assembly outcome for selected metallosupramolecular structures. The reaction of a biphenyl&#8208;bridged bisimidazole ligand with dinuclear building blocks of varying lengths leads, depending on the size of the dinuclear building block, to a simple [1+1] metallacycle, a twisted [2+2] three&#8208;dimensional trapezoidal structure, or an intricate [3+3] metallosupramolecular trefoil knot. The trefoil knot exhibits exceptional structural stability, resisting decomposition upon dilution in polar solvent. Its knotted topology enforces strong intramolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions, which red&#8208;shift the absorption band into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. Benefiting from its stability and NIR absorption, the trefoil knot displays a high photothermal conversion efficiency (&#951;&#160;=&#160;73.5%) and a potent photoacoustic (PA) effect in water, even at low concentrations.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Ligand Regulation of Homogeneous Cation&#8211;Anion Distribution Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;ligands additives, PCH and PBD achieve homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distribution in perovskite films via coordinated Pb2&#8314;/FA&#8314; passivation and I&#8722; stabilization. This optimized uniformity enables vacuum&#8208;flashed PSCs with a record 26.66% PCE (certified 26.33%) and exceptional stability (&gt;90% efficiency retention after 1100&#160;h MPPT at 60&#160;&#176;C), highlighting ion homogeneity as key for high performance.








Abstract
While amidine ligands are known to significantly enhance defect passivation in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their role in modulating perovskite film homogeneity through coordinated control of cation&#8211;anion distributions remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that a dual&#8208;ligand strategy utilizing pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboximidamide hydrochloride (PCH) and pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboximidamide dihydrochloride (PBD) achieves homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distributions, enabling high&#8208;performance PSCs. Incorporated into the precursor solutions, these dual&#8208;ligand additives distribute uniformly throughout the perovskite bulk. By simultaneously utilizing their pyridine and amidine groups to passivate Pb2&#8314; and FA&#8314; ions, as well as employing hydrogen bonding to stabilize I&#8722; ions, the uniformity of anions and cations within the film is enhanced. Vacuum flash&#8208;assisted solution&#8208;processed PSCs incorporating PBD&#8208;passivated films with optimized homogeneity achieved a PCE of 26.66% (certified 26.33%). Notably, these devices retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1100 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under operational conditions (60&#160;&#176;C, N2 atmosphere). This PCE value ranks among the highest reported to date for perovskite solar cells. Our findings highlight that achieving homogeneous cation&#8208;anion distribution is essential for designing effective passivators, thereby simultaneously advancing both the PCE and operational stability of PSCs.

         <title>Direct Boron&#8208;10 Access: Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#9472;10B Coupling Utilizing 10BF3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C(sp2)&#9472;10B cross&#8208;coupling method was developed, utilizing commercially available 10BF3. This approach features a Lewis acid/base activation strategy to generate reactive borenium ions in situ. It enables the efficient synthesis of a wide range of 10B&#8208;enriched organoboron compounds, which hold significant potential for applications in boron neutron capture therapy drug development and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.








Abstract
The boron&#8208;10 isotope (10B) is critical for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT); however, the direct use of industrially available 10BF3 for synthesizing 10B&#8208;enriched compounds remains challenging due to the strong B&#9472;F bonds. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol that enables direct C(sp2)&#9472;10B bond formation using 10BF3. This approach employs AlCl3 and a Lewis base to generate electrophilic borenium ions in situ. The method eliminates the need for pre&#8208;functionalized boron reagents, providing an efficient route to diverse 10B&#8208;enriched compounds with promising applications in BNCT and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells by Fine&#8208;Tuning Molecular Crystallization and Film Formation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing efficient yet low&#8208;cost electron acceptors is imperative for widespread organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. Herein, a highly interconnected three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network packing and the optimized film formation kinetics of low&#8208;cost A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have been precisely manipulated via a facile side chain regulation, leading to both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and record&#8208;breaking figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) for OSCs. 








Abstract
Achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with low&#8208;cost active layer materials is of vital importance for organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. However, the PCEs afforded by currently reported low&#8208;cost electron acceptors remain substantially limited. Herein, we report the regulation of molecular crystallization and film formation kinetics of the low&#8208;cost electron acceptors with A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring structures and achieved an impressive PCE of 18.04% and a tiptop figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) of 0.363, representing the best&#8208;known values for OSCs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies indicate that the long and flexible side chain on the central core could hinder the unfavorable dimer formation of electron acceptors and lead to three&#8208;dimensional network packing, which is critical for exciton diffusion and charge transport. Moreover, the in situ optical spectroscopy revealed that the side chain elongation of the electron acceptor could slow the film formation kinetics of the small molecular acceptor while accelerating those of the polymer donor, which is conducive to forming bi&#8208;continuous interpenetrating fibril networks with better intermixing. This work demonstrates that low&#8208;cost, simple&#8208;structured fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors hold a bright future in the OSC commercialization.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH Heterostructure for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH composite has been successfully fabricated by an in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly interface engineering strategy, where the in situ anchoring of C4N on MgAl&#8208;LDH can broaden the material's light harvesting range, shorten charge transfer distance, and optimize the adsorption properties of reactants and intermediates, fostering an exceptional solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 performance and stability. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air offers a highly promising and sustainable strategy. However, the slow kinetics of water oxidation severely restricts the oxygen reduction half&#8208;reaction due to insufficient proton supply, leading to low efficiency of many H2O2 photocatalysts. Herein, we constructed an interface&#8208;engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH heterostructure via a straightforward in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly method. The resulting hybrid photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield rate of 2.38&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without cocatalysts and sacrificial agents, along with exceptional stability (&#8805;20 cycles). Its performance significantly surpasses those of bare MgAl&#8208;LDH, C4N, and their physically mixed counterpart. The zeta potential analysis confirms the formation of an intimately contacted interface with strong electronic coupling, enabling rapid charge transfer and prominent photocatalytic performances. Isotope tracing experiments employing H218O and 18O2 provide clear evidence for dual pathways of H2O2 formation involving both water and molecular oxygen. The incorporation of C4N not only extends visible&#8208;light absorption but also promotes the adsorption and activation of key reactants and intermediates. The synthetic approach developed here is simple, cost&#8208;effective, and broadly applicable, offering a feasible route for designing advanced photocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

This study optimized CuxAg10&#8722;x catalysts, exhibiting superior FOR performance. We revealed HCHO concentration&#8208;dependent deactivation caused by HCOO&#8722; accumulation, highlighting the importance of electrolyte optimization. Coupling FOR with CO2RR achieved dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production (0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0.5&#160;V. Furthermore, FOR's versatility was demonstrated by pairing with HER, NO3RR, and ORR to produce electricity and value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
Electrochemical formate (HCOO&#8722;) production via CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great promise for carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems; however, its practical implementation is significantly hindered by the high energy demand of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing OER with a more energetically and economically favorable alternative anodic reaction is therefore essential. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu&#8211;Ag catalyst for anodic formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). Systematic investigations employing in situ Raman spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical analyses revealed that Cu enables&#160;an earlier onset potential for FOR, and Ag enhances formaldehyde adsorption, leading to synergistically improved performance. The optimal Cu3Ag7 catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&#8722; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;VRHE. When coupled with CO2RR, the FOR||CO2RR system enabled dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production, achieving a total HCOO&#8722; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&#8722; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy&#8208;efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Step Synthesis of 613$6_1^3$ Link Cages by Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed, which allows for precise control over the cavity size of the resulting 613$6_1^3$ link cages by adjusting the dimensions of the building blocks.








Abstract
Among various [3]catenanes, 613$6_1^3$ link cages have yet to be synthesized due to the difficulty of their synthesis. To address this challenge, a synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and the precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed. By relying on the rational design of the dimensions and conformation self&#8208;adaptation of the linkers, four 613$6_1^3$ links and one Solomon link were synthesized by the assembly of curved dipyridyl ligands and half&#8208;sandwich rhodium/iridium(III) dinuclear fragments. Among the various structures mentioned, the metallo&#8208;cages with 613$6_1^3$ topology were synthesized with high selectivity when the length of the long arms featuring a dipyridyl ligand minus the length of the binuclear building block was approximately 7&#160;&#197;. Notably, this synthetic approach employing elongated dinuclear building blocks enabled the preparation of novel closed three&#8208;link chain cages with substantially expanded cavity dimensions compared with those of known analogues. Additionally, this construction strategy allows tuning of the cavity size of the resulting cages by modulating the dimensions of the building blocks.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and CPL Property of Inner&#8208;Wall Modified Pagoda[5]Arenes Driven by Cavity Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of inner&#8208;wall modified pagoda[5]arene (P5) derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions via highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions between P5 and the guests. These derivatives displayed the fixed conformation and stable chirality. Particularly, the neutral inner&#8208;wall modified P5 was resolved by HPLC and exhibited mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism and strong circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Macrocyclic arenes with large cavities and chirality are attractive in supramolecular chemistry, but fixing their conformation and obtaining stable chirality remain significant challenges. The method of rim functionalization with bulky groups often involves multiple reactive sites, leading to poor selectivity and efficiency. Herein, the inner&#8208;wall modification as a promising yet underexplored strategy for achieving fixed conformation and stable chirality of pagoda[5]arene (P5) was developed. Consequently, a series of inner&#8208;wall modified P5 derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions by the highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions of P5 with (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium)ethylene guests, enabled by the guest pre&#8208;organization in the cavity microenvironment of P5. In contrast, reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and the guests are not observed even at 170&#160;&#176;C due to the absence of the cavity microenvironment. Moreover, a neutral inner&#8208;wall modified derivative (P5py) was obtained by post&#8208;reaction demethylation. P5py exhibited stable planar chirality, and its enantiomers were efficiently resolved by chiral HPLC. Notably, the enantiomers showed mirror&#8208;imaged CD signals and strong CPL property. This work provides a new facile strategy for fixing the conformation and achieving the stable chirality of macrocyclic arenes with chiral large cavities, and thereby broadens their prospects for applications in supramolecular and materials chemistry.
