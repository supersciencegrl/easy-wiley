         <title>Copper pairing in the mordenite framework as a function of the Cu(I)/Cu(II) speciation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of gas&#8208;phase reactants is used to treat a Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite zeolite with the aim of studying the influence of the reaction environment on the formation of Cu pairs. The rearrangement of Cu ions to form multimeric sites as a function of their oxidation state was probed by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), also by applying advanced analysis through Wavelet Transform, a method able to specifically locate Cu&#8208;Cu interactions also in the presence of overlapping contributions from other scattering paths. The nature of the Cu&#8208;oxo species formed upon oxidation was further crosschecked by DFT&#8208;assisted fitting of the EXAFS data and by resonant Raman spectroscopy. Altogether, the Cu(I)/Cu(II) speciation clearly correlates with Cu proximity, with metal ion pairs quantitatively forming under an oxidative environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Effect on the Improved Sodium Storage Performance of N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of electrode material is correlated with the choice of electrolyte, however, how the solvation has significant impact on electrochemical behavior is underdeveloped. Herein, N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is investigated to reveal the solvation effect on the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries in different electrolyte environment. TAPQ cycled in diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. The function of solvation effect is mainly embodied in two aspects: one is the stabilization of anion intermediate via the compatibility of electrode and electrolyte, the other is the interfacial electrochemical characteristics influenced by solvation sheath structure. By revealing the failure mechanism, this work presents an avenue for better understanding electrochemical behavior and enhancing performance from the angle of solvation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Benzothiophene Synthesis via Enantiospecific Coupling of Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzothiophenes are valuable heterocycles that are widely used in medicines, agrochemicals, and materials science. Herein, we report a general method for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzothiophenes via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C2&#8208;alkylation of benzothiophenes with boronic esters. The reactions utilize benzothiophene  S  &#8208;oxides in lithiation&#8211;borylations to generate intermediate arylboronate complexes, and subsequent Tf  2  O&#8208;promoted S&#8722;O bond cleavage to trigger a Pummerer&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;metalate shift, which gives the coupled products with complete enantiospecificity. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl boronic esters and aryl boronic esters are successfully coupled with a range of C3&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes. Importantly, this transformation does not require the use of C3 directing groups, therefore it overcomes a major limitation of previously developed transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated C2 alkylations of benzothiophenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine and Its Discrete &#960;&#8208;Stacked Homochiral Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc phthalocyanine&#8208;[7]helicene hybrid molecular structure forms a discrete homochiral dimer and exhibits chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior also in a racemic mixture. The self&#8208;assembled dimeric structure shows remarkable stability in solution and the solid state, as well as effective electronic communication. The [7]helicene units induce an intense CD effect to the characteristic absorption band in the NIR region of phthalocyanine.







Abstract
In this communication, we demonstrate a novel approach to prepare a discrete dimer of chiral phthalocyanine (Pc) by exploiting the flexible molecular geometry of helicenes, which enables structural interlocking and strong aggregation tendency of Pcs. Synthesized [7]helicene&#8208;Pc hybrid molecular structure, zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine (Zn&#8208;7HPc), exclusively forms a stable dimeric pair consisting of two homochiral molecules. The dimerization constants were estimated to be as high as 8.96&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.42&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 in THF and DMSO, respectively, indicating remarkable stability of dimer. In addition, Zn&#8208;7HPc exhibited chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior, which resulted in preferential formation of a homochiral dimer also in the racemic sample. Two phthalocyanine subunits in the dimeric form strongly communicate with each other as revealed by a large comproportionation constant and observation of an IV&#8208;CT band for the thermodynamically stable mixed&#8208;valence state.

         <title>Designer Nanomaterials through Programmable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review discusses progress on principles and methods for creating nanoparticle&#8208;based materials via programmable self&#8208;assembly. We review the pathways by which DNA&#8208;based assembly has been used to impart organization to prescribed particles. DNA, as a programmable structural element, can be used to create designer nanomaterials from inorganic and organic nanoparticles of multiple types and functionalities.







Abstract
Nanoparticles have long been recognized for their unique properties, leading to exciting potential applications across optics, electronics, magnetism, and catalysis. These specific functions often require a designed organization of particles, which includes the type of order as well as placement and relative orientation of particles of the same or different kinds. DNA nanotechnology offers the ability to introduce highly addressable bonds, tailor particle interactions, and control the geometry of bindings motifs. Here, we discuss how developments in structural DNA nanotechnology have enabled greater control over 1D, 2D, and 3D particle organizations through programmable assembly. This Review focuses on how the use of DNA binding between nanocomponents and DNA structural motifs has progressively allowed the rational formation of prescribed particle organizations. We offer insight into how DNA&#8208;based motifs and elements can be further developed to control particle organizations and how particles and DNA can be integrated into nanoscale building blocks, so&#8208;called &#8220;material voxels&#8221;, to realize designer nanomaterials with desired functions.

         <title>Conformational Adaptation of &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers for the Formation of Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag+&#8208;coordination&#8208;mediated assembly of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers led to the formation of distinctive metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique interwoven topologies. Formation of the network structures was accompanied by unusual conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. These new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular foldamers may provide useful molecular platforms for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;coordinated frameworks derived from small peptidic ligands have received much attention thanks to peptides&#8217; vast structural and functional diversity. Various peptides with partial conformational preferences have been used to build metal&#8211;peptide frameworks, however, the use of conformationally constrained &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers has not been explored yet. Herein we report the first metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;mediated assembly of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers with 12&#8208;helical folding propensity. The coordination of Ag+ to the terminal pyridyl moieties afforded a set of metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique entangled topologies. Interestingly, formation of the network structures was accompanied by notable conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. As the first demonstration of new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers, we anticipate that this work will be an important benchmark for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.

     alt="Conformational Adaptation of &#946;-Peptide Foldamers for the Formation of Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination-mediated assembly of &#946;-peptide foldamers led to the formation of distinctive metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique interwoven topologies. Formation of the network structures was accompanied by unusual conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. These new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular foldamers may provide useful molecular platforms for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-coordinated frameworks derived from small peptidic ligands have received much attention thanks to peptides&#8217; vast structural and functional diversity. Various peptides with partial conformational preferences have been used to build metal&#8211;peptide frameworks, however, the use of conformationally constrained &#946;-peptide foldamers has not been explored yet. Herein we report the first metal-coordination-mediated assembly of &#946;-peptide foldamers with 12-helical folding propensity. The coordination of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the terminal pyridyl moieties afforded a set of metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique entangled topologies. Interestingly, formation of the network structures was accompanied by notable conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. As the first demonstration of new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular &#946;-peptide foldamers, we anticipate that this work will be an important benchmark for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxyenamides as Versatile Building Blocks for a Highly Stereoselective One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;Diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol&#8208;Scaffold Containing Three Continuous Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Oxyenamides are introduced as novel, highly versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol scaffold. A Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated reaction of 2&#8208;oxyenamides with acylimine precursors and a terminal nucleophile enables a modular assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol structure bearing three continuous stereocenters with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A highly diastereoselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;alcohol unit bearing three continuous stereocenters is described. This method utilizes 2&#8208;oxyenamides as a novel type of building block for the rapid assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamine scaffold containing an additional stereogenic oxygen functionality at the C2 position. A stereoselective preparation of the required (Z)&#8208;oxyenamides is reported as well.

         <title>Identification of RNA Base Pairs and Complete Assignment of Nucleobase Resonances by Proton&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy at 100&#8197;kHz MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed solid&#8208;state NMR experiments to detect base pair patterns in RNA. The experiments use high&#8208;sensitivity 1H&#8208;detection and allow site&#8208;specific assignment of base pairs to individual nucleotide spin&#8208;systems. In addition, the experiments yield full assignment of nucleobase resonances. The methodology is applicable to RNA embedded in particles of any size and provides rapid access to RNA secondary structure in biological complexes.







Abstract
Knowledge of RNA structure, either in isolation or in complex, is fundamental to understand the mechanism of cellular processes. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight complexes and does not require crystallization; thus, it is well&#8208;suited to study RNA as part of large multicomponent assemblies. Recently, we solved the first structures of both RNA and an RNA&#8208;protein complex by ssNMR using conventional 13C&#8208; and 15N&#8208;detection. This approach is limited by the severe overlap of the RNA peaks together with the low sensitivity of multidimensional experiments. Here, we overcome the limitations in sensitivity and resolution by using 1H&#8208;detection at fast MAS rates. We develop experiments that allow the identification of complete nucleobase spin&#8208;systems together with their site&#8208;specific base pair pattern using sub&#8208;milligram quantities of one uniformly labelled RNA sample. These experiments provide rapid access to RNA secondary structure by ssNMR in protein&#8208;RNA complexes of any size.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Coupling of Aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Esters with Polyfluoroaryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative coupling of aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents was achieved by dual photoredox and copper catalysis. This method allows the installation of alkyl groups on polyfluoroaryls with a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are an important class of compounds in medical and material chemistry. The synthesis of alkylated polyfluoroarenes remains challenging. Here we describe a decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents (Zn&#8208;ArF) via synergetic photoredox and copper catalysis. This method readily converts primary and secondary alkyl carboxylic acids into the corresponding polyfluoroaryl compounds, which could have a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns on the aryl groups. Broad scope and good functional group compatibility were achieved, including on substrates derived from natural products and pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic study revealed that a [Cu&#8208;(ArF)2] species could be responsible for the transfer of polyfluoroaryl groups to the alkyl radicals.

         <title>Construction of Function&#8208;Oriented Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsive Bacterial Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, core&#8211;shell heterostructures of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were fabricated via a stepwise ligand&#8208;grafting method. The UCNP &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation into visible ranges, which can further excite the HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; to achieve near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photothermal and photodynamic bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Exploration of effective ways to integrate various functional species into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is critically important for their applications but highly challenging. In this study, according to the &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; strategy, core&#8211;shell heterostructure of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and HOFs was fabricated for the first time via a ligand&#8208;grafting stepwise method. The UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (980&#8197;nm) into visible light (540&#8197;nm and 653&#8197;nm), which further excites the perylenediimide&#8208;based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR&#8208;responsive bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF&#8208;based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.

         <title>Isolable Geminal Bisgermenolates: A New Synthon in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient method to obtain geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (1&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (1&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (1&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents, is reported. Selected examples of electrophiles were used to display the efficiency of 1&#8201;a,b as new building in organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
We have synthesized the first isolable geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (2&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (2&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (2&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline (TH&#946;C) is not only a prevailing structural feature of many natural alkaloids but also a versatile synthetic precursor for a vast array of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. Asymmetric synthesis of C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs remains rarely explored and challenging. Herein, we describe the development of the two complementary approaches for the catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions with up to 96% yield and 99%  ee  . The utility of chiral C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs was demonstrated by the collective total syntheses of seven indole alkaloids: harmicine, eburnamonine, desethyleburnamonine, larutensine, geissoschizol, geissochizine, and akuammicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Propargyl Esters and Alkynylsilanes: Synthesis of Vinylallene Derivatives through a Twofold 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes under gold catalysis provides vinylallene derivatives through consecutive [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy/[1,2]&#8208;silyl rearrangements. Good yields, full atom&#8208;economy, broad substrate scope, easily scale&#8208;up and low catalyst loadings are salient features of this novel transformation. Density Functional Therory (DFT) calculations suggest a reaction mechanism involving initial [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy rearrangement to generate a gold vinylcarbene intermediate which upon regioselective attack of the alkynylsilane affords a vinyl cation which undergoes a type II&#8208;dyotropic rearrangement involving the silyl group and the metal fragment. Preliminary results on the enantioselective version of this transformation are also disclosed.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxy Radical&#8208;induced Formation of Dual&#8208;Layered Protection Film for High&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uncontrollable dendrite growth of Li metal anode leads to poor cycle stability and safety concerns, hindering its utilization in high energy density batteries. Herein, a phenoxy radical Spiro&#8208;O8 is proposed as an artificial protection film for Li metal anode owing to its excellent film&#8208;forming capability and remarkable ionic conductivity. A spontaneous redox reaction between the Spiro&#8208;O8 and Li metal results in the formation of a uniform and highly ionic conductive organic film in the bottom. Meanwhile, the phenoxy radicals on surface of Spiro&#8208;O8 facilitate the decomposition of Li salt upon exposed to the ether electrolyte and lead the formation of LiF film on the top. Arising from the synergistic effects of inner high ionic&#160;conductive film and outer rigid film, stable Li plating/stripping can be realized at a high current density (4000 cycles at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and a high areal capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8208;2  for 550 h with an ultrahigh Li utilization rate of 54.6%. As a proof of concept, this work shows a facile strategy to rationally fabricate dual&#8208;layered interfaces for Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition Mechanism of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Ketone&#8208;Based Inhibitors Unveiled by Multiscale Simulations.  Insights for Improved Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the results of classical and QM/MM simulations for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CL protease by a hydroxymethylketone inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231. In the noncovalent complex the carbonyl oxygen atom of the warhead is placed in the oxyanion hole formed by residues 143 to 145, while P1&#8208;P3 groups are accommodated in the active site with similar interactions to those observed for the peptide substrate. According to alchemical free energy calculations, the P1&#8217; hydroxymethyl group also contributes to the binding free energy. Covalent inhibition of the enzyme is triggered by the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the S&#947; atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1&#8217; hydroxyl group. Computational simulations show that the addition of a methylchloride substituent to the P1&#8217; group may lower the activation free energy for covalent inhibition.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor/acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>A cryptic plant terpene cyclase producing unconventional 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic C25 and C20 terpenoids with immunosuppressive activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A versatile terpene synthase (LcTPS2) producing unconventional macrocyclic terpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Engineered E. coli and Nicotiana benthamiana expressing LcTPS2 produced six 18&#8208;/14&#8208;membered sesterterpenoids including five new ones and two 14&#8208;membered diterpenoids, representing the first macrocyclic sesterterpenoids from plants and the largest sesterterpenoid ring system identified to date. Surprisingly, none of these macrocyclic terpenoids were detected in L. canum. Two variants F516A and F516G producing approximately 3.3&#8208; and 2.5&#8208; folds respectively more sesterterpenoids than the wild type enzyme was engineered. Both 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered ring sesterterpenoids displayed significant inhibitory activity on the IL&#8208;2 and IFN&#8208;&#947; production of T cells via inhibition of MAPK pathway. The findings will contribute to the development of efficient biocatalysts to create bioactive macrocyclic sesterterpenoids, and also herald a new potential in the well&#8208;trodden territory of plant terpenoid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>An Effective Strategy for Designing Nonlinear Optical Crystals by Combining the Structure&#8208;directing Property of Oxyfluorides with the Chemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rationally designing a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal remains a great ongoing challenge. It involves not only the design of noncentrosymmetric structures but also property optimization. In this communication, a new strategy for effectively designing the NLO crystal has been put forward,  i.e.  using the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluoride anions to obtain a noncentrosymmetric and polar structure, and then by substitution of IO  3  &#8208;  for isovalent F  &#8208;  anions to further enhance the SHG response. With this strategy, a new  iodate fluoride  , Ba  2  [MoO  3  F(IO  3  )](MoO  3  F  2  ) has been successfully designed from the Ba  2  (MoO  3  F  2  )F  2  with the  cis&#8208;  directing [MoO  4  F  2  ]  4&#8208;  groups. It exhibits a large SHG response  (  ~8 &#215; KDP), a wide transparent region (0.30&#8722;10.92 &#956;m), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT) (88.53 MW cm  &#8722;2  ), and a large birefringence (~0.264@532 nm). These indicate Ba  2  [MoO  3  F(IO  3  )](MoO  3  F  2  ) would be a promising NLO crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Interfacial Layer for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plating/stripping of Li dendrites can fracture the static solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cause significant dynamic volume variations in the Li anode, which give rise to poor cyclability and severe safety hazards. Herein, a tough polymer with a slide&#8208;ring structure was designed as a self&#8208;adaptive interfacial layer for Li anodes. The slide&#8208;ring polymer with a dynamically crosslinked network moves freely while maintaining its toughness and fracture resistance, which allows it can to dissipate the tension induced by Li dendrites on the interphase layer. Moreover, the slide&#8208;ring polymer is highly stretchable, elastic, and displays an ultrafast self&#8208;healing ability, which allows even pulverized Li to remain coalesced without disintegrating upon consecutive cycling. The Li anodes demonstrate greatly improved suppression of Li dendrite formation, as evidenced by the high critical current density (6 mA cm  &#8722;2  ) and stable cycling for the full cells with high&#8208;areal capacity LiFePO  4  , high&#8208;voltage NCM, and an S cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Polymer Nanocapsules via Redox Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer nanocapsules have demonstrated significant value in materials science and biomedical technology, but require complicated and time&#8208;consuming synthetic steps. We report here the facile synthesis of monodisperse polymer nanocapsules via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules: dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol (BDT). Specifically, BDT forms core templates and modulates the oxidation kinetics of dopamine into polydopamine (PDA) shells. These uniform nanoparticles can be tuned between ~70 and 200 nm because the core diameter directly depends on BDT while the shell thickness depends on dopamine. The supramolecular core can then rapidly disassemble in organic solvents to produce PDA nanocapsules. Such nanocapsules exhibit enhanced physicochemical performance (e.g., loading capacity, photothermal transduction, and anti&#8208;oxidation) versus their solid counterparts. Particularly, this method enables a straightforward encapsulation of functional nanoparticles providing opportunities for designing complex nanostructures such as yolk&#8211;shell nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Deformable Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While organic polymers are available as low&#8208;weight, affordable, flexible and available semiconductors, organic crystals remain relatively unexplored for the same purpose. Here, we report the first organic semiconductor crystal with a unique combination of properties and can be used as a multifunctional optoelectronic device. We demonstrate that mechanically flexible single crystals of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) can function as a phototransistor, photoswitch, and an optical waveguide. The material can exist as two structurally different solid phases, with single crystals of one of the phase being elastic at room temperature while those of the other are brittle and become plastic at higher temperature. The spectral sensitivity of a phototransistors based on BPEA crystals was studied under excitation from the visible to the near&#8208;IR region. The output and transfer characteristics of the devices were characterized by measuring the generation and temporal response of the switching of the photogenerated current. The current&#8211;voltage characteristics of both phases exhibit linearity and symmetry about the positive and negative voltages. Moreover, the crystals transmit light in the telecommunications range with significantly low optical loss for an organic crystalline material. The combination of optoelectronic properties in these mechanically compliant single crystals set the path to exploration of mechanically complaint organic single crystals as light&#8208;weight phototransistors, fiber&#8208;optic waveguides and filters for optical transduction of information.</dc:description>

         <title>Desulfonative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as powerful &#8220;click&#8221; electrophiles to access sulfonylated derivatives. Yet, they are otherwise relatively inert towards C &#8208; C bond forming transformations,&#160;&#160;notably under transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Here, we describe conditions under which aryl sulfonyl fluorides act as electrophiles for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This desulfonative cross&#8208;coupling occurs selectively in the absence of base and, unusually, even in the presence of strong acids. Divergent one&#8208;step syntheses of two analogues of bioactive compounds showcase the expanded reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides to encompass both S&#8208;Nu and C&#8208;C bond formation. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8208;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd&#8208;F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR spectroscopy of the main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and fragment&#8208;based screening identify three protein hotspots and an antiviral fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main protease (3CLp) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the causative agent for the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, is one of the main targets for drug development. To be active, 3CLp relies on a complex interplay between dimerization, active site flexibility, and allosteric regulation. The deciphering of these mechanisms is a crucial step to enable the search for inhibitors. In this context, using NMR spectroscopy, we studied the conformation of dimeric 3CLp from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and monitored ligand binding, based on NMR signal assignments. We performed a fragment&#8208;based screening that led to the identification of 38 fragment hits. Their binding sites showed three hotspots on 3CLp, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface. F01 is a non&#8208;covalent inhibitor of the 3CLp and has antiviral activity in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells. This study sheds light on the complex structure&#8208;function relationships of 3CLp, and constitutes a strong basis to assist in developing potent 3CLp inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Hindrance Drives the Boron&#8208;Initiated Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides to Photoluminescent C5&#8208;Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22469-22477, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new alkyl&#8208;substituted dienyltriphenylarsonium ylides was synthesized and used as monomers in the borane&#8208;initiated polymerization, achieving almost pure C5&#8208;polymer (95.8&#8201;%), with photoluminescent properties.







Abstract
A series of alkyl&#8208;subsituted dienyltriphenylarsonium ylides were synthesized and used as monomers in borane&#8208;initiated polymerization to obtain practically pure C5&#8208;polymers (main&#8208;chain grows by five carbon atoms at a time). The impact of triethylborane (Et3B), tributylborane (Bu3B), tri&#8208;sec&#8208;butylborane (s&#8208;Bu3B), and triphenylborane (Ph3B) initiators on C5 polymerization was studied. Based on NMR and SEC results, we have shown that all synthesized polymers have C5 units with a unique unsaturated backbone where two conjugated double bonds are separated by one methylene. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers possess predictable molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn,NMR=2.8 &#8722;11.9&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#208;=1.04&#8211;1.24). It has been found that increasing the steric hindrance of both the monomer and the initiator can facilitate the formation of more C5 repeating units, thus driving the polymerization to almost pure C5&#8208;polymer (up to 95.8&#8201;%). The polymerization mechanism was studied by 11B&#8197;NMR and confirmed by DFT calculations. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers are amorphous with tunable glass&#8208;transition temperatures by adjusting the substituents of monomers, ranging from +30.1&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;38.4&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, they possess blue photoluminescence that changes to yellow illuminating the polymers for 5&#8197;days with UV radiation of 365&#8197;nm (IIE, isomerization induced emission).

         <title>Superatom&#8208;in&#8208;Superatom [RhH@Ag24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22293-22300, October 4, 2021. </description>

The superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom concept was demonstrated for the first time. A rhodium hydride (RhH) superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom [RhH@Ag24(SR)18]2&#8722; nanocluster. The Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) could be incorporated into the Ag24(SR)18 framework by forming the RhH superatom resembling the closed d&#8208;shell Pd atom ([Kr]4d10).







Abstract
Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d&#8208;shells, the doping of open d&#8208;shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) is incorporated into the Ag24 framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d10). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag24 framework was co&#8208;doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster with the superatomic 8&#8208;electron configuration (1S21P6). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanocluster.

         <title>Chalcogenides by Reduction of their Dioxides in Ultra&#8208;Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22570-22577, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpected reduction of selenium(IV) and tellurium(IV) oxides to chalcogenides was achieved under ultra&#8208;alkaline conditions by using As2O3 as reducing agent. By optimization of the reaction conditions, large crystals of K2Se3, K2Te3 and K2Se2Te were grown within two days. In the latter compound, the novel mixed chalcogenide anion (SeTe)2&#8722; was discovered.







Abstract
The reaction of chalcogen dioxides ChO2 (Ch=Se, Te) with As2O3 in a 30&#8197;molar KOH hydroflux at about 200&#8201;&#176;C yielded crystals of potassium trichalcogenides K2Ch3 with dimensions up to 2&#8197;cm. Arsenic trioxide acts as electron donor and is oxidized to arsenate(V). The new heterochalcogenide anion (TeSe2)2&#8722; formed when starting from SeO2 and TeO2 simultaneously. The compound K2TeSe2 crystallizes isostructural to K2S3 and K2Se3. The unexpected redox reaction as well as the precipitation of hygroscopic compounds from an aqueous solution are attributed to a strongly reduced activity of water. The reactions were studied by Raman and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Depending on the concentration of As2O3, colorless monochalcogenide Ch2&#8722; or orange Se22&#8722; and purple Te22&#8722; anions are dominating the solutions.

3D single&#8208;particle&#8208;tracking microscopy combined with a lock&#8208;in filtering algorithm for the quantitative observation of individual protein&#8211;nanoparticle (NP) interactions without surface immobilization is presented. This highly sensitive method, which can be applied in various protein&#8211;NP systems, gives insight into in&#8197;situ protein corona on a per&#8208;particle basis and provides the possibility to study transient protein&#8211;NP interactions.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when exposed to biological fluids, forming a dynamic protein corona that affects their fate in biological environments. A comprehensive understanding of the protein corona is lacking due to the inability of current techniques to precisely measure the full corona in&#8197;situ at the single&#8208;particle level. Herein, we introduce a 3D real&#8208;time single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy to &#8220;lock&#8208;on&#8221; to single freely diffusing polystyrene NPs and probe their individual protein coronas, primarily using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model system. The fluorescence signals and diffusive motions of the tracked NPs enable quantification of the &#8220;hard corona&#8221; using mean&#8208;squared displacement analysis. Critically, this method's particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle nature enabled a lock&#8208;in&#8208;type frequency filtering approach to extract the full protein corona, despite the typically confounding effect of high background signal from unbound proteins. From these results, the dynamic in&#8197;situ full protein corona is observed to contain twice the number of proteins compared to the ex&#8197;situ&#8208;measured &#8220;hard&#8221; protein corona.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization by Hydromagnesiation: A Modular Strategy Towards N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22345-22351, October 4, 2021. </description>

An iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylanilides to prepare a variety of N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. The reaction, which usually occurs at room temperature over a short reaction time, employs an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron catalyst and EtMgBr as a hydride source. The breadth of this strategy was demonstrated by the synthesis of densely substituted indoles, oxindoles and novel tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolones, as well as the application towards the formal syntheses of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
A reductive cyclization to prepare a variety of N&#8208;heterocycles, through the use of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides, is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron complex and generally occurs at ambient temperature. The transformation likely proceeds through hydromagnesiation of the vinyl group, and trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated benzylic anion by an intramolecular electrophile to form the heterocycle. This iron&#8208;catalyzed strategy was shown to be broadly applicable and was utilized in the synthesis of substituted indoles, oxindoles and tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolone derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicated that the reversibility of the hydride transfer step depends on the reactivity of the tethered electrophile. The synthetic utility of our approach was further demonstrated by the formal synthesis of a reported bioactive compound and a family of natural products.

         <title>Base&#8208;Activated Latent Heteroaromatic Sulfinates as Nucleophilic Coupling Partners in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22461-22468, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Next&#8208;generation, base&#8208;activated latent sulfinate reagents have been successfully developed for use in the construction of heteroaromatic frameworks, such as 2&#8208;arylpyridines. Under Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions, these species unmask to give the sulfinate in situ, which then undergoes efficient desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with an array of (hetero)aryl halides.







Abstract
Heteroaromatic sulfinates are effective nucleophilic reagents in Pd0&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl halides. However, metal sulfinate salts can be challenging to purify, solubilize in reaction media, and are not tolerant to multi&#8208;step transformations. Here we introduce base&#8208;activated, latent sulfinate reagents: &#946;&#8208;nitrile and &#946;&#8208;ester sulfones. We show that under the cross&#8208;coupling conditions, these species generate the sulfinate salt in situ, which then undergo efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl bromides to deliver a broad range of biaryls. These latent sulfinate reagents have proven to be stable through multi&#8208;step substrate elaboration, and amenable to scale&#8208;up.

         <title>Photodriven Elimination of Chlorine From Germanium and Platinum in a Dinuclear PtII&#8594;GeIV Complex</title>

A novel platinum dichloride complex supported by an ambiphilic bisphosphinodichlorogermane ligand photo&#8208;isomerizes into a tetravalent platinum trichloride germyl complex. Further irradiation of this new complex triggers the elimination of chlorine and the formation of a covalent Pt&#8211;Ge bond. Transient absorption spectroscopy points to the intermediacy of a charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the nascent chlorine atom and the aromatic ligand.







Abstract
Searching for a connection between the two&#8208;electron redox behavior of Group&#8208;14 elements and their possible use as platforms for the photoreductive elimination of chlorine, we have studied the photochemistry of [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2GeIVCl2]PtIICl2 and [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2ClGeIII]PtIIICl3, two newly isolated isomeric complexes. These studies show that, in the presence of a chlorine trap, both isomers convert cleanly into the platinum germyl complex [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2ClGeIII]PtICl with quantum yields of 1.7&#8201;% and 3.2&#8201;% for the GeIV&#8211;PtII and GeIII&#8211;PtIII isomers, respectively. Conversion of the GeIV&#8211;PtII isomer into the platinum germyl complex is a rare example of a light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal/main&#8208;group&#8208;element bond&#8208;forming process. Finally, transient&#8208;absorption&#8208;spectroscopy studies carried out on the GeIII&#8211;PtIII isomer point to a ligand arene&#8211;Cl. charge&#8208;transfer complex as an intermediate.

The complex achieves a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. In vivo studies reveal the great potential of the complex in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.







Abstract
Small organic photothermal agents (SOPTAs) that absorb in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window are highly desirable in photothermal therapy for their good biocompatibility and deeper tissue penetration. However, the design of NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that molecular engineering of BF2 complex via strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor conjugation and increasing the intramolecular motions is an efficient strategy to achieve NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs with high photothermal performance. Based on this strategy, a BF2 complex, BAF4, was designed and synthesized. BAF4 exhibits an intense absorption maximum at 1000&#8197;nm and negligible fluorescence. Notably, the nanoparticles of BAF4 achieve a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation (0.75&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In vitro and in vivo studies reveal the great potential of BAF4 nanoparticles in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Discrete Heteropolynuclear Yb/Er Assemblies: Switching on Molecular Upconversion Under Mild Conditions</title>

The performance of discrete heteropolynuclear Yb/Er salts is switched from a Yb/Er doublet to competitive upconversion luminescence exploiting fluoride association. A more than 20&#8208;fold enhancement of the relative quantum yield &#981;UC under low power densities in non&#8208;deuterated solvents at room temperature was recorded.







Abstract
The salts {[Ln2Ln*(Hhmq)3(OAc)3(hfac)2]+ [Ln*(hfac)3(OAc)(MeOH)]&#8722;} (Hhmq=2&#8208;methanolquinolin&#8208;8&#8208;oxide, hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate; Ln, Ln*=Er, Gd, Yb) feature a discrete heteronuclear cation consisting of two types of lanthanide atoms. The quinolinoxy O&#8208;atom serves as a &#956;2&#8208;bridge to two Ln atoms and as a &#956;3&#8208;bridge to all three atoms, with metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal distances being around 3.7&#8197;&#197;. For 1 ([Yb2Er]+), near&#8208;infrared downshifted luminescence is switched to competitive upconversion luminescence upon irradiation by a 980&#8197;nm laser under an extremely low excitation power (0.288 W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) through introduction of fluoride ions. The stability of 1 after addition of fluoride was confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and multistage mass spectrometry, associated with the 1H&#8197;NMR of 6 ([La2Eu]+). More importantly, the at least 20&#8208;fold enhancement of the quantum yield in non&#8208;deuterated solvents at room temperature under low power densities (2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is the highest among the few molecular examples reported.

         <title>18.77&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Promoted by Aqueous Solution Processed Cobalt(II) Acetate Hole Transporting Layer</title>

A robust hole transporting layer based on cobalt(II) acetate was developed by aqueous solution processing technology, low temperature thermal annealing and UV&#8208;ozone treatment, which enabled a record high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 18.77&#8201;% of binary blend organic solar cells.







Abstract
A robust hole transporting layer (HTL), using the cost&#8208;effective Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O) as the precursor, was simply processed from its aqueous solution followed by thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments. The TA treatment induced the loss of crystal water followed by oxidization of Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O precursor, which increased the work function. However, TA treatment differently realize a high work function and ideal morphology for charge extraction. The resulting problems could be circumvented easily by additional UVO treatment, which also enhanced the conductivity and lowered the resistance for charge transport. The optimal condition was found to be a low temperature TA (150&#8201;&#176;C) followed by simple UVO, where the crystal water in Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O was removed fully and the HTL surface was anchored by substantial hydroxy groups. Using PM6 as the polymer donor and L8&#8208;BO as the electron acceptor, a record high PCE of 18.77&#8201;% of the binary blend OSCs was achieved, higher than the common PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based solar cell devices (18.02&#8201;%).

The chemical structures of fragments that are composed of CMS strands from varied polyimide precursors are similar, however, the texture or morphology structure is greatly affected by precursors, determining CMS membrane separation performance. The CMS properties can be tuned via controlling the strand&#8242;s structure, thereafter the plate and cellular structures, by designing precursor polymer chemical structure and pyrolysis conditions.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes have impressive separation properties; however, both chemical and morphology structures need to be understood better. Here we characterize CMS with the simplest polyimide (PI) PMDA/pPDA (PMDA=pyromellitic dianhydride, pPDA=p&#8208;phenylenediamine), using FTIR, solid&#8208;state 15N&#8208;NMR and 13C&#8208;NMR, XPS, XRD, and Raman spectra to study chemical structure. We also compare gas separation properties for this CMS to a CMS derived from a more conventional PI precursor. The detailed characterization shows the presence of aromatic pyridinic, pyrrolic rings as well as graphitic, pyridonic components and a few other groups in both CMS types derived from the very different precursors. The CMS morphologies, while related to precursor and pyrolysis temperature details, show similarities consistent with a physical picture comprising distributed molecular sieving plate&#8208;like structures. These results assist in understanding diverse CMS membrane separation performance.

         <title>A Congruent&#8208;Melting Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Vanadate Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22447-22453, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to the elusive mid&#8208;infrared by direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) enabled by a vanadate crystal is reported. Cs4V8O22 exhibits a wide transparent range, a strong SHG response, a large laser damage threshold and congruent&#8208;melting behavior. Quantum mechanical calculations demonstrate the key role played by its quasi&#8208;rigid layered structure in the improvement in linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical performance.







Abstract
Study of mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is hindered by the competing requirements of optimized second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient dij and laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT) as well as the harsh synthetic conditions. Herein, we report facile hydrothermal synthesis of a polar NLO vanadate Cs4V8O22 (CVO) featuring a quasi&#8208;rigid honeycomb&#8208;layered structure with [VO4] and [VO5] polyhedra aligned parallel. CVO possesses a wide IR&#8208;transparent window, high LIDT, and congruent&#8208;melting behavior. It has very strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG intensities in metal vanadate family (12.0 &#215; KDP @ 1064&#8197;nm and 2.2 &#215; AGS @ 2100&#8197;nm). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the exceptional SHG responses of CVO largely originate from virtual electronic transitions within [V4O11]&#8734; layer; the excellent optical transmittance of CVO arises from the special characteristics of vibrational phonons resulting from the layered structure.

     alt="A Congruent-Melting Mid-Infrared Nonlinear Optical Vanadate Exhibiting Strong Second-Harmonic Generation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to the elusive mid-infrared by direct second-harmonic generation (SHG) enabled by a vanadate crystal is reported. Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a wide transparent range, a strong SHG response, a large laser damage threshold and congruent-melting behavior. Quantum mechanical calculations demonstrate the key role played by its quasi-rigid layered structure in the improvement in linear and second-order nonlinear optical performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study of mid-infrared (mid-IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is hindered by the competing requirements of optimized second-harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient d&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; and laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) as well as the harsh synthetic conditions. Herein, we report facile hydrothermal synthesis of a polar NLO vanadate Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; (CVO) featuring a quasi-rigid honeycomb-layered structure with [VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] and [VO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] polyhedra aligned parallel. CVO possesses a wide IR-transparent window, high LIDT, and congruent-melting behavior. It has very strong phase-matchable SHG intensities in metal vanadate family (12.0 &#215; KDP @ 1064&#8197;nm and 2.2 &#215; AGS @ 2100&#8197;nm). First-principles calculations suggest that the exceptional SHG responses of CVO largely originate from virtual electronic transitions within [V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; layer; the excellent optical transmittance of CVO arises from the special characteristics of vibrational phonons resulting from the layered structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Functionalization of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks to Achieve an Exceptionally High Iodine&#8208;Capture Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22432-22440, October 4, 2021. </description>

Multivariate covalent organic frameworks provide an ideal platform for ionic functionalization, enabling the integration of large surface areas, high pore volumes, and abundant binding sites, thereby leading to unprecedented levels of I2&#8208;capture performance under both static and dynamic adsorption conditions.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based iodine (I2) capture has great potential for the treatment of radioactive nuclear waste. In this study, we apply a &#8220;multivariate&#8221; synthetic strategy to construct ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a large surface area, high pore volume, and abundant binding sites for I2 capture. The optimized material iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 exhibits a static I2 uptake capacity of 10.21&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C and a dynamic uptake capacity of 2.79&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8776;400&#8197;ppm I2 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, far exceeding the performances of previously reported adsorbents under similar conditions. iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 also exhibits fast adsorption kinetics, good moisture tolerance, and full reusability. The promoting effect of ionic groups on I2 adsorption has been elucidated by experimentally identifying the iodine species adsorbed at different sites and calculating their binding energies. This work demonstrates the essential role of balancing the textural properties and binding sites of the adsorbent in achieving a high I2 capture performance.

         <title>Rapid Access to Ordered Mesoporous Carbons for Chemical Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22478-22486, October 4, 2021. </description>

Nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered porous carbon was synthesized by microwave heating using Fe3O4 nanoparticles as hard templates. The microwave&#8208;assisted method reduces the reaction time and provides highly ordered structure with large surface area and nitrogen doping. NaAlH4 was confined into the pores of the carbon scaffold and the hydrogen sorption kinetics is improved by the synergistic effects of nanoconfinement and nitrogen doping.







Abstract
Ordered mesoporous carbon materials offer robust network of organized pores for energy storage and catalysis applications, but suffer from time&#8208;consuming and intricate preparations hindering their widespread use. Here we report a new and rapid synthetic route for a N&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous carbon structure through a preferential heating of iron oxide nanoparticles by microwaves. A nanoporous covalent organic polymer is first formed in situ covering the hard templates of assembled nanoparticles, paving the way for a long&#8208;range order in a carbonaceous nanocomposite precursor. Upon removal of the template, a well&#8208;defined cubic mesoporous carbon structure was revealed. The ordered mesoporous carbon was used in solid state hydrogen storage as a host scaffold for NaAlH4, where remarkable improvement in hydrogen desorption kinetics was observed. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lowest activation energy of dehydrogenation as a single step was attributed to their ordered pore structure and N&#8208;doping effect.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as Molecular Sieve for Highly Selective Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene on Isolated Single Pd Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22522-22528, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation is realized using a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework supported single Pd atom catalyst by creating dynamic confinement regions which preferentially adsorb acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and release the produced ethylene. This catalyst combines the advantages of MOFs for gas separation and single atomic sites for catalysis.







Abstract
Achieving highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation in an ethylene&#8208;rich gas stream is of great industrial importance. Herein, we construct isolated single Pd atom in a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (POMOF). The unique internal environment allows this POMOF to separate acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and confine it close to the single Pd atom. After semi&#8208;hydrogenation, the resulting ethylene is preferentially discharged from the pores, achieving a selectivity of 92.6&#8201;%. First&#8208;principles simulations reveal that the adsorbed acetylene/ethylene molecules form hydrogen bond networks with oxygen atoms of SiW12O404&#8722; and create dynamic confinement regions, which preferentially release the produced ethylene. Besides, at the Pd site, the over&#8208;hydrogenation of ethylene exhibits a higher reaction energy barrier than the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined advantages of POMOF and single Pd atom provides an effective approach for the regulation of semi&#8208;hydrogenation selectivity.

We report the synthesis of the first example of a molecular compound featuring a Li&#8722;Al bond and a systematic analysis of the bonding in this and related Mg and Zn systems through structural, quantum&#8208;chemical, and reactivity probes.







Abstract
Synthetic routes to lithium, magnesium, and zinc aluminyl complexes are reported, allowing for the first structural characterization of an unsupported lithium&#8211;aluminium bond. Crystallographic and quantum&#8208;chemical studies are consistent with the presence of a highly polar Li&#8722;Al interaction, characterized by a low bond order and relatively little charge transfer from Al to Li. Comparison with magnesium and zinc aluminyl systems reveals changes to both the M&#8722;Al bond and the (NON)Al fragment (where NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene), consistent with a more covalent character, with the latter complex being shown to react with CO2 via a pathway that implies that the zinc centre acts as the nucleophilic partner.

         <title>Feedback and Communication in Active Hydrogel Spheres with pH Fronts: Facile Approaches to Grow Soft Hydrogel Structures</title>

pH fronts are generated from feedback&#8208;controlled reaction networks encapsulated in hydrogel spheres. The pH front/reaction diffusion chemistry is utilized to understand the systems such as membrane activity and inter&#8208;sphere communication. Further, its potential to develop smart self&#8208;growing materials as 2D and 3D hydrogel structures is showcased as an alternative to 3D printing tool.







Abstract
Compartmentalized reaction networks regulating signal processing, communication and pattern formation are central to living systems. Towards achieving life&#8208;like materials, we compartmentalized urea&#8208;urease and more complex urea&#8208;urease/ester&#8208;esterase pH&#8208;feedback reaction networks into hydrogel spheres and investigate how fuel&#8208;driven pH fronts can be sent out from these spheres and regulated by internal reaction networks. Membrane characteristics are installed by covering urease spheres with responsive hydrogel shells. We then encapsulate the two networks (urea&#8208;urease and ester&#8208;esterase) separately into different hydrogel spheres to devise communication, pattern formation and attraction. Moreover, these pH fronts and patterns can be used for self&#8208;growing hydrogels, and for developing complex geometries from non&#8208;injectable hydrogels without 3D printing tools. This study opens possibilities for compartmentalized feedback reactions and their use in next generation materials fabrication.

         <title>Restriction of Intramolecular Vibration in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens: Applications in Multifunctional Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Butterfly&#8208;like oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine molecules exhibit typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics through restriction of intramolecular vibrations. When used as ligands for the construction of MOFs, AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with multiple luminescence properties are produced.







Abstract
Butterfly&#8208;like molecules of oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine (OAP) are reported, which exhibit the typical characteristics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. Unlike any of the reported RIV&#8208;type AIE molecules, the synthetic procedures of which are complicated and have associated high costs, OAP AIEgens can be synthesized in a facile manner by a one&#8208;step catalyst&#8208;free reaction using commercially available materials. Notably, OAP AIEgens are ideal ligands for constructing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their built&#8208;in pyrazine coordination sites. OAP&#8208;based MOFs exhibit multiple potential applications in reversible gas response, encrypted information storage, and construction of white light&#8208;emitting devices. This work builds on RIV&#8208;type AIEgens, offers additional selections of bridging ligands for constructing luminescent MOFs and provides a visualized prototype to understand the effect of the RIV process on the luminescence properties of MOFs.

Powerful combination of experimental methods and calculations highlights the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying stereoselective [4+2] cycloadditions catalyzed by a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds. Our proposed mechanism would open a new window on the enzymatic [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
Enzymes catalyzing [4+2] cycloaddition have attracted increasing attention because of their key roles in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we solved the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular [4+2] cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds during biosynthesis of the HIV&#8208;1 integrase inhibitor equisetin and its stereochemical opposite, phomasetin. Computational modeling, using molecular dynamics simulations as well as quantum chemical calculations, demonstrates that the reactions proceed through synergetic conformational constraints assuring transition state&#8208;like substrates folds and their stabilization by specific protein&#8208;substrate interactions. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments verified the binding models. Intriguingly, the flexibility of bound substrates is largely different in two enzymes, suggesting the distinctive mechanism of dynamics regulation behind these stereoselective reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism herein deepens the basic understanding how these enzymes work but also provides a guiding principle to create artificial enzymes.

Self&#8208;bending organic single crystals of coronene with controlled width, length, and curvature are constructed for customized electronic micro&#8208;devices. The bending crystal device presents a huge improvement beyond seven orders of magnitude in the conductivity over the straight one, which benefited from both &#960; electron level changing and carrier mobility enhancement caused by the structural deformation in the bent regions.







Abstract
Electronic microdevices of self&#8208;bending coronene crystals are developed to reveal an unexplored link between mechanical deformation and crystal function. First, a facile approach towards length/width/curvature&#8208;controllable micro&#8208;crystals through bottom&#8208;up solution crystallization was proposed for high processability and stability. The bending crystal devices show a significant increase beyond seven orders of magnitude in conductivity than the straight ones, providing the first example of deformation&#8208;induced function enhancement in crystal materials. Besides, double effects caused by bending, including the change of &#960; electron level as well as the enhancement of carrier mobility, were determined, respectively by the X&#8208;ray photoelectric spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography to coexist, contributing to the conductivity improvement. Our findings will promote future creation of flexible organic crystal systems with deformation&#8208;enhanced functional features towards customized smart devices.

         <title>Activity Trends and Mechanisms in Peroxymonosulfate&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Production of Singlet Oxygen over Atomic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts</title>

A series of carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with similar structural and physicochemical properties were synthesized to uncover the activity trends and mechanisms in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;assisted reactive oxygen species production. Fe&#8208;SAC displays the best single&#8208;site kinetic value (1.65&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and the PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;1O2 is the most reasonable 1O2 reaction pathway.







Abstract
We synthesized a series of carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts (M&#8208;SACs: M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) with similar structural and physicochemical properties to uncover their catalytic activity trends and mechanisms. The peroxymonosulfate (PMS) catalytic activity trends are Fe&#8208;SAC&gt;Co&#8208;SAC&gt;Mn&#8208;SAC&gt;Ni&#8208;SAC&gt;Cu&#8208;SAC, and Fe&#8208;SAC displays the best single&#8208;site kinetic value (1.65&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1) compared to the other metal&#8208;N&#8208;C species. First&#8208;principles calculations indicate that the most reasonable reaction pathway for 1O2 production is PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;1O2; M&#8208;SACs that exhibit moderate and near&#8208;average Gibbs free energies in each reaction step have a better catalytic activity, which is the key for the outstanding performance of Fe&#8208;SACs. This study gives the atomic&#8208;scale understanding of fundamental catalytic trends and mechanisms of PMS&#8208;assisted reactive oxygen species production via M&#8208;SACs, thus providing guidance for developing M&#8208;SACs for catalytic organic pollutant degradation.

First-principles calculations indicate that the most reasonable reaction pathway for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; M-SACs that exhibit moderate and near-average Gibbs free energies in each reaction step have a better catalytic activity, which is the key for the outstanding performance of Fe-SACs. This study gives the atomic-scale understanding of fundamental catalytic trends and mechanisms of PMS-assisted reactive oxygen species production via M-SACs, thus providing guidance for developing M-SACs for catalytic organic pollutant degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Carbonylation to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Piperidones via Selective Cleavage of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Triple Bonds</title>

A catalytic carbonylative cleavage of carbon&#8211;carbon triple bonds is achieved. This allows for a general and direct synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated piperidones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation of alkynols.







Abstract
A direct and selective synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated piperidones by a new palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation is described. In the presented protocol, easily available propargylic alcohols react with aliphatic amines to provide a broad variety of interesting heterocycles. Key to the success of this transformation is a remarkable catalytic cleavage of the present carbon&#8211;carbon triple bond by using a specific catalyst with 2&#8208;diphenylphosphinopyridine as ligand and appropriate reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments revealed branched unsaturated acid 11 as crucial intermediate.

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Domino Reaction Enables Fully Controlled Non&#8208;Statistical Synthesis of Hexaarylbenzene with Six Different Aryl Groups**

A high yielding and scalable metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step linear domino reaction results in functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB) and opens the door for making a broad variety of synthetically challenging hexaarylbenzene (HAB) molecules with six different aryl groups.







Abstract
Hexaarylbenzene (HAB) derivatives are versatile aromatic systems playing a significant role as chromophores, liquid crystalline materials, molecular receptors, molecular&#8208;scale devices, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and candidates for organic electronics. Statistical synthesis of simple symmetrical HABs is known via cyclotrimerization or Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. By contrast, the synthesis of more complex, asymmetrical systems, and without involvement of statistical steps, remains an unsolved problem. Here we present a generally applicable synthetic strategy to access asymmetrical HAB via an atom&#8208;economical and high&#8208;yielding metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step domino reaction using nitrostyrenes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins as easily available starting materials. Resulting domino product&#8212;functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB)&#8212;can be used as a key starting compound to furnish asymmetrically substituted hexaarylbenzenes in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps. This straightforward domino process represents a distinct approach to create diverse and still unexplored HAB scaffolds, containing six different aromatic rings around central benzene core.

         <title>O&#8208;to&#8208;S Substitution Enables Dovetailing Conflicting Cyclizability, Polymerizability, and Recyclability: Dithiolactone vs. Dilactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22547-22553, October 4, 2021. </description>

Dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstocks show appealing chemical properties, including accelerated ring closure and polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity. The derived polymers constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight, atactic yet high crystallinity, structural diversity, and chemical recyclability.







Abstract
Developing chemically recyclable polymers represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration and offers a closed&#8208;loop strategy toward a circular materials economy. However, the synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers is still plagued with certain fundamental limitations, including trade&#8208;offs between the monomer's cyclizability and polymerizability, as well as between polymer's depolymerizability and properties. Here we describe the subtle O&#8208;to&#8208;S substitution, dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstock &#945;&#8208;amino acids can demonstrate appealing chemical properties different from those of dilactone, including accelerated ring closure, augmented kinetics polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity, and thus constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight (up to 100.5&#8197;kDa), atactic yet high crystallinity, structurally diversity, and chemical recyclability. These polythioesters well addresses the formidable challenges of developing chemically recyclable polymers by having an unusual set of desired properties, including easy&#8208;to&#8208;make monomer from ubiquitous feedstock, and high polymerizability, crystallinity and precise tunability of physicochemical performance, as well as high depolymerizability and selectivity. Computational studies explain why O&#8208;to&#8208;S modification of polymer backbone enables dovetailing desirable, but conflicting, performance into one polymer structure.

         <title>A Family of Heterobimetallic Cubes Shows Spin&#8208;Crossover Behaviour Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22562-22569, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple building blocks, six heterobimetallic cubes were obtained, following a straight&#8208;forward subcomponent self&#8208;assembly strategy. Three iron(II) based cages showed spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The crossover temperature was strongly dependent on interchangeable aldehyde components, giving rise to an efficient toolkit to manipulate magnetic behaviour.







Abstract
Using 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)aniline as a simple organic building block in combination with three different aldehyde components together with metal(II) salts gave three different Fe8Pt6&#8208;cubes and their corresponding Zn8Pt6 analogues by employing the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly approach. Whereas the use of zinc(II) salts gave rise to diamagnetic cages, iron(II) salts yielded metallosupramolecular cages that show spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The spin&#8208;transition temperature T1/2 depends on the incorporated aldehyde component, giving a construction kit for the deliberate synthesis of spin&#8208;crossover compounds with tailored transition properties. Incorporation of 4&#8208;thiazolecarbaldehyde or N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazole&#8208;carbaldehyde yielded cages that undergo spin&#8208;crossover around room temperature whereas the cage obtained using 1H&#8208;4&#8208;imidazolecarbaldehyde shows a spin&#8208;transition at low temperatures. Three new structures were characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and all structures were characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Regio&#8208;controllable Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation/Hydroboration of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22454-22460, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;controllable sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of alkynes has been developed with complete control of all the possible regioselectivities for the double addition processes (up to &gt;20/1 rr for all the cases). Various silylboronate regioisomers can be efficiently obtained from the same materials, with good functional group tolerance, regioselectivities as well as atom and pot economy.







Abstract
Regiodivergent addition reactions provide straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approaches to access different regioisomers. However, the regio&#8208;chemistry control to access all the possible results is still challenging especially for the reaction involving multiple addition steps. Herein, we reported regio&#8208;controllable cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylacetylenes, delivering all the possible regio&#8208;outcomes with high regioselectivities (up to &gt;20/1 rr for all the cases). Each regioisomer of value&#8208;added silylboronates could be efficiently and regioselectively obtained from the same materials. The adjustment of the ligands of cobalt catalysts combined with dual catalysis relay strategy is the key to achieve regio&#8208;chemistry control. This regio&#8208;controllable research might inspire the exploration of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis that involves multiple additions and provide full sets of regioisomers of other synthetic useful molecules.

&lt;p&gt;A cobalt-catalyzed regio-controllable sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of alkynes has been developed with complete control of all the possible regioselectivities for the double addition processes (up to &amp;gt;20/1 &lt;i&gt;rr&lt;/i&gt; for all the cases). Various silylboronate regioisomers can be efficiently obtained from the same materials, with good functional group tolerance, regioselectivities as well as atom and pot economy.

         <title>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22505-22512, October 4, 2021. </description>

Dynamic constitutional frameworks are expressed in the presence of bacteria templating from dynamic covalent libraries made of aromatic cores, PEGylated connectors, and ionic heads. These templated DCFs further translate into the multivalent presentation of cationic heads, subsequently promoting antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.







Abstract
Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCFs) were synthesized and screened for biofilm inhibition or disruption. They are composed of a trialdehyde core reversibly linked to a diamine PEG connector and to a variety of neutral, anionic, or cationic heads, to generate a library of DCFs to generate multivalent dendritic architectures in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The best DCFs were always polycationic and the nature of the cationic heads significantly impact the antibiofilm activity. The best antibiofilm activity was observed for DCF3B, displaying a polyethyleneimine head. A simple inactive guanidinium functional head strongly inhibited biofilm growth when assayed as a multivalent DCF3C. Using a more advanced in vitro biofilm model of chronic wound infection, DCF3C was found significantly superior than all other DCFs. These results demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of DCFs as low cost and efficient systems for antibiofilm disruption.

         <title>Tetrapyrrolic Pigments from Heme&#8208; and Chlorophyll Breakdown are Actin&#8208;Targeting Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
The physiological role of the degradation products of chlorophyll and heme, exogenous phyllobilins and endogenous bilins, respectively, remained an unsolved mystery for decades. We describe the influence of these tetrapyrroles on the actin cytoskeleton and introduce G&#8208;actin as the first human target protein for phyllobilins and a novel target for bilins. This study opens up a new perspective of the importance of these ubiquitous natural products.







Abstract
Chlorophyll and heme are among the &#8220;pigments of life&#8221;, tetrapyrrolic structures, without which life on Earth would not be possible. Their catabolites, the phyllobilins and the bilins, respectively, share not only structural features, but also a similar story: Long considered waste products of detoxification processes, important bioactivities for both classes have now been demonstrated. For phyllobilins, however, research on physiological roles is sparse. Here, we introduce actin, the major component of the cytoskeleton, as the first discovered target of phyllobilins and as a novel target of bilins. We demonstrate the inhibition of actin dynamics in vitro and effects on actin and related processes in cancer cells. A direct interaction with G&#8208;actin is shown by in silico studies and confirmed by affinity chromatography. Our findings open a new chapter in bioactivities of tetrapyrroles&#8212;especially phyllobilins&#8212;for which they form the basis for broad implications in plant science, ecology, and physiology.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions of Palladium&#8211;TiO2 Determined by In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22339-22344, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) of well&#8208;defined Pd&#8208;TiO2 catalysts under high&#8208;temperature oxidation was studied via in&#8197;situ atmospheric pressure TEM. On the different facets of TiO2 supports there were significant differences in the encapsulation behaviors with a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI. Obvious cover layers were observed on Pd&#8197;NPs supported on TiO2 (101) and (100) facets, while no such phenomenon appeared on TiO2 (001) facets.







Abstract
The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely used in supported metal catalysts and extensive studies have been performed to understand it. Although considerable progress has been achieved, the surface structure of the support, as an important influencing factor, is usually ignored. We report a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI of Pd&#8208;TiO2 in oxygen by using in&#8197;situ atmospheric pressure TEM. Pd NPs supported on TiO2 (101) and (100) surfaces showed encapsulation. In contrast, no such cover layer was observed in Pd&#8208;TiO2 (001) catalyst under the same conditions. This facet&#8208;dependent SMSI, which originates from the variable surface structure of the support, was demonstrated in a probe reaction of methane combustion catalyzed by Pd&#8208;TiO2. Our discovery of the oxidative facet&#8208;dependent SMSI gives direct evidence of the important role of the support surface structure in SMSI and provides a new way to tune the interaction between metal NPs and the support as well as catalytic activity.

         <title>Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22332-22338, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of designing a crosslink of superposed fast and slow dynamics, we show the quantitative control of the association/dissociation rate constants of this crosslink over 5 orders of magnitude. With this crosslink, we achieved precise control over viscoelasticity and mechanical response of polymer networks.







Abstract
Depending on the dynamics of the crosslinks, polymer networks can have distinct bulk mechanical behaviors, from viscous liquids to tough solids. Here, by means of designing a crosslink with variable molecular dynamics, we show the control of viscoelasticity of polymer networks in a broad range quantitatively. The hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline@cucurbit[7]uril (HIQ@CB[7]) crosslink exhibits in a combination of protonated and deprotonated states of similar association affinity but distinct molecular dynamics. The molecular property of this crosslink is contributed by linear combination of the parameters at the two states, which is precisely tuned by pH. Using this crosslink, we achieve the quantitative control of viscoelasticity of quasi&#8208;ideal networks in 5 orders of magnitude, and we show the reversible control of mechanical response, such as stiffness, strength and extensibility, of tough random polymer networks. This strategy offers a way to tailor the mechanical properties of polymer networks at the molecular level and paves the way for engineering &#8220;smart&#8221; responsive materials.

         <title>Controlling Coagulation in Blood with Red Light</title>

An engineered aptamer with a Cy7&#8208;based photocleavable linker can be used as anticoagulant. With tissue&#8208;penetrating red light, the aptamer is cleaved, and blood clotting is restored in human whole blood.







Abstract
Precise control of blood clotting and rapid reversal of anticoagulation are essential in many clinical situations. We were successful in modifying a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer with a red&#8208;light photocleavable linker derived from Cy7 by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Click chemistry. We were able to show that we can successfully deactivate the modified aptamer with red light (660&#8197;nm) even in human blood&#8212;restoring the blood's natural coagulation capability.

         <title>Radical Trifluoroacetylation of Alkenes Triggered by a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted C&#8211;O Bond Fragmentation of Trifluoroacetic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22487-22495, October 4, 2021. </description>

The trifluoroacyl radical is generated by C&#8722;O bond fragmentation of trifluoroacetic anhydride under photoredox conditions and undergoes olefinic C&#8722;H bond trifluoroacetylation in a mechanistically unique fashion. The protocol is operationally simple, scalable, and enables the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex biorelevant molecules delivering the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones in one step.







Abstract
We report a mild and operationally simple trifluoroacylation strategy of olefines, that utilizes trifluoroacetic anhydride as a low&#8208;cost and readily available reagent. This light&#8208;mediated process is fundamentally different from conventional methodologies and occurs through a trifluoroacyl radical mechanism promoted by a photocatalyst, which triggers a C&#8722;O bond fragmentation. Mechanistic studies (kinetic isotope effects, spectroelectrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, theoretical investigations) highlight the evidence of a fleeting CF3CO radical under photoredox conditions. The trifluoroacyl radical can be stabilized under CO atmosphere, delivering the trifluoroacetylation product with higher chemical efficiency. Furthermore, the method can be turned into a trifluoromethylation protocol by simply changing the reaction parameters. Beyond simple alkenes, this method allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of small&#8208;molecule drugs and common pharmacophores.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Encapsulation of Protein into Nanoscale Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Intracellular Biocatalysis</title>

The in situ encapsulation of protein by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) enables the formation of nanoscale protein@TA&#8208;HOFs under mild conditions. Moreover, this strategy is generally applicable to proteins with different surface charge and molecular weight, facilitating the cellular internalization of proteins for efficient enzyme catalysis inside living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous materials with great potential for biological applications. The self&#8208;assembly of HOFs and biomacromolecules, however, is challenging. We report herein the self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale HOFs (nHOFs) to encapsulate protein for intracellular biocatalysis. The self&#8208;assembly of tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane and azobenzenedicarboxylate can encapsulate protein in situ to form protein@nHOFs under mild conditions. This strategy is applicable to proteins with different surface charge and molecular weight, showing a high protein encapsulation efficiency and minimal effect on protein activity. A cellular delivery study shows that the protein@TA&#8208;HOFs can efficiently enter cells and retain enzyme activity for biochemical catalysis in living cells for neuroprotection. Our strategy paves new avenues for interfacing nHOFs with biological settings and sheds light on expanding nHOFs as a platform for biomacromolecule delivery and disease treatment.

         <title>Ordered Conformation&#8208;Regulated Vesicular Membrane Permeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22529-22536, October 4, 2021. </description>

Synthetic polypeptide vesicles can regulate their membrane permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations. Particularly, a transformation from extended &#946;&#8208;strands to compact &#945;&#8208;helices in response to reactive oxygen species reduces the vesicular wall thickness and remodels the membrane structure, thereby enhancing the membrane permeability for efficient nanoreaction, glucose&#8208;triggered insulin secretion and effective therapy of diabetes mellitus.







Abstract
In nature, the folding and conformation of proteins can control the cell or organelle membrane permeability and regulate the life activities. Here we report the first example of synthetic polypeptide vesicles that regulate their permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations, in a manner similar to biological systems. The polymersomes undergo a &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to wall thinning without loss of vesicular integrity. The change of membrane structure increases the vesicular permeability and enables specific transport of payloads with different molecular weights. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the polymersomes encapsulating enzymes could serve as nanoreactors and carries for glucose&#8208;stimulated insulin secretion in vivo inspired by human glucokinase, resulting in safe and effective treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in mouse models. This study will help understand the biology of biomembranes and facilitate the engineering of nanoplatforms for biomimicry, biosensing, and controlled delivery applications.

         <title>A Tale of Two Isomers: Enhanced Antiaromaticity/Diradical Character versus Deleterious Ring&#8208;Opening of Benzofuran&#8208;fused s&#8208;Indacenes and Dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalenes</title>

Fusion of benzofuran to either s&#8208;indacene or dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene results in two dramatically different outcomes depending upon heterocycle orientation. Whereas the &#8220;anti&#8221; isomers are unstable and hydrolyze readily to ring&#8208;opened products, the &#8220;syn&#8221; isomers are quite stable and afford molecules that either possess a high degree of antiaromaticity or exhibit pronounced diradical character.







Abstract
We examine the effects of fusing two benzofurans to s&#8208;indacene (indacenodibenzofurans, IDBFs) and dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene (indenoindenodibenzofurans, IIDBFs) to control the strong antiaromaticity and diradical character of these core units. Synthesis via 3&#8208;functionalized benzofuran yields syn&#8208;IDBF and syn&#8208;IIDBF. syn&#8208;IDBF possesses a high degree of paratropicity, exceeding that of the parent hydrocarbon, which in turn results in strong diradical character for syn&#8208;IIDBF. In the case of the anti&#8208;isomers, synthesized via 2&#8208;substituted benzofurans, these effects are decreased; however, both derivatives undergo an unexpected ring&#8208;opening reaction during the final dearomatization step. All the results are compared to the benzothiophene&#8208;fused analogues and show that the increased electronegativity of oxygen in the syn&#8208;fused derivatives leads to enhancement of the antiaromatic core causing greater paratropicity. For syn&#8208;IIDBF increased diradical character results from rearomati&#8208;zation of the core naphthalene unit in order to relieve this paratropicity.

         <title>Tertiary Chiral Nanostructures from C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F Directed Assembly of Chiroptical Superatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22411-22416, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tertiary chiral nanostructures have been created by assembling chiroptical superatoms of [Au7Ag6Cu2(S&#8208; or R&#8208;BINAP)3(SCH2Ph)6]+ (BINAP=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl). Both metal framework (primary structure) and surface ligands (secondary) of the nanocluster display perfect mirror symmetry. C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding between the clusters and SbF6&#8722; counterions direct formation of left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helices.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and structure of tertiary chiral nanostructures with 100&#8201;% optical purity. A novel synthetic strategy, using chiral reducing agent, R and S&#8208;BINAPCuBH4 (BINAP is 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl), is developed to access to atomically precise, intrinsically chiral [Au7Ag6Cu2(R&#8208; or S&#8208;BINAP)3(SCH2Ph)6]SbF6 nanoclusters in one&#8208;pot synthesis. The clusters represent the first tri&#8208;metallic superatoms with inherent chirality and fair stability. Both metal distribution (primary) and ligand arrangement (secondary) of the enantiomers exhibited perfect mirror images, and unprecedentedly, the self&#8208;assembly driven by the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction between the phenyl groups of the superatom moieties and SbF6&#8722; anions induced the formation of bio&#8208;mimic left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helices, achieving the tertiary chiral nanostructures. DFT calculations revealed the connections between the molecular details and chiral optical activity.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Coronoid with Hybrid Chichibabin&#8211;Schlenk Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22496-22504, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expanded, 18&#8208;ring coronoid molecule, inspired by the structures of Chichibabin and Schlenk hydrocarbons, features a cross&#8208;over of Kekul&#233; and non&#8208;Kekul&#233; conjugation, resulting in a distinct hexaradicaloid character, easy accessibility of high&#8208;spin states, and redox amphoterism.







Abstract
A hexaradicaloid molecule with alternating Kekul&#233; and non&#8208;Kekul&#233; connectivities between adjacent spin centers was obtained by fusing two conjugation motifs in Chichibabin and Schlenk hydrocarbons into a coronoid structure. 1H&#8197;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments and computational analyses show that the system has a singlet ground state with a significant hexaradicaloid character (&#947;0=0.826, &#947;1=&#947;2=0.773). It has multiple thermally accessible high&#8208;spin states (up to the septet), with uniform energy gaps of ca 1.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between consecutive multiplicities. In line with its open&#8208;shell character, the coronoid has a small electronic band gap (ca. 0.8&#8197;eV) and undergoes two consecutive one&#8208;electron oxidations at low potentials, yielding cationic forms with extended near&#8208;infrared absorption. The hexaradicaloid, which combines open&#8208;shell and macrocyclic contributions to its &#960; conjugation, is an example of a design strategy for multistate spin switches and redox&#8208;amphoteric NIR dyes.

         <title>Back Cover: Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22588-22588, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular crosslink of superposed fast and slow dynamics is reported by Hao Chen, Yi Cao, Yebang Tan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;22332. This crosslink exhibits quantitatively tailored molecular dynamics. The well&#8208;defined molecular dynamics of the crosslinks enable precise control over the viscoelasticity and mechanical response of the resulting polymer networks at the molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A supramolecular crosslink&lt;/b&gt; of superposed fast and slow dynamics is reported by Hao Chen, Yi Cao, Yebang Tan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on p&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202105112"&gt;age&#8197;22332&lt;/a&gt;. This crosslink exhibits quantitatively tailored molecular dynamics. The well-defined molecular dynamics of the crosslinks enable precise control over the viscoelasticity and mechanical response of the resulting polymer networks at the molecular level.

A linear hydrocarbon chain containing a diene and a dienophile is folded and transformed into a decalin scaffold by intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition. The substrates are folded oppositely but bind in the same orientation to the pockets of a pair of Diels&#8211;Alderases to yield enantiomeric decalin skeletons, as reported by Naoki Kato, Shunji Takahashi, Shingo Nagano, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;22401.

A high&#8208;speed 3D microscope has been developed to quantify the nanoparticle protein corona at the single&#8208;particle level. As presented by Xiaochen Tan and Kevin Welsher in their Research Article on page&#8197;22359, the microscope can &#8220;lock on&#8221; to freely diffusing nanoparticles to quantify the tightly bound &#8220;hard&#8221; and dynamic &#8220;soft&#8221; corona layers. This method can analyze single nanoparticles in the presence of significant protein background signals, opening the possibility for quantifying the protein corona in&#8197;vivo.

Hexaarylbenzene scaffolds , containing six different aromatic rings around the central benzene core, are a synthetic challenge. In their Research Article on page&#8197;22307, Svetlana&#8197;B. Tsogoeva et&#8197;al. report a process that allows the simple and straightforward generation of such hexaarylbenzenes (HABs). In an efficient, two&#8208;component four&#8208;step domino reaction, a functionalized triarylbenzene is formed and used as a key intermediate to furnish asymmetrically substituted HABs in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps.

         <title>Inorganic Synthesis Based on Reactions of Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents can intentionally be exploited as a synthetic tool to prepare inorganic materials that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional synthetic routes. This Review summarizes recent developments in inorganic syntheses that take advantage of reactions with ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents.







Abstract
Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are of growing interest as solvents for the resource&#8208;efficient synthesis of inorganic materials. This Review covers chemical reactions of various deep eutectic solvents and types of ionic liquids, including metal&#8208;containing ionic liquids, [BF4]&#8722;&#8208; or [PF6]&#8722;&#8208;based ionic liquids, basic ionic liquids, and chalcogen&#8208;containing ionic liquids. Cases in which cations, anions, or both are incorporated into the final products are also included. The purpose of this Review is to raise caution about the chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents and to establish a guide for their proper use.

&lt;p&gt;The chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents can intentionally be exploited as a synthetic tool to prepare inorganic materials that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional synthetic routes. This Review summarizes recent developments in inorganic syntheses that take advantage of reactions with ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are of growing interest as solvents for the resource-efficient synthesis of inorganic materials. This Review covers chemical reactions of various deep eutectic solvents and types of ionic liquids, including metal-containing ionic liquids, [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;- or [PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-based ionic liquids, basic ionic liquids, and chalcogen-containing ionic liquids. Cases in which cations, anions, or both are incorporated into the final products are also included. The purpose of this Review is to raise caution about the chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents and to establish a guide for their proper use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Clinical Technologies for Hyperpolarized 129Xenon Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22126-22147, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of hyperpolarized 129Xe has the potential to revolutionize clinical imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing contrast of organ function complementary to that of CT imaging and conventional MRI. In this Review, the physics of spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) is discussed, production modalities of hyperpolarized 129Xe are explained, and biomedical applications to lung imaging and beyond are described.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization is a technique that can increase nuclear spin polarization with the corresponding gains in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by 4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude. When this process is applied to biologically relevant samples, the hyperpolarized molecules can be used as exogenous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. A technique called spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) can be applied to hyperpolarize noble gases such as 129Xe. Techniques based on hyperpolarized 129Xe are poised to revolutionize clinical lung imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing, high&#8208;contrast alternative to computed tomography (CT) imaging and conventional proton MRI. Moreover, CT and conventional proton MRI report on lung tissue structure but provide little functional information. On the other hand, when a subject breathes hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, functional lung images reporting on lung ventilation, perfusion and diffusion with 3D readout can be obtained in seconds. In this Review, the physics of SEOP is discussed and the different production modalities are explained in the context of their clinical application. We also briefly compare SEOP to other hyperpolarization methods and conclude this paper with the outlook for biomedical applications of hyperpolarized 129Xe to lung imaging and beyond.

         <title>Enantioselective Lactonization by &#960;&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution: A Complement to &#960;&#8208;Allylmetal Chemistry</title>

A highly enantioselective lactonization of unactivated allylic alcohols is reported under mild conditions. The transformation is catalyzed by a PdII&#8901;StackPhos complex and facilitates the substitution of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product without selectivity issues arising from racemization.







Abstract
Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a powerful method for the formation of highly useful, non&#8208;racemic allylic compounds. Here we present a complementary enantioselective process that generates allylic lactones via &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. More specifically, a catalytic enantioselective dehydrative lactonization of allylic alcohols using a novel PdII&#8208;catalyst containing the imidazole&#8208;based P,N&#8208;ligand (S)&#8208;StackPhos is reported. The high&#8208;yielding reactions are operationally simple to perform with enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. This strategy facilitates the replacement of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product avoiding complications arising from racemization by equilibration.

Two photoresponsive olefin polymerization systems were rationally designed. Light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties.







Abstract
In this contribution, we install an azobenzene functionality in olefin polymerization catalysts and use light to modulate their properties via photoinduced trans&#8211;cis isomerization of the azobenzene moiety. The initially targeted azobenzene&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium and nickel catalysts are not photoresponsive. To address this issue, an imine&#8211;amine system bearing interrupted conjugation with the metal center, and a sandwich&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diimine system bearing an azobenzene unit at a position covalently far from the metal center were prepared and studied. We demonstrate that light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties. More interestingly, the light&#8208;mediated property changes were attributed to ligand electronic effects in one system and ligand steric effects in the other.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Excited Multicolor Afterglow in Carbon Dots&#8208;Based Room&#8208;Temperature Afterglow Materials</title>

A universal method is developed to activate near&#8208;infrared&#8208;excited multicolor afterglow of carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs) through radiative energy transfer from NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion materials (UMs). The resulting UM/CDAMs demonstrate bright and persistent afterglow from blue to orange under NIR CW laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature afterglow (RTA) materials with long lifetime have shown tremendous application prospects in many fields. However, there is no general design strategy to construct near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;excited multicolor RTA materials. Herein, we report a universal approach based on the efficient radiative energy transfer that supports the reabsorption from upconversion materials (UMs) to carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs). Thus, the afterglow emission (blue, cyan, green, and orange) of various CDAMs can be activated by UMs under the NIR continuous&#8208;wave laser excitation. The efficient radiative energy transfer ensured the persistent multicolor afterglow up to 7&#8197;s, 6&#8197;s, 5&#8197;s, and 0.5&#8197;s by naked eyes, respectively. Given the unusual afterglow properties, we demonstrated preliminary applications in fingerprint recognition and information security. This work provides a new avenue for the activation of NIR&#8208;excited afterglow in CDAMs and will greatly expand the applications of RTA materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature afterglow (RTA) materials with long lifetime have shown tremendous application prospects in many fields. However, there is no general design strategy to construct near-infrared (NIR)-excited multicolor RTA materials. Herein, we report a universal approach based on the efficient radiative energy transfer that supports the reabsorption from upconversion materials (UMs) to carbon dots-based RTA materials (CDAMs). Thus, the afterglow emission (blue, cyan, green, and orange) of various CDAMs can be activated by UMs under the NIR continuous-wave laser excitation. The efficient radiative energy transfer ensured the persistent multicolor afterglow up to 7&#8197;s, 6&#8197;s, 5&#8197;s, and 0.5&#8197;s by naked eyes, respectively. Given the unusual afterglow properties, we demonstrated preliminary applications in fingerprint recognition and information security. This work provides a new avenue for the activation of NIR-excited afterglow in CDAMs and will greatly expand the applications of RTA materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Darzens&#8208;Type Epoxidation of Diazoesters: Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Epoxides</title>

Chiral trisubstituted epoxides were synthesized by boron&#8211;Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The developed reaction provides an efficient synthetic route to various chiral compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone, and epoxy diester.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters with glyoxal derivatives was accomplished using a chiral boron&#8211;Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitated asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy esters. In the presence of a chiral oxazaborolidinium ion catalyst, the reaction proceeded in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20:1 dr, respectively). The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by conversion of the products to various compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone and epoxy diester.

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation by Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Aluminyls</title>

It turns out there is nothing special about potassium after all: Sodium and lithium metal reduce AlIII iodide precursors to the M2[Al(NONDipp)]2 aluminyls (M=Li, Na). Addition of Et2O afforded the monomeric ion pairs (NONDipp)Al&#8208;M(Et2O)2 containing unsupported Al&#8722;Li and Al&#8722;Na bonds. All species activate dihydrogen, albeit at significantly different rates of reaction.







Abstract
To date, aluminyl anions have been exclusively isolated as their potassium salts. We report herein the synthesis of the lithium and sodium aluminyls, M2[Al(NONDipp)]2 (M=Li, Na. NONDipp=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Both compounds crystallize from non&#8208;coordinating solvent as &#8220;slipped&#8221; contacted dimeric pairs with strong M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;(aryl) interactions. Isolation from Et2O solution affords the monomeric ion pairs (NONDipp)Al&#8208;M(Et2O)2, which contain discrete Al&#8722;Li and Al&#8722;Na bonds. The ability of the full series of Li, Na and K aluminyls to activate dihydrogen is reported.

We report on a first demonstration for a catalyst comprising metal NPs and amorphous MOF in a gas&#8208;phase reaction. Cu/amorphous UiO&#8208;66 exhibited 3&#8208;fold catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over Cu/crystalline UiO&#8208;66. Amorphous UiO&#8208;66 coating on Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites showed 1.5&#8208;fold catalytic activity enhancement over that of Cu/amorphous UiO&#8208;66.







Abstract
We report on Cu/amUiO&#8208;66, a composite made of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and amorphous [Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6] (amUiO&#8208;66, BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), and Cu&#8208;ZnO/amUiO&#8208;66 made of Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites and amUiO&#8208;66. Both structures were obtained via a spray&#8208;drying method and characterized using high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectra, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The catalytic activity of Cu/amUiO&#8208;66 for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was 3&#8208;fold that of Cu/crystalline UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, Cu&#8208;ZnO/amUiO&#8208;66 enhanced the methanol production rate by 1.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu/amUiO&#8208;66 and 2.5&#8208;fold compared with &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;supported Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites (Cu&#8208;ZnO/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3) as the representative hydrogenation catalyst. The high catalytic performance was investigated using in situ Fourier transform IR spectra. This is a first report of a catalyst comprising metal NPs and an amorphous metal&#8211;organic framework in a gas&#8208;phase reaction.

         <title>N&#947;&#8208;Hydroxyasparagine: A Multifunctional Unnatural Amino Acid That is a Good P1 Substrate of Asparaginyl Peptide Ligases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22207-22211, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unnatural amino acid, Asn(OH), mimics P1&#8208;Asn in the substrates of asparaginyl ligases, enabling efficient cyclization of P1&#8208;Asn(OH) peptides. The hydroxamic acid functionality in Asn(OH) is a metal&#8208;ion chelator for metalloenzyme inhibition, and Asn(OH) can be converted into native Asp by periodate oxidation (see scheme).







Abstract
Peptidyl asparaginyl ligases (PALs) are powerful tools for peptide macrocyclization. Herein, we report that a derivative of Asn, namely N&#947;&#8208;hydroxyasparagine or Asn(OH), is an unnatural P1 substrate of PALs. By Asn(OH)&#8208;mediated cyclization, we prepared cyclic peptides as new matrix metalloproteinase&#8197;2 (MMP2) inhibitors displaying the hydroxamic acid moiety of Asn(OH) as the key pharmacophore. The most potent cyclic peptide (Ki=2.8&#177;0.5&#8197;nM) was built on the hyperstable tetracyclic scaffold of rhesus theta defensin&#8208;1. The Asn(OH) residue in the cyclized peptides can also be readily oxidized to Asp. By this approach, we synthesized several bioactive Asp&#8208;containing cyclic peptides (MCoTI&#8208;II, kB2, SFTI, and integrin&#8208;targeting RGD peptides) that are otherwise difficult targets for PAL&#8208;catalyzed cyclization owing to unfavorable kinetics of the P1&#8208;Asp substrates. This study demonstrates that substrate engineering is a useful strategy to expand the application of PAL ligation in the synthesis of therapeutic cyclic peptides.

This study demonstrates that substrate engineering is a useful strategy to expand the application of PAL ligation in the synthesis of therapeutic cyclic peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Lamellar MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/PSS Composite Membrane for Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22265-22269, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar MXene (Ti3C2Tx)@PSS membranes with specific size exclusion and Li+ identification property show excellent mono/multi&#8208;valent ions separation performance. Compared with the traditional 2D membranes, the selectivity of Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Mg2+ through such membranes is five to ten times improved.







Abstract
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) laminar membrane with Li+ selective transport channels is obtained by stacking MXene nanosheets with the introduction of poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrene sulfonate) (PSS) with active sulfonate sites, which exhibits excellent Li+ selectivity from ionic mixture solutions of Na+, K+, and Mg2+. The Li+ permeation rate through the MXene@PSS composite membrane is as high as 0.08&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, while the Li+/Mg2+, Li+/Na+, and Li+/K+ selectivities are 28, 15.5, and 12.7, respectively. Combining the simulation and experimental results, we further confirm that the highly selective rapid transport of partially dehydrated Li+ within subnanochannels can be attributed to the precisely controlled interlayer spacing and the relatively weaker ion&#8208;terminal (&#8722;SO3&#8722;) interaction. This study deepens the understanding of ion&#8208;selective permeation in confined channels and provides a general membrane design concept.

         <title>Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangements by Strain Release: Harnessing Primary Alkyl Radicals for Metal&#8208;Free Arylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22219-22223, October 4, 2021. </description>

The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement has proven to be a powerful tool for the synthesis of new sp3&#8208;aryls via ipso substitution. The reaction has been applied to the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of 3&#8208;aminocyclobutanone oximes, giving cyanide&#8208;free access to &#946;&#8208;amino nitriles under metal&#8208;free, room temperature conditions. The reaction displays a wide scope of migrating arenes.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening of 3&#8208;aminocyclobutanone oximes enables easy generation of primary alkyl radicals, capable of undergoing an unprecedented strain&#8208;release, desulfonylative radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement, providing divergent access to valuable 1,3 diamines and unnatural &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Characterized by mild conditions and wide scope of migrating species, this protocol allows the modular assembly of sp3&#8208;aryls under transition metal&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions.

We report here an asymmetric decarboxylative allylation reaction initiated by the hydrocarboxylation reaction of heteroatom&#8208;substituted allene. The reaction works particularly well with heteroatom&#8208;substituted allenes such as alkoxyallenes and amidoallenes. A number of aryl and alkyl &#946;&#8208;keto acids as well as malonic acid mono&#8208;phenyl ester participates in the reaction to generate &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds possessing stereogenic heteroatom substituents at the &#946;&#8208;position.







Abstract

         <title>Preparation of Bulk&#8208;Phase Nitride Perovskite LaReN3 and Topotactic Reduction to LaNiO2&#8208;Type LaReN2</title>

Nitride perovskites are extremely rare and challenging to synthesise, but an azide&#8208;mediated high&#8208;pressure route has been used to prepare LaReN3 which can be topotactically reduced to layered LaReN2.







Abstract
While halide and oxide perovskites are numerous and many display outstanding properties, ABN3 perovskite nitrides are extremely rare due to synthetic challenges arising from the low chemical potential of nitrogen and a tendency to form low&#8208;coordination nitridometallate anions. We report the preparation of a perovskite nitride LaReN3 through azide&#8208;mediated oxidation at high pressure. High&#8208;resolution synchrotron diffraction shows that LaReN3 has a low&#8208;symmetry, triclinic, perovskite superstructure resulting from orbital ordering with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling distortions. Topotactic reduction of LaReN3 above 500&#8201;&#176;C leads to layered tetragonal LaReN2 via a probable LaReN2.5 intermediate, which is the first reported example of nitride defect perovskites. Magnetisation and conductivity measurements indicate that LaReN3 and LaReN2 are both metallic solids. The two chemical approaches presented are expected to lead to new classes of ABN3 and defect ABN3&#8722;x nitride perovskite materials.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Radical Covalent Organic Frameworks as Highly Efficient and Stable Catalysts for Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22230-22235, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) decorated with nitroxyl radicals are successfully prepared and employed as mild, efficient, and recyclable catalysts for selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.







Abstract
With excellent designability, large accessible inner surface, and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates as metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we report two 3D radical&#8208;based COFs (JUC&#8208;565 and JUC&#8208;566) in which radical moieties (TEMPO) are uniformly decorated on the channel walls via a bottom&#8208;up approach. Based on grafted functional groups and suitable regular channels, these materials open up the application of COFs as highly efficient and selective metal&#8208;free redox catalysts in aerobic oxidation of alcohols to relevant aldehydes or ketones with outstanding turn over frequency (TOF) up to 132&#8197;h&#8722;1, which has exceeded other TEMPO&#8208;modified catalytic materials tested under similar conditions. These stable COF&#8208;based catalysts could be easily recovered and reused for multiple runs. This study promotes potential applications of 3D functional COFs anchored with stable radicals in organic synthesis and material science.

&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) decorated with nitroxyl radicals are successfully prepared and employed as mild, efficient, and recyclable catalysts for selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With excellent designability, large accessible inner surface, and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates as metal-free heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we report two 3D radical-based COFs (JUC-565 and JUC-566) in which radical moieties (TEMPO) are uniformly decorated on the channel walls via a bottom-up approach. Based on grafted functional groups and suitable regular channels, these materials open up the application of COFs as highly efficient and selective metal-free redox catalysts in aerobic oxidation of alcohols to relevant aldehydes or ketones with outstanding turn over frequency (TOF) up to 132&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which has exceeded other TEMPO-modified catalytic materials tested under similar conditions. These stable COF-based catalysts could be easily recovered and reused for multiple runs. This study promotes potential applications of 3D functional COFs anchored with stable radicals in organic synthesis and material science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metagenome&#8208;Guided Analogue Synthesis Yields Improved Gram&#8208;Negative&#8208;Active Albicidin&#8208; and Cystobactamid&#8208;Type Antibiotics</title>

Biosynthetic instructions contained within congener biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been used to guide the synthesis of improved antibiotic analogues. &#961;&#8208;Aminobenzoic acid encoding BGCs cloned from soil metagenomes have guided the synthesis of albicidin and cystobactamid analogues that show increased potency, different spectra of activity, as well as the ability to circumvent resistance conferred by endopeptidase cleavage enzymes.







Abstract
Natural products are a major source of new antibiotics. Here we utilize biosynthetic instructions contained within metagenome&#8208;derived congener biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to guide the synthesis of improved antibiotic analogues. Albicidin and cystobactamid are the first members of a new class of broad&#8208;spectrum &#961;&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA)&#8208;based antibiotics. Our search for PABA&#8208;specific adenylation domain sequences in soil metagenomes revealed that BGCs in this family are common in nature. Twelve BGCs that were bio&#8208;informatically predicted to encode six new congeners were recovered from soil metagenomic libraries. Synthesis of these six predicted structures led to the identification of potent antibiotics with changes in their spectrum of activity and the ability to circumvent resistance conferred by endopeptidase cleavage enzymes.

         <title>Polymer Topology Reinforced Synergistic Interactions among Nanoscale Molecular Clusters for Impact Resistance with Facile Processability and Recoverability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22212-22218, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique physical interaction facilitated by 1D topologies of molecular cluster&#8208;integrated polymers is applied for the design of impact&#8208;resistant materials with exceptional energy dissipation capability and strong rate&#8208;dependent mechanical strengths, enabling the simultaneous achievement of promising impact resistance and processability/recoverability.







Abstract
The intrinsic conflicts between mechanical performances and processability are main challenges to develop cost&#8208;effective impact&#8208;resistant materials from polymers and their composites. Herein, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSSs) are integrated as side chains to the polymer backbones. The one&#8208;dimension (1D) rigid topology imposes strong space confinements to realize synergistic interactions among POSS units, reinforcing the correlations among polymer chains. The afforded composites demonstrate unprecedented mechanical properties with ultra&#8208;stretchability, high rate&#8208;dependent strength, superior impact&#8208;resistant capacity as well as feasible processability/recoverability. The hierarchical structures of the hybrid polymers enable the co&#8208;existence of multiple dynamic relaxations that are responsible for fast energy dissipation and high mechanical strengths. The effective synergistic correlation strategy paves a new pathway for the design of advanced cluster&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Rhodium(I) Complexes Bearing an Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatriene Chain: Catalysts for Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylene and Potential Helical Chirality of 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatrienes</title>

Isolable chiral rhodium(I) complexes bearing a helical aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain were synthesized by one&#8208;pot reactions of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2 with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of 50&#8201;% aqueous KOH (see scheme). The persistent helical chirality of the complexes enabled their separation into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. The complexes served as bench&#8208;stable catalysts for living polymerization of phenylacetylene.







Abstract
Unique bench&#8208;stable rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain have been synthesized by reactions of (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene)rhodium(I) chloride dimer ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2) with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of a 50&#8201;% aqueous solution of KOH. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated complexes indicated a square&#8208;planar structure stabilized by a strong interaction with one of the aryl groups on the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain, which has a helical structure. The helical chirality of the isolated rhodium complexes was confirmed to be sufficiently stable to be resolved into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase at room temperature. It was confirmed that the isolated rhodium complexes functioned as initiators for living polymerization of phenylacetylene to give cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene) with a well&#8208;controlled molecular weight.

         <title>Forrestiacids&#8197;A and&#8197;B, Pentaterpene Inhibitors of ACL and Lipogenesis: Extending the Limits of Computational NMR Methods in the Structure Assignment of Complex Natural Products</title>

Forrestiacids A (1) and B (2), comprising a rearranged spiro&#8208;lanostane unit fused with an abietene by a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, represent a novel class of pentaterpenoids obtained from Pseudotsuga forrestii. Chemical computations demonstrate to be an effective strategy in the structure elucidation of complex molecules. Both 1 and 2 showed potent ACL inhibitory effects, and 1 even significantly attenuated the de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells.







Abstract
Forrestiacids&#8197;A (1) and B (2) are a novel class of [4+2] type pentaterpenoids derived from a rearranged lanostane moiety (dienophile) and an abietane unit (diene). These unprecedented molecules were isolated using guidance by molecular ion networking (MoIN) from Pseudotsuga&#8197;forrestii, an endangered member of the Asian Douglas Fir Family. The intermolecular hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder adducts feature an unusual bicyclo[2.2.2]octene ring system. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, GIAO NMR calculations and DP4+ probability analyses, electronic circular dichroism calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This unique addition to the pentaterpene family represents the largest and the most complex molecule successfully assigned using computational approaches to predict accurately chemical shift values. Compounds&#8197;1 and 2 exhibited potent inhibitory activities (IC50s &lt;5&#8197;&#956;M) of ATP&#8208;citrate lyase (ACL), a new drug target for the treatment of glycolipid metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia. Validating this activity 1 effectively attenuated the de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. These findings provide a new chemical class for developing potential therapeutic agents for ACL&#8208;related diseases with strong links to traditional medicines.

         <title>Electronic Modulation Caused by Interfacial Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M (M=Ru, Ir, Pd) Bonding for Accelerating Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics</title>

A facile and spontaneous strategy is presented for synthesizing Ru&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;anchored metal&#8211;organic framework nanohybrids on Ni foam. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent HER performance at all pH values owing to the optimized adsorption free energies of intermediates by the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.







Abstract
Designing definite metal&#8208;support interfacial bond is an effective strategy for optimizing the intrinsic activity of noble metals, but rather challenging. Herein, a series of quantum&#8208;sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal&#8211;organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni&#8208;MOF, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal&#8208;oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni&#8208;MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics. As a result, the representative Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and recent noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.

         <title>Construction of Co&#8211;Mn Prussian Blue Analog Hollow Spheres for Efficient Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Co&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;rich Prussian Blue Analog (PBA) hollow spheres (CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs) are rationally designed and synthesized through an efficient self&#8208;templating approach. Benefiting from the hollow structure and partial Co substitution, the CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs electrode exhibits enhanced zinc ion storage performance with high capacity, favorable rate capability, and impressive cycling stability.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as reliable and promising cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), but they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to insufficient active sites and structural damage caused by the ion insertion/extraction processes. Herein, a template&#8208;engaged ion exchange approach has been developed for the synthesis of Co&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;rich PBA hollow spheres (CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs) as cathode materials for AZIBs. Benefiting from the multiple advantageous features including hollow structure, abundant active sites, fast Zn2+ ion diffusion, and partial Co substitution, the CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs electrode shows efficient zinc ion storage properties in terms of high capacity, decent rate capability and prolonged cycle life.

         <title>Double Double to Double Perovskite Transformations in Quaternary Manganese Oxides</title>

Thermal transformations under pressure of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A0.5A&#8242;0.5)2BB&#8242;O6 double perovskites with disordered A/A&#8242; cations are demonstrated for CaMnMnWO6 and SmMnMnTaO6, leading to a dramatic switch in magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order to spin glass behaviour in the former.







Abstract
Control of cation ordering in ABX3 perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we show that thermal transformations of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A0.5A&#8242;0.5)2BB&#8242;O6 double perovskites with fully disordered A/A&#8242; cations can be achieved under pressure in CaMnMnWO6 and SmMnMnTaO6, enabling both polymorphs of each material to be recovered. This leads to a dramatic switch of magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order in double double perovskite CaMnMnWO6 to spin glass behaviour in the highly frustrated double perovskite polymorph. Comparison of double double and double perovskite polymorphs of other materials will enable effects of cation order and disorder on other properties such as ferroelectricity and conductivity to be explored.

An intermolecular Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;nitroindoles with readily available allyl carbonates was reported. Good yields (up to 86&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr) are obtained for a wide range of substrates. The compatibility of gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the relatively low catalyst loading (down to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of [Pd]) enhance the practicality of this method.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Enabled by High&#8208;Lying Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>

Through the proposed long&#8208;short axis molecular design, an HLCT&#8208;type ultraviolet emitter is reported. Benefiting from the features of the low&#8208;lying LE emissive state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process, the ultraviolet OLED furnishes a record&#8208;high EQE of 10.79&#8201;%, accompanied by a satisfactory color purity and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) organic emitters that can open up applications for future organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of great value but rarely developed. Here, we report a high&#8208;quality UV emitter with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state and its application in UV OLEDs. The UV emitter, 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz, shows the features of low&#8208;lying locally excited (LE) emissive state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, which helps to balance the color purity and exciton utilization of UV OLED. Consequently, the OLED based on 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz exhibits not only a desired narrowband UV electroluminescent (EL) at 396&#8197;nm with satisfactory color purity (CIEx, y=0.161, 0.031), but also a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.79&#8201;% with small efficiency roll&#8208;off. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance can inspire the design of UV emitters, and pave a way for the further development of high&#8208;performance UV OLEDs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) organic emitters that can open up applications for future organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of great value but rarely developed. Here, we report a high-quality UV emitter with hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) excited state and its application in UV OLEDs. The UV emitter, 2BuCz-CNCz, shows the features of low-lying locally excited (LE) emissive state and high-lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, which helps to balance the color purity and exciton utilization of UV OLED. Consequently, the OLED based on 2BuCz-CNCz exhibits not only a desired narrowband UV electroluminescent (EL) at 396&#8197;nm with satisfactory color purity (CIE&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=0.161, 0.031), but also a record-high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.79&#8201;% with small efficiency roll-off. The state-of-the-art device performance can inspire the design of UV emitters, and pave a way for the further development of high-performance UV OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargyl Ethers with Grignard Reagents for the Synthesis of Functionalized Allenes and Allenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22178-22183, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for facile synthesis of highly substituted allenols and fluoroalkyl allenes via iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of propargyl ethers with Grignard reagents is disclosed. Various tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted fluoroalkyl allenes and &#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;allenols were obtained in good to excellent yields. The reaction was demonstrated to be stereospecific occurring with syn&#8208;SN2&#8242; displacement of the methoxy group by the Grignard reagent.







Abstract
Herein we disclose an iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of propargyl ethers with Grignard reagents. The reaction was demonstrated to be stereospecific and allows for a facile preparation of optically active allenes via efficient chirality transfer. Various tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted fluoroalkyl allenes can be obtained in good to excellent yields. In addition, an iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Grignard reagents with &#945;&#8208;alkynyl oxetanes and tetrahydrofurans is disclosed herein, which constitutes a straightforward approach towards fully substituted &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;allenols, respectively.

         <title>Enhanced ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed recombination and oligonucleotide assembly in peptide&#8208;RNA condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of RNA to catalyze RNA ligation is critical to its central role in many prebiotic model scenarios, in particular the copying of information during self&#8208;replication. Prebiotically plausible ribozymes formed from short oligonucleotides can catalyze reversible RNA cleavage and ligation reactions, but harsh conditions or unusual scenarios are often required to promote folding and drive the reaction equilibrium towards ligation. Here, we demonstrate that ribozyme activity is greatly enhanced by charge&#8208;mediated phase separation with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, which shifts the reaction equilibrium from cleavage in solution to ligation in peptide&#8208;RNA coaggregates and coacervates. This compartmentalization enables robust isothermal RNA assembly over a broad range of conditions, which can be leveraged to assemble long and complex RNAs from short fragments under mild conditions in the absence of exogenous activation chemistry, bridging the gap between pools of short oligomers and functional RNAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Enhanced Li+ Transport Ability Enables Stable Li Deposition for&#160;High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;O2&#160; Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte could endow Li&#8208;O  2  batteries with low charging overpotential. However, the weak Li  +  transport ability (LTA) leads to non&#8208;uniform Li deposition. Herein, guided by Sand formula, the LTA of TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is greatly enhanced to realize robust Li deposition through introducing hydrofluoroether (HFE) and optimizing electrolyte component ratios to regulate solvation environment. The solvation environment changes from Li(TFSI)  2  &#8211;  ion pair into ionic aggregate clusters in the optimal electrolyte thanks to the slicing function of HFE toward ionic aggregate network. As a result, the transport parameters of Sand formula are synchronously enhanced, resulting in highly robust Li deposition behavior with greatly improved Coulombic efficiency (~97.5%) and cycling rate (1 mA cm  &#8211;2  ). Moreover, cycling stability of Li&#8208;O  2  batteries could be greatly improved (a tiny overpotential rise of 64 mV after 75 cycles). This work provides a new perspective to promote the practical application of TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(perfluoropinacolato)silane: A Neutral Silane Lewis Superacid Activates Si&#8208;F bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the earth abundance and easy availability of silicon, only few examples of isolable neutral silicon centered Lewis superacids are precedent in the literature. To approach the general drawbacks of limited solubility and unselective deactivation pathways, we introduce a Lewis superacid, based on perfluorinated pinacol substituents. The compound is easily synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale as the corresponding acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct  1  &#8729;(MeCN) and was fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SC&#8208;XRD) and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations. Lewis acidity investigations by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and fluoride abstraction experiments indicate a Lewis superacidic nature. The challenging Si&#8208;F bond activation of Et  3  SiF is realized and promising catalytic properties are demonstrated, consolidating the potential applicability of silicon centered Lewis acids in synthetic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Superfast and Water&#8208;Insensitive Polymerization on &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides to Prepare Polypeptides using Tetraalkylammonium carboxylates as the Initiator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins and peptides have diverse biological functions and applications, however, their efficient chemical synthesis is still challenging. We design the tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated superfast polymerization on &#945;&#8208;amino acid  N  &#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCA) for efficient synthesis of polypeptides. Carboxylates, as a new class of initiator for NCA polymerization, can initiate the superfast NCA polymerization without the need of extra catalyst and the polymerization can be operated in open vessels at ambient condition without the use of glove box. Tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated polymerization on NCA easily affords block copolymers with at least 15 blocks. Moreover, this method avoids tedious purification steps and enables direct polymerization on crude NCAs in aqueous environments to prepare polypeptides and one&#8208;pot synthesis of polypeptide nanoparticles. These advantages and the mild polymerization condition of tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated NCA polymerization imply its great potential in functional exploration and application of polypeptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavily Tungsten Doped Sodium Thioantimonate Solid State Electrolytes with Exceptionally Low Activation Energy for Ionic Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study puts forward a powerful strategy based on multiple synergistic design rules for modifying the structure of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na  2.895  W  0.3  Sb  0.7  S  4  and Na  2.7  W  0.3  Sb  0.7  S  4  are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09 eV, 24.2 mS/cm and 0.12 eV, 14.5 mS/cm. At &#8208;15 &#8451; the Na  2.895  W  0.3  Sb  0.7  S  4  displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5 mS/cm. The 30% W content goes far beyond the 10&#8208;12% reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo&#8208;cubic or orthorhombic structures. Theoretical studies based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that these properties result from a combination of multiple diffusion mechanisms, including vacancy defects, strongly correlated modes and excessive Na&#8208;ions. An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) using Na  2.895  W  0.3  Sb  0.7  S  4  as the primary SSE and a sodium sulfide (Na  2  S) cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 400 mAh/g.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Recognition of Quinones in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity with Anthracene Sidewalls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective molecular recognition in water is the foundation of numerous biological functions. In contrast, this remains a challenge for synthetic hosts. Recently, several biomimetic hosts brought hope by shielding hydrogen bonding in a hydrophobic cavity. However, general guidelines for the design and synthesis of such biomimetic hosts are still urgently needed. Herein, we propose the concept of  endo  &#8208;functionalized cavity and the strategy of &#8220;simultaneous construction&#8221; to address this issue. The concept and the strategy were demonstrated in the construction of a biomimetic host for selectively recognizing quinones in water. The host was synthesized by joining two pieces of bent anthracene dimer through amide bond formation, affording a deep hydrophobic cavity and inward&#8208;directing hydrogen bonding sites simultaneously. The host can selectively recognize quinones over their close analogues in water, and its association affinity to  p  &#8208;benzoquinone is the highest among all the known hosts and is even comparable to that of the bioreceptor. The binding with anthraquinone reaches nanomolar affinity. Shielded hydrogen bonding, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;, and charge transfer interactions, and the hydrophobic effect were revealed to be responsible for the high binding affinity and selectivity. The concept and the synthetic strategy demonstrated here may be used as one of general guidelines for biomimetic molecular recognition in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Reduction via Integrated Construction and Synergistic Catalysis of Porous Platinum Alloy and Defective Graphitic Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrated fabrication through the strong interaction between catalyst and carrier is crucial to realize efficient oxygen electrocatalysis for fuel cells. We report herein a porous Pt&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon via integration engineering, where a synergistic catalysis between ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C results in the optimized reaction pathway and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The hybrid catalyst PtCuCo@Co&#8208;N&#8208;C delivers a mass activity of 1.14 A mgPt&#8208;1 at 0.9 V vs. RHE and a peak power density of 960 mW cm&#8208;2 in the full&#8208;cell assessment, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.12 A mgPt&#8208;1 and 780 mW cm&#8208;2). Experimental results combined with theoretical simulations suggest that the mutual assistance between porous Pt alloy and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C accounts for the enhanced catalytic performance. Such integrated engineering concept is significant for strengthening the anti&#8208;corrosion capabilities and improving ORR performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Solvatochromic Fluorescent Probe Reveals Polarity Heterogeneity upon Protein Aggregation in Cells.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physicochemical details at the interphase of protein aggregation have been less explored especially in live cells. Herein, we reported a crystallization induced emission fluorophore to quantitatively interrogate the polarity of aggregated proteins. This solvatochromic probe, namely &#8220;AggRetina&#8221; probe, inherently binds to aggregated proteins and exhibits both polarity&#8208;dependent fluorescence emission wavelength shift and viscosity&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity increase. Regulation of its polarity sensitivity was achieved by extending the conjugation length. Empowered by this probe, we observed that different proteins bear diverse polarity upon aggregation, leading to different resistance to proteolysis. We further showed that polarity primarily decreases during protein misfolding but viscosity mainly increases upon the formation of insoluble aggregates.&#160; Finally, we quantified the polarity of aggregated protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest in live cells via HaloTag bioorthogonal labeling, revealing polarity heterogeneity within cellular aggregates. This work highlights the enriched micro&#8208;environment details inside misfolded and aggregated proteins that may correlate to their bio&#8208;chemical properties and pathogenicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Organic Framework in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate control of the layer number of orderly stacked 2D polymers has been an unsettled challenge in self&#8208;assembly. Herein we describe the fabrication of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework from a monolayer 2D supramolecular organic framework in water by utilizing the multivalent coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligands to zinc porphyrin subunits of the monolayer network. The monolayer supramolecular framework is prepared from the co&#8208;assembly of an octacationic zinc porphyrin monomer and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in water through CB[8]&#8208;encapsulation&#8208;promoted dimerization of 4&#8208;phenylpyridiunium subunits that the zinc porphyrin monomer bear. The bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework exhibits structural regularity in both solution and the solid state, which is characterized by synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopic techniques. Atomic force microscopic imaging confirms that the bilayer character of the 2D supramolecular organic framework can be realized selectively on the micrometer scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Hydroamination of Alkenes with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and general radical hydroamination of alkenes using Co(salen) as catalyst, N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and its analogues as both nitrogen source and oxidant was successfully disclosed. A variety of alkenes, including aliphatic alkenes, styrenes, &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, acids, as well as enones, were all compatible to provide desired amination products. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction underwent a metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkene, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles. Moreover, by virtue of modified chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst, an unprecedented asymmetric version was also achieved with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol. This novel asymmetric radical C&#8722;N bond construction opens a new door for the challenging asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodology. Herein, we report the preparation of a 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline (AZ)&#8208;linked crystalline 2D polymer  AZP  via acid mediated Friedl&#228;nder synthesis. The feasibility was examined first by two model reactions, followed by synthesis of three AZ&#8208;based macrocycles  MCn  (n=5&#8208;7), in which hexagonal  MC6  was isolated as the major product. The favorable macrocycle formation could be largely attributed to the dynamic feature of Friedl&#228;nder synthesis, which involves both imine condensation and aldol condensation. The structure and crystallinity of  AZP  were confirmed by experiments and simulation. The skeletons of the macrocycles and polymer consist of all&#8208;sp2  hybridized C/N atoms and are thus &#960;&#8208;conjugated and electro&#8208;active. Our studies provide a rational way to access kinetically stable 2D crystalline polymers by combination of different dynamic covalent chemistries.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced On/Off Switching of the Surfactant Character of the o&#8208;Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Anion with No Covalent Bond Alteration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([  o  &#8208;COSAN]  &#8208;  ) is a well&#8208;known metallacarborane with multiple applications in a variety of fields. In aqueous solution, the  cisoid  rotamer is the most stable disposition in the ground state. The present work provides theoretical evidence on the possibility to photoinduce the rotation from the  cisoid  to the  transoid  rotamer, a conversion that can be reverted when the ground state is repopulated. The non&#8208;radiative decay mechanisms proposed in this work are coherent with the lack of fluorescence observed in 3D fluorescence mapping experiments performed on [  o  &#8208;COSAN]  &#8208;  and its derivatives. This phenomenon induced by light has the potential to destruct the vesicles and micelles  cisoid  [  o  &#8208;COSAN]  &#8208;  typically forms in aqueous solution, which could lead to promising applications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>SmCo5 with a reconstructed oxyhydroxide surface for spin selective water oxidation under elevated temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of electrolytic hydrogen production is limited by the slow reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface reconstructed ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts with spin pinning effect at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface could enhance the spin&#8208;dependent OER kinetics. However, in real&#8208;life applications electrolyzers are operated under elevated temperature, which may disrupt the spin orientations of FM catalysts and limit their performance. In this work, we prepared surface reconstructed SmCo  5  /CoO  x  H  y  , which possesses polarized spins at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface that leads to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins could be further aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. Moreover, the operation temperature was elevated to mimic water electrolyzers&#8217; practical operation conditions. It is found that the OER activity enhancement of magnetized SmCo  5  /CoO  x  H  y  catalyst can be preserved up to 60 &#186;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15 Nanocluster with Atomic Precision: Structural&#160;Analysis and Electrocatalytic Performance toward CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise Ag nanoclusters provide an ideal platform to&#160;correlate the structure and electrocatalytic performance at the atomic level.&#160;Herein, we report the fabrication of homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15(C&#8801;CtBu)12+ (abbreviated as Ag15) nanocluster and its electrocatalytic properties&#160;toward CO2 reduction reaction. Crystal structure analysis reveals that, Ag15
possesses a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure with an Ag@Ag8@Ag6&#160;metal core configuration. Interestingly, we found that, Ag15 can adsorb CO2&#160;in air and spontaneously self&#8208;assembled into one&#8208;dimensional linear material&#160;during the crystal growth process. Furthermore, Ag15 can convert CO2 into&#160;CO with a faradaic efficiency of ~95.0% at &#8208;0.6 V and a maximal turnover
frequency of 6.37 s&#8208;1 at &#8208;1.1 V along with excellent long&#8208;term stability.&#160;Finally, density functional theory calculations disclosed that, Ag15(C&#8801;CtBu)11+ with one alkynyl ligand stripping off from the intact cluster can&#160;expose the uncoordinated Ag atom as the catalytically active site for CO&#160;formation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Functional DNA molecules are useful components in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. To expand the toolkit of functional DNA parts, in this study we used artificial evolution to identify a glowing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This deoxyribozyme transfers a phosphate from a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate to its 5' hydroxyl group, which triggers a chemiluminescent reaction and a flash of blue light. An engineered version of Supernova is only catalytically active in the presence of an oligonucleotide complementary to its 3' end, demonstrating that light production can be coupled to ligand binding. We anticipate that Supernova will be useful in a wide variety of applications, including as a signaling component in allosterically regulated sensors and in logic gates of molecular computers.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Functional Thermoplastic Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Properties by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Copolymerization of Ethylene and Fluorostyrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) from ethylene and functionalized comonomers is of theoretical interest and practical importance. Herein, we report copolymerizations of ethylene (E) and  ortho&#8208;  /  meta&#8208;  /  para&#8208;  fluorostyrenes (S  F  =  o  FS/  m  FS/  p  FS) by using quinolyl methylene fluorenyl scandium complex (Flu&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;Qu)Sc(CH  2  SiMe  3  )  2  . The copolymerizations proceed in a controlled fashion to afford copolymers composed of &#8220;soft&#8221; ethylene&#8208;fluorostyurene (E&#8208;S  F  ) random segments (  T  g  = &#8208;22.2&#8208;5.1 &#176;C) and &#8220;hard&#8221; crystalline ethylene&#8208;ethylene (E&#8208;E) segments (  T  m  = 42.3&#8208;130.2 &#176;C). The copolymers behave like thermoplastic elastomers at room temperature by showing high stress values up to 39.5 MPa under elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break above 774% with elastic recovery over 75%. The excellent mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the microphase separation of the nanoscale crystalline E&#8208;E domain from the amorphous E&#8208;S  F  copolymer matrix proved by AFM, WAXD and SAXS. The mechanism investigation by the density functional theory (DFT) simulation reveals that the steric bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing ligand of the catalytic precursor prefers E propagation to generate long E&#8208;E segments, while the incorporation of S  F  is thermodynamic control.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Low&#8208;Strain Phosphate Cathode for High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Cycle&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) cathode materials have deficient structural stability because of the huge radius of potassium ion, leading to inferior cycling performance. In this work, we report the controllable synthesis of a novel low&#8208;strain phosphate material K  3  (VO)(HV  2  O  3  )(PO  4  )  2  (HPO  4  ) (denoted KVP) nanorulers as an efficient cathode for PIBs. The as&#8208;synthesized KVP nanoruler cathode can exhibit an initial reversible capacity of 80.6 mAh g  &#8722;1  under 20 mA g  &#8722;1  , with a large average working potential of 4.11 V. It can also manifest an excellent rate property of 54.4 mAh g  &#8722;1  under 5 A g  &#8722;1  , with an exceedingly high capacity preservation of 92.1% over 2500 cycles. The outstanding potassium storage capability of KVP nanoruler cathode originates from low&#8208;strain K  +  uptake/removal mechanism, inherent semiconductor characteristic, and small K  +  migration energy barrier. The high energy density and prolonged cyclic stability of KVP nanorulers//polyaniline&#8208;intercalated layered titanate full battery verifies the superiority of KVP nanoruler cathode in PIBs. Our results show that this high&#8208;voltage low&#8208;strain phosphate material is a competitive cathode for PIBs and will draw more attention and investigations in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of a dilithiomethane with CO and N2O: An avenue to an anionic ketene and a hexafunctionalized benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from simple C1 feedstocks is an attractive alternative avenue to traditional fossil fuels. Hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives are highly useful molecules but are often challenging to prepare. Herein, we report that the dianion [(Ph  2  P(S))  2  CLi  2  (THF)]  2  1  reacts with CO lead to C&#8208;C bond formation and migration of a Ph  2  P(S)&#8208;fragment affording 2. Subsequent reaction with N  2  O results in oxidative cleavage of a P&#8208;C bond affording [Ph  2  P(S)OLi(THF)  2  ]  2  4  and the anionic ketene&#8208;derivative Ph  2  P(S)CCOLi(THF)  2  5  . Heating  5  prompts cyclotrimerization giving the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative [Ph  2  P(S)CCOLi(THF)  2  ]  3  6  regioselectively. This transition metal&#8208;free protocol to a hexa&#8208;substituted benzene is viable on a gram scale and permits the incorporation of  13  C labels. The mechanisms of these reactions are detailed via extensive DFT computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Classification of Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides as a Tool for the Design of Inorganic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classification of copper sulfides based on crystallographic features has been proposed from investigation of the structure&#8211;property relationships reported on their phases in dozens of publications from the fields of crystallography and materials for energy conversion. This classification reveals systematic trends that can be explained and exploited for the design and engineering of new environmentally friendly materials.







Abstract
Research focusing on the interplay between structural features and transport properties of inorganic materials is of paramount importance for the identification, comprehension, and optimisation of functional materials. In this respect, Earth&#8208;abundant copper sulfides have been receiving considerable attention from scientists as the urgency remains to discover and improve the efficiency of sustainable materials for energy applications. This proposed classification of copper sulfides, associated with p&#8208; and/or d&#8208;block elements, is based on their crystallographic features and an analysis of their transport properties. It provides guidelines to help estimate some properties of new materials (type of main charge carriers, thermal conductivity, transport mechanisms, etc.) from consideration of only their chemical composition and crystal structure. The classification relies primarily on recent studies in the fields of thermoelectricity and photovoltaics as well as on crystal&#8208;structure investigations.

         <title>Intragenomic Decarboxylation of 5&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A possibility that 5&#8208;carboxydC (cadC), which is a modification found in somatic and stem cells, is directly decarboxylated to dC via C&#8722;C bond cleavage in cells is suggested.







Abstract
Cellular DNA is composed of four canonical nucleosides (dA, dC, dG and T), which form two Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. In addition, 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mdC) may be present. The methylation of dC to mdC is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Next to these five nucleosides, the genome, particularly of stem cells, contains three additional dC derivatives, which are formed by stepwise oxidation of the methyl group of mdC with the help of Tet enzymes. These are 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC), and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intragenomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. By using metabolic labelling, we show here that cadC decarboxylates in several cell types, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8722;C bond cleavage.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Phase&#8208;Recognition&#8208;Induced Domino Phase Transition and Luminescence Switching for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline phase recognition promoted the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transition of a metal halide by inducing a domino phase transition (DPT). A DPT occurred when single crystals of chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) recognized those of achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (see picture). Concomitant photoluminescence switching enabled in situ observation of the DPT, the potential of which for time&#8208;resolved encryption was demonstrated.







Abstract
Herein, a new mechanism, namely, crystalline phase recognition (CPR), is proposed for the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition of metal halides. Chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) can recognize achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 on the basis of a key&#8211;lock feature through intercontact of their single crystals, resulting in a domino phase transition (DPT). The concomitant photoluminescence (PL) switching enables observation of the DPT in situ. The liquid eutectic interface, stress&#8211;strain transfer, and feasible thermodynamics are key issues for the CPR. DFT calculations and PL measurements revealed that the optical absorption and emission of the isomers mainly originate from [SbCl5]2&#8722; anions. The structural effects (e.g., supramolecular interactions and [SbCl5]2&#8722; distortion) on the optical emission are clarified. As a novel type of stimuli response, the CPR&#8208;induced DPT and luminescence switching exhibit potential for application in advanced time&#8208;resolved information encryption.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Selective Synthesis of a Semiconductive Silver Thiolate Coordination Polymer with Segregated Paths for Holes and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductive trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based coordination polymers (CPs) containing Ag&#8722;S bonds were synthesized using machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted techniques. One of the obtained CPs, [Ag2Httc]n (KGF&#8208;6), features a three dimensionally extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with one&#8208;dimensional column structures of stacked triazine rings. This network structure provides segregated paths for holes and electrons (see picture).







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;sulfur bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties. However, the development of new (&#8208;M&#8208;S&#8208;)n&#8208;structured CPs is hindered by difficulties with their crystallization. Herein, we describe the use of machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8722;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag2Httc]n, features a 3D&#8208;extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first&#8208;principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag2Httc]n is highly photoconductive (&#966;&#931;&#956;max=1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs with selective topologies that are difficult to crystallize.

         <title>Bright Luminescence in Three Phases&#8212;A Combined Synthetic, Spectroscopic and Theoretical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence of Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au (M=Cu, Ag, Au) &#8220;molecular wire&#8221; complexes was studied in detail by comparative measurements in solution, in the solid state and in the gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.







Abstract
Combining phase&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements and quantum chemical calculations is a powerful approach to help understand the influence of the molecular surroundings on the PL properties. Herein, a phosphine functionalized amidinate was used to synthesize a recently presented bimetallic gold complex, featuring an unusual charge separation. The latter was subsequently used as metalloligand to yield heterotetrametallic complexes with an Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au &#8220;molecular wire&#8221; arrangement (M=Cu, Ag, Au) featuring metallophilic interactions. All compounds show bright phosphorescence in the solid state, also at ambient temperature. The effect of the molecular environment on the PL was studied in detail for these tetrametallic complexes by comparative measurements in solution, in the solid state and in the gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Dopant&#8208;Promoted Electroreduction of CO2 over Coordinatively Unsaturated Ni&#8208;N2 Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potential&#8208;dependent stability of doped S atom was observed in the dual&#8208;heteroatom anchored unsaturated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst prepared by a rapid microwave&#8208;induced plasma method. Sulfur dopants including coordinated S atoms and evolutive S vacancies effectively modulate coordination environment around Ni sites and further facilitate the CO2 reduction over the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N2 moieties.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) moieties are promising for efficient electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, it is essential but challenging to steer the coordination environment of Ni centers for promoting the CO formation kinetics. Here, we introduce alien sulfur atoms to tune the local electronic density of unsaturated NiN2 species. A coordinated structure evolution is detected and S vacancies are generated at high overpotentials, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The sulfur dopants enhance CO selectivity and activity over normal unsaturated NiN2 structure, reaching a high CO Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and a large CO current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;cell at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and &#8722;0.9&#8197;V (vs. RHE), respectively. DFT calculations reveal both doped S atoms and evolved S vacancies in the NiN2 coordination environment contribute to the reduced energy barriers for CO2 electroreduction to CO.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Spirolactams via Sequential C&#8722;H Olefination/Asymmetric [4+1] Spirocyclization under a Simple CoII/Chiral Spiro Phosphoric Acid Binary System</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple CoII/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported, providing a straightforward route for the asymmetric synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with high enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
An unprecedented enantioselective synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple CoII/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported. A range of biologically important spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams are obtained with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The concise, asymmetric synthesis of an aldose reductase inhibitor was successfully achieved. Notably, contrast to previous reports that relied on the use of cyclopentadienyl or its derivatives (achiral Cp*, CptBu, or chiral Cpx) ligated CoIII complexes requiring tedious steps to prepare, cheap and commercially available cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate was used as an efficient precatalyst.

         <title>Lithium Ion Repulsion&#8208;Enrichment Synergism Induced by Core&#8211;Shell Ionic Complexes to Enable High&#8208;Loading Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell additive with anionic Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) cluster as core and N&#8208;containing cation of ionic liquid (IL) as shell is proposed to stabilize Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The gradually released POM cores with negative charge enrich Li+ and co&#8208;assemble with Li. The Li+ repulsion&#8208;enrichment synergism can compact Li deposition and reinforce the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
A core&#8211;shell additive with anionic Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) cluster as core and N&#8208;containing cation of ionic liquid (IL) as shell is proposed to stabilize Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The suspended POM derived complex in ether&#8208;based electrolyte is absorbed around the protuberances of anode and triggers a lithiophobic repulsion mechanism for the homogenization of Li+ redistribution. The gradually released POM cores with negative charge then enrich Li+ and co&#8208;assemble with Li. The Li+ repulsion&#8208;enrichment synergism can compact Li deposition and reinforce solid electrolyte interphase. This sustained&#8208;release additive enables Li&#8741;Li symmetric cells with a long lifetime over 500&#8197;h and 300&#8197;h at high current densities of 3 and 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. The complex additive is also compatible with high&#8208;voltage Li&#8741;LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cells. Even with a NCA loading as high as ca. 20&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the additive contained Li&#8741;NCA cell can still cycle for over 100&#8197;cycles at 2.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Doxorubicin&#8208;Sensitized Luminescence of NIR&#8208;Emitting Ytterbium Liposomes: Towards Direct Monitoring of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doxorubicin&#8208;sensitized near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission of Yb3+ is observable in solutions of liposomes encapsulating the drug and amphiphilic Yb3+ complexes. This emission vanishes when the liposome is destroyed and doxorubicin is released. The NIR Yb3+ luminescence could be observed in living mice with a commercial macroscopic setup.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;loaded liposomes are typical examples of nanomedicines. We show here that doxorubicin, the anti&#8208;cancer agent in the liposomal drug Doxil, can sensitize Ytterbium (Yb3+) and generate its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission. When doxorubicin and amphiphilic Yb3+ chelates are incorporated into liposomes, the sensitized emission of Yb3+ is dependent on the integrity of the particles, which can be used to monitor drug release. We also established the first demonstration that the NIR Yb3+ emission signal is observable in living mice following intratumoral injection of the Yb3+&#8208;doxorubicin&#8208;liposomes, using a commercial macroscopic setup equipped with a NIR camera.

         <title>Deep Learning for Voltammetric Sensing in a Living Animal Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric (DLV) sensing platform is developed for highly selective and multiplexed analysis of neurochemicals in&#8197;vivo. With the DLV sensor, we reveal the interplay between the concentrations of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in the living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing methods. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite basic research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Numerous neurochemicals have been implicated in the modulation of brain function, making them appealing analytes for sensors and diagnostics. However, it is a grand challenge to selectively measure multiple neurochemicals simultaneously in&#8197;vivo because of their great variations in concentrations, dynamic nature, and composition. Herein, we present a deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric sensing platform for the highly selective and simultaneous analysis of three neurochemicals in a living animal brain. The system features a carbon fiber electrode capable of capturing the mixed dynamics of a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and ions. Then a powerful deep neural network is employed to resolve individual chemical and spatial&#8208;temporal information. With this, a single electrochemical measurement reveals an interplaying concentration changes of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing analytical methodologies. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Chiral Arylamines, Alkylamines and Amides by Enantioselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminations have been developed by using nitroarenes, hydroxylamines, or dioxazolones as aminating reagents. This modular process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral benzylic arylamines, alkylamines, and amides from styrenes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroarylamination, hydroalkylamination and hydroamidation of styrenes have been developed by NiH catalysis with a simple bioxazoline ligand under mild conditions. A wide range of enantioenriched benzylic arylamines, alkylamines and amides can be easily accessed by nitroarenes, hydroxylamines and dioxazolones, respectively as amination reagents. The chiral induction in these reactions is proposed to proceed through an enantiodifferentiating syn&#8208;hydronickellation step.

         <title>Nano&#8208;analysis Reveals High Fraction of Serotonin Release during Exocytosis from a Gut Epithelium Model Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gut&#8208;derived serotonin signaling plays key roles in the modulation of normal GI motility and inflammation. Electrochemical methods were used to study the release of serotonin during exocytosis in human carcinoid BON cells, which was found to be predominantly partial, with vesicles releasing a large fraction of serotonin during each exocytosis event. This finding provides new insights into therapeutic targets for treating GI diseases.







Abstract
Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5&#8208;HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in&#8197;vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut&#8208;derived 5&#8208;HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5&#8208;HT release in BON cells is 80&#8201;% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34&#8201;%). The fractional release increased from 80&#8201;% in control BON cells to 87&#8201;% with 5&#8208;HT preincubation and nearly 100&#8201;% with the combination of 5&#8208;HT and the 5&#8208;HT4 autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5&#8208;HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5-HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in&#8197;vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut-derived 5-HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5-HT release in BON cells is 80&#8201;% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34&#8201;%). The fractional release increased from 80&#8201;% in control BON cells to 87&#8201;% with 5-HT preincubation and nearly 100&#8201;% with the combination of 5-HT and the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released.

         <title>Unexpected Formation of Metallofulleroids from Multicomponent Reactions, with Crystallographic and Computational Studies of the Cluster Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New multicomponent reactions involving an isocyanide, terminal or internal alkynes, and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) Lu  3  N@C  80  yield metallofulleroids which are characterized by mass&#8208;spectrometry, HPLC, and multiple 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Single crystal studies revealed one ketenimine metallofulleroid has ordered Lu  3  N cluster which is unusual for EMF monoadducts. Computational analysis, based on crystallographic data, confirm that the endohedral cluster motion is controlled by the position of the exohedral organic appendants. Our findings provide a new functionalization reaction for EMFs, and a potential facile approach to freeze the endohedral cluster motion at relatively high temperatures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>White&#8208;light emitting polymers (WLEPs) based on aggregation microenvironment&#8208;sensitive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have aroused great interest in lighting and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we developed a novel strategy to construct WLEP particles  via  a stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation polymerization of two emission&#8208;complementary AIEgens under core&#8208;shell engineering, where the AIE characteristics and FRET process of core&#8208;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) could be modulated by altering aggregation microenvironment under swelling and shrinking of polymers, facilitating the tunable white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs. Furthermore, such tuning could be fast realized in the solid state, thus demonstrating the potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work proved the significance of aggregation microenvironment on emission of luminogens, guiding the development of high&#8208;efficiency&#160;emission&#8208;tunable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Configurational Lability in Aza&#8208;Sulfur Compounds for the Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for establishing the absolute configuration of sulfur&#8208;stereogenic aza&#8208;sulfur derivatives are scarce, often relying on cumbersome protocols and a limited pool of enantioenriched starting materials. We have addressed this by exploiting, for the first time, a feature of sulfonimidamides in which it is possible for tautomeric structures to also be enantiomeric. Such sulfonimidamides can readily generate prochiral ions, which we have exploited in an enantioselective alkylation process. Selectivity is achieved using a readily prepared bis&#8208;quaternized phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The overall process establishes the capability of configurationally labile aza&#8208;sulfur species to be used in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report an approach for the intramolecular C(sp  2  )&#8211;H amidation of  N  &#8208;acyloxyamides under photoredox conditions to produce  &#948;  &#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8211;alkyl  &#963;  &#8208;bond relocation. Computational studies on the designed reductive single electron transfer strategy led us to identify  N  &#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] group as the most effective amidyl radical precursor.

         <title>Is organic chemistry really growing exponentially?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In terms of molecules and specific reaction examples reported in the literature, organic chemistry features an impressive, exponential growth. However, new reaction classes/types that fuel this growth are being discovered at a much slower and only linear (or even sublinear) rate. In effect, the proportion of newly discovered reaction types to all reactions being performed keeps decreasing, suggesting that synthetic chemistry becomes more reliant on reusing the well&#8208;known methods. On the brighter side, the newly discovered chemistries are more complex than decades ago, and allow for the rapid construction of complex scaffolds in fewer numbers of steps. In this paper, we study these and other trends in the function of time, reaction&#8208;type &#8220;popularity&#8221; and complexity based on the algorithm that extracts generalized reaction class templates. These analyses are useful in the context of computer&#8208;assisted synthesis, machine learning (to estimate the numbers of models with sufficient reaction statistics), and also for identifying erroneous entries in reaction databases.</dc:description>

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroallylation of Aryl Halides and Pseudo Halides with Difluoroallylboron Reagents in High Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed  gem  &#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl halides and pseudo halides with 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronates in high yield with high regioselectivity, and we report the preparation of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronate reactants by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of inexpensive gaseous 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene with bis(pinacolato)diboron. The  gem  &#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl and heteroaryl bromides proceeds with low catalyst loading (0.1 mol% [Pd]) and tolerates a wide range of functional groups, including primary alcohols, secondary amines, ethers, ketones, esters, amides, aldehydes, nitriles, halides, and nitro groups. This protocol extends to aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates, as well as substituted difluoroallyl boronates, providing a versatile synthesis of  gem  &#8208;difluoroallyl arenes that we show to be valuable intermediates to a series of fluorinated building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platform for Site&#8208;Specific DNA&#8208;Antibody Bioconjugation by Using Benzoylacrylic&#8208;labelled Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many bioconjugation strategies for DNA oligonucleotides and antibodies suffer limitations, such as site&#8208;specificity, stoichiometry and hydrolytic instability of the conjugates, which makes them unsuitable for biological applications. Here, we report a new platform for the preparation of DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates with a simple benzoylacrylic acid pentafluorophenyl ester reagent. Benzoylacrylic&#8208;labelled oligonucleotides prepared with this reagent can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a range of proteins and antibodies through accessible cysteine residues. The homogeneity of the prepared DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates was confirmed by a new LC&#8211;MS protocol and the bioconjugate probes were used in fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution microscopy cell imaging experiments. This work demonstrates the versatility and robustness of our bioconjugation protocol that gives site&#8208;specific, well&#8208;defined and plasma&#8208;stable DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, structure and reactivity of a cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a facile synthesis of the cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH  2  ] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 = 1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with dimethyl  N  &#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)  2  C=N(CN). The reaction proceeds with elimination of two equivalents of methanol. Careful tuning of the reaction conditions allowed for the isolation and characterization of the  N  &#8208;cyano(carboximidate)phosphide intermediate [HP{C(OMe)N(CN)}]  &#8722;  . Due to the adverse effects of methanol in these reaction mixtures, a bulk scale synthesis of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] could be achieved by addition of a base (LiHMDS) to neutralize the resulting alcohol. Further reactivity studies of this anion reveal that functionalization at the phosphorus atom is viable to yield a new family of cyanide&#8208;functionalised phosphorus heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Nanozyme Platform with Activity&#8208;Correlated Ratiometric Molecular Imaging for Predicating Therapeutic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like characteristics have attracted enormous research interest in biological application, due to their higher catalytic stability and activity than many natural enzymes. However, there is still a lack of facile approach for real&#8208;time evaluating the catalytic activity of nanozymes in living system, which limits their application in precise treatment of disease. Herein, we develop a novel manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) with oxidase&#8208;like activity for dynamically reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;induced cancer therapy via ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. Notably, MSPN possess oxidase&#8208;like activity in tumor microenvironment, owing to the mixed&#8208;valent MnOx nanoparticles ((Mn II  ) 1  (Mn III  ) 1.56  (Mn IV  ) 1.4  O 6.14  ), which can effectively kill cancer cells. Because the semiconducting polymer (PFODBT) is conjugated with oxidase&#8208;responsive molecule (ORM) via amide bond, the catalyitic activity of nanozyme can be correlated with the ratiometric sginals of NIRF (FL 695  /FL 825  ) and PA (PA 680  /PA 780  ). Therefore, our integrated catalyitic and imaging platform represents an innovative strategy that can not only achieve effective catalyitic activity in vivo, but also be used to real&#8208;time monitor the nanozyme acitivity itself, which may provide new ideas for predicating anticancer effiecncy of nanozymes in biological condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Generation of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Triply&#8208;Reduced Warped Nanographenes: Charge&#8208;Dependent Aromaticity, Surface Nonequivalence, Swing Distortion and Metal Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stepwise chemical reduction of molecular warped nanographene (WNG) having a negatively curved  &#960;  &#8208;surface and defined C  80  H  30  composition with Cs metal used as the reducing and complexing agent allowed the isolation of three different reduced states with one, two, and three electrons added to its  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated system. This provided a unique series of contorted nanosized carbanions with increasing negative charge for in&#8208;depth structural analysis of consequences of controlled electron charging of non&#8208;planar nanographenes, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational tools. The 3D molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps identified the negative charge localization at the central part of the WNG surface where selective coordination of Cs  +  ions has been confirmed crystallographically. In&#8208;depth theoretical investigation revealed a complex response of WNG to the stepwise electron acquisition. The extended and contorted  &#960;  &#8208;surface of WNG undergoes subtle swinging distortions that are accompanied by notable changes in the electronic structure and site&#8208;dependent aromaticity of the resulting nanosized carbanions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrosobenzene&#8208;Enabled Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomeric N&#8208;Arylbenzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is an imidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol. It is worth reflecting on the unique roles played by the nitroso group in this domino reaction. It functions as a linchpin by first offering an electrophilic site (N) for the initial C&#8208;N bond formation while the resulting amine performs the nucleophilic addition to form the second C&#8208;N bond. Additionally, it could facilitate the final oxidative aromatization as an oxidant. The atropisomeric products could be conveniently elaborated to a series of axially chiral derivatives, enabling the exploitation of N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles for their potential utilities in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering and Suppressing the Over&#8208;oxidized Nitrogen in Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea electrolysis is a prospective technology for simultaneous H2  production and nitrogen abatement toward water&#8208;energy nexus. Its sustainability is currently founded on the innocuous N2  products; however, herein, we discovered the prevalent nickel&#8208;based catalysts could generally over&#8208;oxidize urea into NO2&#8208;  products with ~80% Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazard to the environment. Trace amounts of over&#8208;oxidized NO3&#8208;  and N2O were also detected. By  15N isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen fate network, involving a NO2&#8208;  formation pathway  via  OH&#8208;&#8208;assisted C&#8208;N cleavage and two N2  formation pathways of intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular coupling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirmed that C&#8208;N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for encouraging N2  production by 2&#8208;folds. These findings provide complementary insights into the nitrogen fate in water&#8208;energy nexus systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Urea electrolysis is a prospective technology for simultaneous H2  production and nitrogen abatement toward water-energy nexus. Its sustainability is currently founded on the innocuous N2  products; however, herein, we discovered the prevalent nickel-based catalysts could generally over-oxidize urea into NO2-  products with ~80% Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazard to the environment. Trace amounts of over-oxidized NO3-  and N2O were also detected. By  15N isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen fate network, involving a NO2-  formation pathway  via  OH--assisted C-N cleavage and two N2  formation pathways of intra- and inter-molecular coupling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirmed that C-N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for encouraging N2  production by 2-folds.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework derived CuxOyCz Catalyst for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and Impact of Local pH Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nanostructured CuxOyCz electrocatalysts were synthesized from Cu&#8208;based MOF precursors. The catalysts were blended with PTFE for preparation of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to suppress hydrogen evolution by preventing electrowetting process. The local OH&#8722; ion activities of working GDEs were determined in absence and presence of PTFE to exclude interference in local OH&#8722; ion generation in the vicinity of GDE by PTFE.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to produce value&#8208;added chemicals has been intensively pursued. We report a series of CuxOyCz nanostructured electrocatalysts derived from a Cu&#8208;based MOF as porous self&#8208;sacrificial template. Blending catalysts with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. 25 to 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% teflonized GDEs exhibited a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;54&#8201;% for C2+ products at &#8722;80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The local OH&#8722; ions activity of PTFE&#8208;modified GDEs was assessed by means of closely positioning a Pt&#8208;nanoelectrode. A substantial increase in the OH&#8722;/H2O activity ratio due to the locally generated OH&#8722; ions at increasing current densities was determined irrespective of the PTFE amount.

         <title>An Air&#8208; and Water&#8208;Stable B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Serving as a Host Material for a Phosphorescent OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene (see structure) featuring a large HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap was synthesized and found to exhibit excellent thermal and chemical stability. The compound has a high T1 energy and can therefore emit short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence comparable to that of benzene. Owing to its photophysical properties, the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene served as a good host material for a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Replacement of the carbon&#8211;carbon bonds of antiaromatic compounds with polar boron&#8211;nitrogen bonds often provides isoelectronic BN compounds with excellent thermodynamic stability and interesting photophysical properties. By this element&#8208;substitution strategy, we synthesized a new B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene derivative, 1, which is fully substituted with mesityl groups. Owing to kinetic protection by the sterically bulky substituents, 1 is remarkably stable toward air and even water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 revealed the bonding characteristics of the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene structure. In a glassy matrix, 1 emitted short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with an onset at 350&#8197;nm, indicating that the triplet energy is substantially high. DFT calculations reasonably explained the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state electronic structures of 1 as well as its emission properties. Motivated by the high&#8208;energy triplet state of 1, we used it as a host material to fabricate a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 15&#8201;%.

         <title>Single Particle Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals the Catalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Co3O4 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SECCM and the single&#8208;particle&#8208;at&#8208;the&#8208;tip approach are allied to gain insight into the activity of individual Co3O4 nanocube particles towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The single&#8208;particle&#8208;at&#8208;the&#8208;tip approach offers the ability to perform accelerated stress tests combined with HR&#8208;TEM to observe structural changes of the nanoparticle during electrocatalysis at high current densities.







Abstract
Co3O4 nanocubes are evaluated concerning their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by means of single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) provides data on the electrocatalytic OER activity from several individual measurement areas covering one Co3O4 nanocube of a comparatively high number of individual particles with sufficient statistical reproducibility. Single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;nanoelectrode measurements of Co3O4 nanocubes provide an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.92&#8197;V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such high current densities combined with identical&#8208;location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer during electrocatalysis. Combining two independent single&#8208;entity electrochemistry techniques provides the basis for elucidating structure&#8211;activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well&#8208;defined surface structure.

         <title>Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Lipooligosaccharide Antigen from the Opportunistic Pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOS), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS (2) from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly. This report describes the first syntheses related to M. kansasii LOSs and 2 is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations</dc:description>

         <title>Rotation in an Enantiospecific Self&#8208;Assembled Array of Molecular Raffle Wheels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored nano&#8208;spaces can control enantioselective adsorption and molecular motion. We report on the spontaneous assembly of a dynamic one&#8208;component system &#8212; a rigid kagome network with each pore occupied by a guest molecule &#8212; employing solely 2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid on Ag(111). The network cavity snugly hosts the guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature&#8208;dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95 eV thermal barrier. H&#8208;bonding between the guest and the host transiently stabilizes the rotating guest, as the flapper on a raffle wheel. Density functional theory investigations unravel the detailed molecular pirouette of the guest and how the energy landscape is determined by H&#8208;bond formation and breakage. The origin of the guest&#8217;s enantiodirected, dynamic anchoring lies in the specific interplay of the kagome network and the silver surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Water State during Lipidic Mesophases Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the static and dynamic states of water network during the phase transitions from double gyroid (Ia3d) to double diamond (Pn m) bicontinuous cubic phases and from the latter to the reverse hexagonal (HII) phase in monolinolein based lipidic mesophases by combining FTIR and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). In both cubic(s) and&#160;HII&#160;phase, two dynamically different fractions of water are detected and attributed to the bound and the interstitial free water. The dynamics of the two water fractions are all slower than bulk water due to the hydrogen&#8208;bonds between water molecules and the lipid&#8217;s polar headgroups and to nanoconfinement. Both FTIR and BDS results suggest that a larger fraction of water is bonded to the headgroup of lipids in&#160;HII&#160;phase at higher temperature than in cubic phase at lower temperature via H&#8208;bonds, which is different from the common expectation that the H&#8208;bonds should decrease with increase of temperature. These findings are rationalized by considering the topological ratio of interface/volume of the two mesophases.</dc:description>

         <title>Strongly Coupled Cobalt Diselenide Monolayers Selectively Catalyze Oxygen Reduction to H2O2 in an Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the acidic environment could largely prevent its decomposition to water, but efficient catalysts that constitute entirely earth&#8208;abundant elements are lacking. Here we report the experimental demonstration of narrowing the interlayer gap of metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2), which creates high&#8208;performance catalyst to selectively drive two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction toward H2O2 in an acidic electrolyte. The enhancement of the interlayer coupling between CoSe2 atomic layers offers a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the critical *OOH adsorption, promoting the energetics for H2O2 production. Consequently, on the strongly coupled CoSe2 catalyst, we achieved Faradaic efficiency of 96.7%, current density of 50.04 milliamperes per square centimeter, and product rate of 30.60 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1. Moreover, this catalyst shows no sign of degradation when operating at &#8208;63 milliamperes per square centimeter over 100 hours</dc:description>

         <title>Studying conversion mechanism to broaden cathode options in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries benefiting from both improved safety and environmental impact in addition to being easy to manufacture at scale. The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn&#8208;ion storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn&#8208;ion intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn&#8208;ion intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7 mA h g&#8208;1) and Cu2O (374.5 mA h g&#8208;1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn&#8208;ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed s&#8208;Block Magnesium Sites for Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed transition metal sites have been extensively studied for CO  2  electroredution reaction (CO  2  RR) to CO due to their robust CO  2  activation ability. However, the strong hybridization between directionally localized d orbits and CO vastly limits CO desorption and thus the activities of atomically d ispersed transition metal sites. In contrast, s&#8208;block metal sites possess nondirectional ly delocalized 3s orbits and hence weak CO adsorption ability, providing a promising way to solve the suffered CO desorption issue. Herein , we constructed atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitic carbon nitride ( Mg&#8208;C  3  N  4  ) through a facile heat treatment for CO  2  RR . Theoretical calculations show that the CO desorption on Mg sites is easier than that on Fe and Co sites. This theoretical prediction is demonstrated by experimental CO temperature program desorption and  in&#8208;situ  attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. As a result, Mg&#8208;C  3  N  4  exhibits a high turnover frequency of&#160;~ 18,000 per hour in H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8208;300 mA/cm  2  in flow cell , under a high CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90% in KHCO  3  electrolyte . This work sheds a new light on s&#8208;block metal sites for efficient CO  2  RR to CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Fe&#8208;spin State Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe  1  &#8208;NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure&#8208;function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)&#8208;doped Fe  1  &#8208;NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe&#8208;NC materials.  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe  1  &#8208;NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin&#160; single&#8208;Fe  3+  &#8208;atom of C&#8208;FeN  4  &#8208;S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe  1  &#8208;NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin&#8208;state&#8208;determined ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>APEX2&#8208;based Proximity Labeling of Atox1 Identifies CRIP2 as a Nuclear Copper&#8208;binding Protein that Regulates Autophagy Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian cell nuclei contain copper, and cancer cells are known to accumulate aberrantly high copper levels, yet the mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation and copper&#8217;s broader functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, by combining APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling focused on the copper chaperone Atox1 with mass spectrometry we identified a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein, Cysteine&#8208;rich protein 2 (CRIP2), that interacts with Atox1 in the nucleus. We show that Atox1 transfers copper to CRIP2, which induces a change in CRIP2&#8217;s secondary structure that ultimately promotes its ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of CRIP2&#8212;as well as copper&#8208;induced CRIP2 degradation&#8212;elevates ROS levels and activates autophagy in H1299 cells. Thus, our study establishes that CRIP2 as an autophagic suppressor protein and implicates CRIP2&#8208;mediated copper metabolism in the activation of autophagy in cancer cells.</dc:description>

Ruthenium&#8208;NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones to simple 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones has been developed with high yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Direct enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds to generate chiral three&#8208;dimensional motifs is one of the most straightforward and important approaches in synthetic chemistry. We realized the Ru(II)&#8208;NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild reaction conditions. Alkyl&#8208;, aryl&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted optically active dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones were obtained in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The reaction provides an efficient and atom&#8208;economic pathway to construct simple chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones. The desired products could be further reduced to tetrahydroquinolines and octahydroquinolones.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Cell Membrane Phase Separation for Improved Peptide Drug Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic peptides have been widely concerned because of their good biocompatibility, but their efficacy is limited by the inability to penetrate cell membranes, which is a key bottleneck in peptide drugs delivery. Herein, an  in vivo  self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization and anticancer efficacy. A phosphopeptide KYp is synthesized, containing an anticancer peptide [KLAKLAK]  2  (K) and a responsive moiety phosphorylated Y (Yp). After interacting with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on the cell membrane, KYp can be dephosphorylated and self&#8208;assembles  in situ  , which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation on the cell membrane. ALP is involved in the assembly of peptides, forming the large aggregates and entering cells, which leads to the enhanced permeability of cell membrane. Consequently, the peptide drugs internalization is ~2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide nanoparticle, and IC  50  value of KYp is approximately ~5 times lower than that of free peptide. Finally, the tumor of mice treated with KYp is suppressed effectively, showing the negligible side effect  in vivo  . Therefore, the  in vivo  self&#8208;assembly induced phase separation on the cell membrane promises a new strategy to improve the drug delivery efficacy in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Zwitterionic Heterobimetallic Gold&#8211;Iron Complex Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine)Silyliumylidene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of a silyliumylidene&#8208;stabilized mononuclear Au&#8722;Fe complex, by a convenient one&#8208;pot reaction starting from bis&#8208;NHI silyliumylidene chloride, is reported. X&#8208;ray crystallography, IR and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, as well as computations suggest a zwitterionic Si(II)+&#8722;Au(I)+&#8722;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8722; bonding motif with rare anagostic CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au contacts and considerable backbonding capabilities of the silyliumylidene.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of the first bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic imine&#8208;stabilized chlorosilyliumylidene 1 is reported. Remarkably, consecutive reaction of 1 with PPh3AuCl and K2Fe(CO)4 gives rise to the unique heterobimetallic complex 1,2&#8208;(MesNHI)2&#8208;C2H4&#8208;ClSiAuFe(CO)4 (4). The overall neutral complex 4 bears an unusual linear Si&#8722;Au&#8722;Fe structure and a rare anagostic interaction between the d10&#8208;configured gold atom and a CH bond of the mesityl ligand. According to the computational analysis and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, the formal Fe&#8208;oxidation state remains at &#8722;II. Thus, the electronic structure of 4 is best described as an overall neutral&#8212;yet zwitterionic&#8212;heterobimetallic &#8220;Si(II)+&#8208;Au(I)+&#8208;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8722;&#8221;&#8208;silyliumylidene complex, derived from double anion exchange. The computational analysis indicates strong hyperconjugative back donation from the gold(I) atom to the silyliumylidene ligand.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Dominated Stable N97 Respirators for Airborne Virus Capture Based on Nanofibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity&#8208;driven air filtration approach is achieved based on the thin&#8208;film coated PAN nanofibrous membranes (TFPNMs), possessing a superior filtration efficiency reaching to N97 grade with outstanding longevity and reusability compared with the N95 FFRs. The TFPNMs can be reused upon various disinfection treatments, giving great potential for personal health care.







Abstract
The longevity and reusability of N95&#8208;grade filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) are limited by consecutive donning and disinfection treatments. Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin&#8208;film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long&#8208;lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42&#8197;Pa&#8722;1 (filtration efficiency: over 97&#8201;%; pressure drop: around 10&#8197;Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10&#8211;0.41&#8197;Pa&#8722;1) tested with a flow rate of 5&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1 and the 0.26&#8197;&#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67&#8201;%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.

         <title>Anodic Dehydrogenative Cyanamidation of Thioethers: Simple and Sustainable Synthesis of N&#8208;Cyanosulfilimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, robust and scalable electrochemical route for synthesis of N&#8208;cyanosulfilimines is described. The reaction provides good to excellent yields for dialkyl and alkylaryl sulfilimines. Compared to established routes no external oxidizers or strong bases are required. The synthesis provides access to biologically relevant sulfoximines by further oxidation using electro&#8208;generated periodate.







Abstract
A novel and very simple to perform electrochemical approach for the synthesis of several N&#8208;cyanosulfilimines in good to excellent yields was established. This method provides access to biologically relevant sulfoximines by consecutive oxidation using electro&#8208;generated periodate. This route can be easily scaled&#8208;up to gram quantities. The S,N coupling is carried out at an inexpensive carbon anode by direct oxidation of sulfide. Therefore, the designed process is atom economic and represents a new &#8220;green route&#8221; for the synthesis of sulfilimines and sulfoximines.

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Red Laser with a Single Longitudinal Mode from Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Miniaturized solid&#8208;state lasers with a single longitudinal mode are vital for various photonic applications. Here we prepare red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 65.5% by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. High&#8208;concentration doping alters the CDs&#8217; emission from blue to red, while the electron&#8208;donating groups and polymer coating on their surfaces improve the PLQY and photostability. The CDs exhibit excellent stimulated emission characteristics, with a low threshold of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and long gain lifetime. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; ASE peak, was constructed. Combining the CDs and microcavity produced a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14 nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8 dB. Our results will aid the development of colorful solid&#8208;state micro/nano lasers with potential use in practical photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Using stereochemistry to control mechanical properties in thiol&#8208;yne click&#8208;hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of polymers has a profound impact on their mechanical properties. While this has been observed in thermoplastics, studies on how stereochemistry affects the bulk properties of swollen networks, such as hydrogels, are limited. Typically, changing the stiffness of a hydrogel is achieved at the cost of changing another parameter, that in turn affects the physical properties of the material and ultimately influences the cellular response. Herein, we report that by manipulating the stereochemistry of a double bond, formed in situ during gelation, materials with diverse mechanical properties but comparable physical properties can be obtained. Click&#8208;hydrogels that possess a high %  trans  content are stiffer than their high %  cis  analogues by almost a factor of 3. Human mesenchymal stem cells acted as a substrate stiffness cell reporter demonstrating the potential of these platforms to study mechanotransduction without the influence of other external factors.</dc:description>

         <title>Irradiation&#8208;Wavelength Directing Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Enabled by Hydrogen Bonded Chiral Fluorescent Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch&#160;1&#160;and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch&#160;2&#160;, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible&#160;Z/E&#160;photoisomerization irradiated with 450 nm blue and 365 nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. Interestingly, in contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch&#160;2, exposure of the system incorporating switch&#160;1&#160;to 365 nm and 450 nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding was demonstrated using the system containing switch&#160;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Photoexcitation of Ethynylbenziodoxolones: An Alternative to Photocatalysis for Alkynylation Reactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl ethynylbenziodoxolones (ArEBXs) can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. In the excited state, ArEBXs act as strong oxidants, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides, and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs) are commonly used as radical traps in photocatalytic alkynylations. Herein, we report that aryl&#8208;substituted EBX reagents can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. They act as both oxidants and radical traps, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in several reported EBX&#8208;mediated processes, including decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF. Furthermore, the method could be applied to the synthesis of alkynylated quaternary centers from tertiary alcohols via stable oxalate salts and from tertiary amines via aryl imines. A photocatalytic process using 4CzIPN as an organic dye was also developed for the deoxyalkynylation of oxalates.

         <title>A TiO2&#8208;Co(terpyridine)2 Photocatalyst for the Selective Oxidation of Cellulose to Formate Coupled to the Reduction of CO2 to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocatalyst consisting of a phosphonated cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst immobilized on TiO2 powder allows coupling of aqueous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (CO and H2) reduction with the selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates or cellulose to formate. Thus, the simultaneous conversion of two waste streams into sustainable chemicals using sunlight is demonstrated.







Abstract
Immobilization of a phosphonated cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst on TiO2 nanoparticles generates a photocatalyst that allows coupling aqueous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (CO and H2) reduction to selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates or cellulose to formate. An enzymatic saccharification pre&#8208;treatment process is employed that enables the use of insoluble cellulose as an electron&#8208;donating substrate under benign aqueous conditions suitable for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. The hybrid photocatalyst consists of solely earth&#8208;abundant components, and its heterogeneous nature allows for reuse and operation in aqueous solution for several days at 25&#8201;&#176;C, reaching a cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion yield of 17&#8201;%. Thus, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for valorizing two waste streams (CO2 and biomass) simultaneously into value&#8208;added chemicals through solar&#8208;driven catalysis is demonstrated.

         <title>Subsurface&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Induced Local Charge of Copper for an On&#8208;Surface Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By subsurface doping with carbon, local charge is introduced to the surface Cu atoms of Cu(111), which enables an instant on&#8208;surface displacement reaction. The well&#8208;defined and robust Cu&#948;+ surface offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis. The strategy based on subsurface doping with non&#8208;metal atoms provides an efficient path to improve the catalytic performance of the parent metal.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal carbides have sparked unprecedented enthusiasm as high&#8208;performance catalysts in recent years. Still, the catalytic properties of copper carbide remain unexplored. By introducing subsurface carbon to Cu(111), a displacement reaction of a proton in a carboxyl acid group with a single Cu atom is demonstrated at the atomic scale and room temperature. Its occurrence is attributed to the C&#8208;doping&#8208;induced local charge of surface Cu atoms (up to +0.30&#8197;e/atom), which accelerates the rate of on&#8208;surface deprotonation via reduction of the corresponding energy barrier, thus enabling the instant displacement of a proton with a Cu atom when the molecules adsorb on the surface. This well&#8208;defined and robust Cu&#948;+ surface based on subsurface&#8208;carbon doping offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis.

A continuous flow platform that is able to concatenate multiple steps for rapid, multi&#8208;gram production of orthogonally protected deoxy&#8208;sugars is described. Intermediate purification of compounds is avoided by the ability to run telescoped sequences of 2&#8211;4 chemical transformations. Through the use of Mechwolf, an open&#8208;source, Python&#8208;controlled program, automation of the flow processes was achieved.







Abstract
An automated continuous flow system capable of producing protected deoxy&#8208;sugar donors from commercial material is described. Four 2,6&#8208;dideoxy and two 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy sugars with orthogonal protecting groups were synthesized in 11&#8211;32&#8201;% overall yields in 74&#8211;131.5&#8197;minutes of total reaction time. Several of the reactions were able to be concatenated into a continuous process, avoiding the need for chromatographic purification of intermediates. The modular nature of the experimental setup allowed for reaction streams to be split into different lines for the parallel synthesis of multiple donors. Further, the continuous flow processes were fully automated and described through the design of an open&#8208;source Python&#8208;controlled automation platform.

         <title>Interfacial Linkage and Carbon Encapsulation Enable Full Solution&#8208;Printed Perovskite Photovoltaics with Prolonged Lifespan</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple amphiphilic silane interfacial linkage strategy was employed to realize fully&#8208;printed all carbon&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a high efficiency of 18.64&#8201;%, accompanied by excellent device stability over 3000 hours.







Abstract
Simplified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with the perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) by a fully blade&#8208;coated process. A self&#8208;assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage. The AS serves as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221; to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, facilitating the interfacial charge extraction, increasing PCEs by 77&#8201;% and reducing hysteresis. A PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was achieved for the fully printed devices, one of the highest reported for carbon&#8208;based PSCs. AS&#8208;assisted interfacial linkage and carbon&#8208;material&#8208;assisted self&#8208;encapsulation enhance the stability of the PSCs, which did not experience performance degradation when stored at ambient conditions for over 3000&#8197;h.

         <title>A Desolvation&#8208;Free Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Chemistry for High Power Density and Extremely Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery was fabricated by combining reversible anion doping in a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode and co&#8208;intercalation of a Na+&#8208;solvent complex in an artificial graphite (AG) anode, which demonstrates super&#8208;fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (100C&#8208;rate) at 25&#8201;&#176;C, maintaining 61&#8201;% at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C compared to its room&#8208;temperature capacity.







Abstract
The development of conventional rechargeable batteries based on intercalation chemistry in the fields of fast charge and low temperature is generally hindered by the sluggish cation&#8208;desolvation process at the electrolyte/electrode interphase. To address this issue, a novel desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery (SDIB) has been proposed by using artificial graphite (AG) as anode and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as cathode. Combining the cation solvent co&#8208;intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether&#8208;based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (corresponding to 100C&#8208;rate) with a high capacity retention of 45&#8201;%. Moreover, the desolvation&#8208;free mechanism endows the battery with 61&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This advanced battery system will open a door for designing energy storage devices that require high power density and a wide operational temperature range.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Reverse Intersystem Crossing and Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophors with Multiple Through&#8208;space Charge Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescent molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8211;acceptor motif are constructed to realize both fast radiative decay and reverse intersystem crossing, thanks to the enhanced multiple&#8208;charge transfers and near&#8208;degenerate excited states. The optimized device exhibits narrow&#8208;band green electroluminescence with a EQEmax/CIEy of 31.6&#8201;%/0.69, being the purest green bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with through&#8208;space charge transfers (CT) have attracted particularly interest recently. However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative decay always limit their electroluminescence performances. Herein, TADF molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8208;acceptor (ortho&#8208;Dn&#8208;A) motif are developed to create near&#8208;degenerate excited states for the reinforcement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The incorporation of both through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space CT enlarges oscillator strength. The optimal ortho&#8208;D3&#8208;A compound exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of ca. 100&#8201;%, a high RISC rate of 2.57&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a high radiative decay rate of 1.00&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously. With this compound as the sensitizer, a TADF&#8208;sensitized&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.6&#8201;% with an ultrapure green Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinate value of 0.69.

         <title>The Structure of Cyclodecatriene Collinolactone, its Biosynthesis, and Semisynthetic Analogues: Effects of Monoastral Phenotype and Protection from Intracellular Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collinolactone shares the same carbon scaffold with rhizolutin and X&#8208;ray crystallography has provided the absolute configuration. A highly non&#8208;collinear gene cluster was identified. Studies of cell viability using fluorescence microscopy revealed that analogues of collinolactone induce the formation of a monopolar spindle phenotype while collinolactone showed neuroprotective effects by reducing intracellular oxidative stress.







Abstract
Recently described rhizolutin and collinolactone isolated from Streptomyces G&#246;&#8197;40/10 share the same novel carbon scaffold. Analyses by NMR and X&#8208;Ray crystallography verify the structure of collinolactone and propose a revision of rhizolutin's stereochemistry. Isotope&#8208;labeled precursor feeding shows that collinolactone is biosynthesized via type&#8197;I polyketide synthase with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation. CRISPR&#8208;based genetic strategies led to the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and a high&#8208;production strain. Chemical semisyntheses yielded collinolactone analogues with inhibitory effects on L929 cell line. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that only particular analogues induce monopolar spindles impairing cell division in mitosis. Inspired by the Alzheimer&#8208;protective activity of rhizolutin, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of collinolactone and its analogues on glutamate&#8208;sensitive cells (HT22) and indeed, natural collinolactone displays distinct neuroprotection from intracellular oxidative stress.

         <title>Unraveling a Ligand&#8208;Induced Twist of a Homodimeric Enzyme by Pulsed Electron&#8211;Electron Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance spectroscopy (PELDOR or DEER), an equilibrium was observed between the functional and the twisted dimer of the enzyme tRNA&#8208;guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a virulence&#8208;relevant target of shigellosis, which depends on the chemical structure of the bound ligand. The experiments suggest a dissociation&#8211;association mechanism for the formation of the twisted dimer.







Abstract
Mechanistic insights into protein&#8211;ligand interactions can yield chemical tools for modulating protein function and enable their use for therapeutic purposes. For the homodimeric enzyme tRNA&#8208;guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a putative virulence target of shigellosis, ligand binding has been shown by crystallography to transform the functional dimer geometry into an incompetent twisted one. However, crystallographic observation of both end states does neither verify the ligand&#8208;induced transformation of one dimer into the other in solution nor does it shed light on the underlying transformation mechanism. We addressed these questions in an approach that combines site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL) with distance measurements based on pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance (PELDOR or DEER) spectroscopy. We observed an equilibrium between the functional and twisted dimer that depends on the type of ligand, with a pyranose&#8208;substituted ligand being the most potent one in shifting the equilibrium toward the twisted dimer. Our experiments suggest a dissociation&#8211;association mechanism for the formation of the twisted dimer upon ligand binding.

         <title>The Reaction of CO2 with a Borylnitrene: Formation of an 3&#8208;Oxaziridinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet borylnitrene 1 reacts photochemically (&#955;&gt;550&#8197;nm) under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions with CO2, which is known for its high thermodynamic and kinetic stability, to give a strained and unprecedented 3&#8208;oxaziridinone motif 2.







Abstract
The reaction of a borylnitrene with carbon dioxide is studied under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions. Photogenerated CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with CO2 under formation of the cycloaddition product CatBNCO2, a 3&#8208;oxaziridinone derivative, after photoexcitation (&gt;550&#8197;nm). The product shows Fermi resonances between the CO stretching and ring deformation modes that cause unusual 13C and 18O isotopic shifts. A computational analysis of the 3&#8208;oxaziridinone shows this cyclic carbamate to be less strained than an &#945;&#8208;lactone or an &#945;&#8208;lactame.

Photogenerated CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under formation of the cycloaddition product CatBNCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a 3-oxaziridinone derivative, after photoexcitation (&amp;gt;550&#8197;nm). The product shows Fermi resonances between the CO stretching and ring deformation modes that cause unusual &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotopic shifts. A computational analysis of the 3-oxaziridinone shows this cyclic carbamate to be less strained than an &#945;-lactone or an &#945;-lactame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Tailored Active Site Proximity for the Efficient Production of Pentanoic Biofuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolite&#8208;tailored active site proximity, with well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm) confined within the internal cavities of zeolite&#8197;Y, significantly boosts the catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct hydrodeoxygenation of neat ethyl levulinate into pentanoic biofuels. Furthermore, La modification for zeolite&#8197;Y could improve the metal dispersion and the stability of zeolite during catalysis.







Abstract
Biofuel production can alleviate reliance on fossil resources and thus carbon dioxide emission. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru metal nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite&#8197;Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one&#8208;pot HDO of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. We have established and extended an understanding of the &#8220;intimacy criterion&#8221; in catalytic biomass valorization. These findings bring new understanding of HDO reactions over confined proximity sites, leading to potential application for pentanoic biofuels in biomass conversion.

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a TbIII&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of TbIII in Ln&#8208;MOFs led to turn&#8208;on sensing of organic analytes regardless of quenching oscillators. The presence of such a remote interaction mechanism during the turn&#8208;on sensing event was verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and molecular dynamic modelling investigations.







Abstract
Guided by a second&#8208;sphere interaction strategy, we fabricated a Tb(III)&#8208;based metal&#8212;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for turn&#8208;on sensing of methyl amine with ultra&#8208;low detection limit and high turn&#8208;on efficiency. MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with secondary coordination spheres that are densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Nonradiative routes were inhibited by binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand on the second coordination sphere, resulting in luminescence amplification. Such remote interacting mechanism involved in the turn&#8208;on sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamic simulation studies. The design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb(III) enabled the first turn&#8208;on sensing of organic amines in aqueous conditions. Our work suggests a promising strategy for high&#8208;performance turn&#8208;on sensing for Ln&#8208;MOFs and luminous materials driven by other metal chromophores.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of the 6,10&#8208;Bicyclic Eunicellane Skeleton by the Bacterial Diterpene Synthase Bnd4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic and mechanistic characterization of Bnd4, a bacterial diterpene synthase and the first terpene synthase known to form the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic eunicellane skeleton. Isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the cyclization mechanism for benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene. An unusual DNxxxD motif was found to be essential for cyclization activity.







Abstract
The eunicellane diterpenoids are a unique family of natural products seen in marine organisms, plants, and bacteria. We used a series of biochemical, bioinformatics, and theoretical experiments to investigate the mechanism of the first diterpene synthase known to form the eunicellane skeleton. Deuterium labeling studies and quantum chemical calculations support that Bnd4, from Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4), forms the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic skeleton through a 1,10&#8208;cyclization, 1,3&#8208;hydride shift, and 1,14&#8208;cyclization cascade. Bnd4 also demonstrated sesquiterpene cyclase activity and the ability to prenylate small molecules. Bnd4 possesses a unique D94NxxxD motif and mutation experiments confirmed an absolute requirement for D94 as well as E169.

         <title>A Heteromeric Carboxylic Acid Based Single&#8208;Crystalline Crosslinked Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework was synthesized through heteromeric monomers co&#8208;crystallization followed by thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking. The crosslinked porous crystals featured large pores to host a hydrazone switch for solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;patterning.







Abstract
The development of large pore single&#8208;crystalline covalently linked organic frameworks is critical in revealing the detailed structure&#8208;property relationship with substrates. One emergent approach is to photo&#8208;crosslink hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular crystals. Introducing complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonded carboxylic acid building blocks is promising to construct large pore networks, but these molecules often form interpenetrated networks or non&#8208;porous solids. Herein, we introduced heteromeric carboxylic acid dimers to construct a non&#8208;interpenetrated molecular crystal. Crosslinking this crystal precursor with dithiols afforded a large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework HCOF&#8208;101. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed HCOF&#8208;101 as an interlayer connected hexagonal network, which possesses flexible linkages and large porous channels to host a hydrazone photoswitch. Multicycle Z/E&#8208;isomerization of the hydrazone took place reversibly within HCOF&#8208;101, showcasing the potential use of HCOF&#8208;101 for optical information storage.

         <title>Catalytic Carbochlorocarbonylation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons via C&#8722;COCl Bond Cleavage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a catalytic system comprised of Pd and Xantphos, acid chlorides can be added across strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to form two new C&#8722;C bonds via formal C&#8722;COCl cleavage. This reaction allows for a dicarbofunctionalisation in which an acid chloride group is retained in the product. DFT studies are used to rationalise a plausible pathway, while product derivatisation highlights the synthetic utility of the method.







Abstract
Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8722;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or a tethered alkyne to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride in situ. The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.

         <title>Rational Design of Sustainable Liquid Microcapsules for Spontaneous Fragrance Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a PEG&#8208;g&#8208;PVAc amphiphilic graft copolymer together with hydrophobic fragrances in aqueous medium leads to the spontaneous formation of colloidally stable suspensions of liquid coacervate droplets. Arrows indicate the local turbulences sustaining the spontaneous mixing of the components. The bottom panel shows the confocal Raman microspectroscopy mapping of a multicompartment coacervate droplet with carvone as fragrance.







Abstract
The high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. Herein, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.

         <title>Synthesis of Mixed&#8208;Valent Lanthanide Sulfide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4; and EuS, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4 were prepared. The phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.







Abstract
In targeting reduced valent lanthanide chalcogenides, we report the first nanoparticle synthesis of the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4. Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, we prepared nanoparticles of EuS, Eu3S4, EuSm2S4, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4. All nanoparticle phases were identified using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm morphology and nanoparticle size, and magnetic susceptibility measurements for determining the ordering temperatures and valence. The UV/Vis, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies for each phase were compared. Surprisingly, the phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O into CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO&#8208;66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS2 sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allows photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O into CH3COOH and O2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2 reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2 nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2 composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH3COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2 for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.

         <title>Discovery and Characterisation of Highly Cooperative FAK&#8208;Degrading PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PROTAC with an unusually short linker potently degrades focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SPR and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly cooperative FAK&#8208;PROTAC&#8208;VCB ternary complex, and FAK degradation showed enhanced effects on 3D cell growth compared to FAK inhibitors. In mice, GSK215 induced rapid and sustained degradation of FAK with a profound PK/PD disconnect.







Abstract
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK&#8208;GSK215&#8208;VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in&#8208;vitro pharmacology compared to VS&#8208;4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long&#8208;lasting effect on FAK levels (&#8776;96&#8197;h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK&#8208;degradation biology in&#8197;vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.

&lt;p&gt;A PROTAC with an unusually short linker potently degrades focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SPR and X-ray crystallography revealed a highly cooperative FAK-PROTAC-VCB ternary complex, and FAK degradation showed enhanced effects on 3D cell growth compared to FAK inhibitors. In mice, GSK215 induced rapid and sustained degradation of FAK with a profound PK/PD disconnect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK-degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS-4718. X-ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK-GSK215-VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in-vitro pharmacology compared to VS-4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long-lasting effect on FAK levels (&#8776;96&#8197;h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK-degradation biology in&#8197;vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cross&#8208;coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with alkylamine and aldehyde feedstocks has been achieved. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained with generally good yields and optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible with excellent stereocontrol. This method provides a novel disconnection strategy for the synthesis of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes that utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.

         <title>Biocatalytic C3&#8208;Indole Methylation&#8212;A Useful Tool for the Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired Stereoselective Synthesis of Pyrroloindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the promiscuous C3&#8208;indole methyl transferase PsmD enabled the enantioselective synthesis of various pyrroloindolines. By additionally applying the halo methyl transferase CtHMT not only the expensive SAM cofactor could be recycled, but also the enzymatic preparative scale transformation was achieved.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds bearing a pyrroloindole framework is often laborious. In contrast, there are several S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyl transferases known for stereo&#8208; and regioselective methylation at the C3 position of various indoles, directly leading to the formation of the desired pyrroloindole moiety. Herein, the SAM&#8208;dependent methyl transferase PsmD from Streptomyces griseofuscus, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, is characterized in detail. The biochemical properties of PsmD and its substrate scope were demonstrated. Preparative scale enzymatic methylation including SAM regeneration was achieved for three selected substrates after a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiment optimization.

         <title>Sustainable Pd(OAc)2/Hydroquinone Cocatalyst System for Cis&#8208;Selective Dibenzoyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and scalable cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocol that employs catalytic hydroquinone with tBuOOH as a benign terminal oxidant. A bromide additive was crucial to obtaining good yields and excellent cis selectivity. The study culminates in the implementation of the optimized reaction on large scale.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;diacyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO2, which limit process sustainability and large&#8208;scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from trans to cis diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high cis selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>A Copper(I) Complex with Two Unpaired Electrons, Synthesised by Oxidation of a Copper(II) Complex with Two Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation&#8208;induced reduction: The oxidation of mononuclear CuII complexes with novel unsymmetric redox&#8208;active urea azine or thio&#8208;urea azine ligands leads to metal reduction and formation of complexes with intriguing electronic structures. The stability in several redox states is the basis for their first application in catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Two homoleptic copper(II) complexes [Cu(L1)2] and [Cu(L2)2] with anionic redox&#8208;active ligands were synthesised, one with urea azine (L1) and the other with thio&#8208;urea azine (L2) ligands. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox&#8208;induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)2]+ and [Cu(L2)2]+ with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)2]+ is best described as a CuI complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)2]+ is a CuI complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)2]2+, best described as a CuI complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile ligand&#8208;metal electron transfer make these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.

         <title>Li2MTeO6 (M=Ti, Sn): Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Wide Transparency Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New tellurate LTT and LST crystals were obtained by a TSSG method with a broad transparent region of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m for MIR NLO applications. Both LTT and LST belong to the space group Pnn2, with an almost identical structure. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder SHG response. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder SHG based on the crystal structures.







Abstract
Oxide crystals have been widely used in nonlinear optics (NLO) in the ultraviolet&#8211;visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Most traditional oxide crystals are restricted to the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their narrow transmission window. Hence, attempting to extend infrared cutoff wavelength of oxides has attracted much attention. Herein, we report two new tellurates Li2TiTeO6 (LTT) and Li2SnTeO6 (LST) with broad transparent regions of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, as excellent candidates for mid&#8208;infrared NLO applications. Both LTT and LST crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnn2. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder second&#8208;order generation efficiency (26&#215;KDP) under the fundamental wavelength of 1064&#8197;nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder second&#8208;harmonic generations based on the crystal structures. Our results provide a novel oxide NLO crystal with a strong SHG and wide transparency range. They also pave a way for the design of new oxide mid&#8208;IR NLO crystals.

         <title>PtSe2/Pt Heterointerface with Reduced Coordination for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small Pt particles are generated in situ on the surface of PtSe2 nanosheet with Se vacancies for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
PtSe2 is a typical noble metal dichalcogenide (NMD) that holds promising possibility for next&#8208;generation electronics and photonics. However, when applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it exhibits sluggish kinetics due to the insufficient capability of absorbing active species. Here, we construct PtSe2/Pt heterointerface to boost the reaction dynamics of PtSe2, enabled by an in situ electrochemical method. It is found that Se vacancies are induced around the heterointerface, reducing the coordination environment. Correspondingly, the exposed Pt atoms at the very vicinity of Se vacancies are activated, with enhanced overlap with H 1s orbital. The adsorption of H. intermediate is thus strengthened, achieving near thermoneutral free energy change. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2/Pt exhibits extraordinary HER activity even superior to Pt/C, with an overpotential of 42&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work raises attention on NMDs toward HER and provides insights for the rational construction of novel heterointerfaces.

         <title>Designing Anion&#8208;Type Water&#8208;Free Zn2+ Solvation Structure for Robust Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free Zn2+ solvation structure electrolyte for developing a Zn metal anode. The chloride salt with bulky cations unlocks the Zn2+&#8208;water interactions, and a new solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722; is formed without bound water. Owing to the limited hydrogen evolution reaction and the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and anion, the electrolyte shows an average Zn plating/stripping CE of &#8776;99.9&#8201;% and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries are potential for large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage due to their low cost and high security. However, Zn metal anode suffers from the dendritic growth and interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in the deterioration of electrode/battery performance. Here we propose that both dendrites and HER are related to the water participated Zn2+ solvation structure&#8208;Zn(H2O)62+ and thus can be resolved by transforming Zn(H2O)62+ to an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722;, which is achieved in traditional ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte after adding chloride salt with a bulky cation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). The elimination of cation&#8208;water interaction suppresses HER, while the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and the anion solvation structure inhibits dendrite formation. As a result, the electrolyte shows uniform Zn deposition with an average Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.9&#8201;%, enabling a capacity retention of 78.8&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles in anode&#8208;free Zn batteries with pre&#8208;zincificated polyaniline as the cathode. This work provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to prevent HER and realize long&#8208;lifespan metal anode.

         <title>Selective Detection of Cu+ Ions in Live Cells via Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a new fluorescent probe that upon binding to copper(I) (but not any other physiologically relevant metal ions), displays an intensity switch&#8208;on as well as a significant change in its fluorescence lifetime. The later has allowed us to visualize copper(I) in live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.







Abstract
Copper is an essential trace element in living organisms with its levels and localisation being carefully managed by the cellular machinery. However, if misregulated, deficiency or excess of copper ions can lead to several diseases. Therefore, it is important to have reliable methods to detect, monitor and visualise this metal in cells. Herein we report a new optical probe based on BODIPY, which shows a switch&#8208;on in its fluorescence intensity upon binding to copper(I), but not in the presence of high concentration of other physiologically relevant metal ions. More interestingly, binding to copper(I) leads to significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the new probe, which can be used to visualize copper(I) pools in lysosomes of live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Topochemical Ene&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed monomer having reactive groups, azide and alkene, adopts suitable crystal packing for a novel topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction (TEAC). Spontaneously, the monomer undergoes polymerization to yield triazoline&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion. The triazoline&#8208;linked polymer is transformed into a value&#8208;added aziridine&#8208;linked polymer by simple heating.







Abstract
Topochemical reactions, high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state reactions arising from the proximal alignment of reacting partners in the crystal lattice, do not require solvents, catalysts, and additives, are of high demand in the context of green processes and environmental safety. However, the bottleneck is the limited number of reactions that can be done in the crystal medium. We present the topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) reaction, wherein alkene and azide groups undergo lattice&#8208;controlled cycloaddition reaction giving triazoline in crystals. A designed monomer that arranges in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner in its crystals pre&#8208;organizing the reacting groups of adjacent molecules in proximity undergoes spontaneous cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, yielding the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. A unique advantage of this reaction is that the triazoline can be converted to aziridine by simple heating, which we exploited for the otherwise challenging post&#8208;synthetic backbone modification of the polymer. This reaction may revolutionize the field of polymer science.

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8211;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic capability of squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases to convert (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;substrates enantiospecifically to (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;configurated monocyclic terpenoids was put into action by a combination of enzyme evolution and substrate engineering for the synthesis of (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone with &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids, an SHC&#8208;wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC (AciSHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (E/Z)&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased to 79&#8201;%. Notably, analyzed AciSHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the (Z)&#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99&#8201;% ee), the (E)&#8208;isomer was converted to the (S,S)&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95&#8201;% ee). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9&#8201;% ee) could be obtained.

Muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene visualized a paramagnetic species produced by addition of muonium (Mu). DFT calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two isomers, and the metastable conformer including the almost planar fused tricyclic unit simulated the experimental hfcs. The metastable structure is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to light muon (&#956;+).







Abstract
In this communication, we report muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for understanding radical reactivity of 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene. Transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#956;SR) and muon avoided level&#8208;crossing resonance (&#956;LCR) measurements successfully visualized a paramagnetic species produced by regioselective addition of muonium (Mu) to the skeletal phosphorus atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two possible isomers. Whereas the most stable isomer including the envelope&#8208;type phosphorus heterocycle shows considerably different hyperfine coupling constants (hfcs) from those of the TF&#8208;&#956;SR and &#956;LCR, the metastable structure accompanying the almost planar tricyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton could simulate the experimentally determined hfcs. The metastable planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated paramagnetic tricyclic&#8208;fused skeleton is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to the light muon (&#956;+), one ninth of the proton mass.

         <title>Chemoselective and Highly Sensitive Quantification of Gut Microbiome and Human Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective probes based on stable isotope labeling allow for highly sensitive mass spectrometric quantification and detection of metabolites at attomole quantities in three human sample types.







Abstract
The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host's physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl&#8208;containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging. Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi&#8208;quantitative analysis at the femtomole level as well as qualitative analysis at attomole quantities that allows for detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics&#8208;driven biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our chemical biology tool will be of general use in metabolomics analysis to obtain a better understanding of microbial interactions with the human host and disease development.
