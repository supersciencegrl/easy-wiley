         <title>Framework&#8208;Hotspot Enhanced Trans Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Clinical Samples Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generate framework&#8208;hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities and investigate their impact on trans cleavage activity of Cas12a. Further, a modular platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction is developed, which enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples.







Abstract
The trans&#8208;cleavage property of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system makes it an excellent tool for disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, most methods based on CRISPR&#8208;Cas system still require pre&#8208;amplification of the target to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. Here we generate Framework&#8208;Hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities to investigate their effect on trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a. We find that the cleavage efficiency increases and the cleavage rate accelerates with increasing reporter density. We further construct a modular sensing platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction. Encouragingly, this modular platform enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples. The design provides a facile strategy for enhanced trans cleavage of Cas12a, which accelerates and broadens its applications in biosensing.

         <title>A Thiazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Lithium&#8208;Sulphur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline and porous materials, which offer a platform for integrating functional moieties in their backbone. Also, these materials can be post&#8208;synthetically modified for targeted applications. Herein, using molecular sulphur (S8), a post&#8208;synthetic topochemical conversion of an imine&#8208;linked COF into a thiazole&#8208;linked COF was performed for enhancing energy storage performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulphur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are a promising alternative power source, as they can provide a higher energy density than current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Porous materials are often used as cathode materials as they can act as a host for sulphur in such batteries. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have also been used, however they typically suffer from stability issues, resulting in limited and thus insufficient durability under practical conditions and applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based dimethoxybenzo&#8208;dithiophene functionalized COF (TTT&#8208;DMTD) incorporating high&#8208;density redox sites. The imine linkages were further post&#8208;synthetically transformed to yield a robust thiazole&#8208;linked COF (THZ&#8208;DMTD) by utilizing a sulphur&#8208;assisted chemical conversion method, while maintaining the crystallinity. As a synergistic effect of its high crystallinity, porosity and the presence of redox&#8208;active moieties, the thiazole&#8208;linked THZ&#8208;DMTD exhibited a high capacity and long&#8208;term stability (642&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;C; 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles) when applied as a cathode material in a Li&#8722;S battery.

         <title>Fucose Binding Motifs on Mucin Core Glycopeptides Impact Bacterial Lectin Recognition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable studies of fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins, a library of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides carrying Lewis&#8208; and H&#8208;antigen structures on mucin core glycans was prepared using a chemoenzymatic approach. This library was applied to evaluate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB and the Clostridium difficile toxin A binding preferences to explore the importance of the glycan core and peptide backbone presentation for lectin recognition.







Abstract
Mucin glycoproteins are essential components of the mucosal barrier, which protects the host from pathogens. Throughout evolution, bacteria have developed strategies to modulate and penetrate this barrier, and cause virulence by interacting with mucin O&#8208;glycans at the epithelial cell&#8208;surface. O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes on mucins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. Here, a chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy is described to prepare a library of fucosylated mucin core glycopeptides to enable studies of mucin&#8208;interacting and fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins. Glycan cores with biologically important Lewis and H&#8208;antigens were prepared decorating the peptide backbone at different sites and densities. The fucosylated mucin glycopeptides were applied in microarray binding studies to explore the importance of glycan core and peptide backbone presentation of these antigens in binding interactions with the P.&#8197;aeruginosa lectin LecB and the C.&#8197;difficile toxin&#8197;A.

         <title>Identifying the Role of Lewis&#8208;base Sites for the Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base site of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 is capable of capturing Li+ during the discharge process, which can optimize the adsorption strength of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2 intermediates, thereby leading to the solution&#8208;mediated growth of Li2O2 and ultimately improving the discharge capacity of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery. In addition, Lewis&#8208;base site can promote the activation of O2 and Li2O2 to reduce the overpotential of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery.







Abstract
Lewis&#8208;base sites have been widely applied to regulate the properties of Lewis&#8208;acid sites in electrocatalysts for achieving a drastic technological leap of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Whereas, the direct role and underlying mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base in the chemistry for LOBs are still rarely elucidated. Herein, we comprehensively shed light on the pivotal mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base sites in promoting the electrocatalytic reaction processes of LOBs by constructing the metal&#8211;organic framework containing Lewis&#8208;base sites (named as UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can act as electron donors that boost the activation of O2/Li2O2 during the discharged&#8208;charged process, resulting in the accelerated reaction kinetics of LOBs. More importantly, the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra and DFT calculations firstly demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can convert Li2O2 growth mechanism from surface&#8208;adsorption growth to solvation&#8208;mediated growth due to the capture of Li+ by Lewis&#8208;base sites upon discharged process, which weakens the adsorption energy of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2. As a proof of concept, LOB based on UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can achieve a high discharge specific capacity (12&#8201;661&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low discharged&#8208;charged overpotential (0.87&#8197;V) and long cycling life (169&#8197;cycles). This work reveals the direct role of Lewis&#8208;base sites, which can guide the design of electrocatalysts featuring Lewis&#8208;acid/base dual centers for LOBs.

This work reveals the direct role of Lewis-base sites, which can guide the design of electrocatalysts featuring Lewis-acid/base dual centers for LOBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Tuned TSCT&#8208;TADF in Donor&#8208;Acceptor MOF for Highly Adjustable Photonic Modules based on Heterostructures Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) were realized. Furthermore, heterostructures crystals featuring highly adjustable emissions in wide wavelength range was fabricated, illustrating its potential as photonic modules for photonic integrated circuit applications.







Abstract
Highly adjustable photonic modules were constructed based on the heterostructures crystals of a new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By introducing N&#8208;phenylcarbazole and derivatives as donor guests into the acceptor host NKU&#8208;111, highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer based TADF could be achieved through the engineering of heavy atom effect, which result in modulatable emission wavelength (540 to 600&#8197;nm) and enhanced quantum yield (up to 30.86&#8201;%). Furthermore, by rationally integrating the D&#8208;A MOFs with distinctive emissions, rod&#8208;like heterostructures crystals featuring excitation position dependent tip emissions in wide wavelength range (495 to 598&#8197;nm) could be fabricated, which could serve as highly potential photonic modules for photonic circuit applications.

         <title>Developing Insoluble Polyoxometalate Clusters to Bridge Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Water Oxidation Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cobalt(II)&#8208;containing polyoxometalate (POM) cluster&#8208;based solid catalysts were synthesized with different counter&#8208;cations and applied to photocatalytic water oxidation. Candidates in the series bridge homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts by offering activity comparable to the parent homogeneous catalyst and good recyclability.







Abstract
Cluster catalysts are attractive for their atomically precise structures, defined compositions, tunable coordination environments, uniform active sites, and their ability to transfer multiple electrons, but they suffer from poor stability and recyclability. Here, we report a general approach to the direct insolubilization of a water soluble polyoxometalate (POM) [{(B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PW9O34)Co3(OH)(H2O)2(O3PC(O)&#8208;(C3H6NH3)PO3)}2Co]14&#8722; (Co7) and formation of a series of POM&#8208;based solid catalysts with the counter&#8208;cations Ag+, Cs+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Y3+, and Ce3+. They exhibit improved catalytic activities for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation following the trend CsCo7&gt;SrCo7&gt;AgCo7&gt;CeIIICo7&gt;BaCo7&gt;YCo7&gt;PbCo7. While CsCo7 exhibits mainly homogeneous catalysis, the others are predominantly heterogeneous catalysts. An optimal oxygen yield of 41.3&#8201;% and a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 30.6&#8201;% for SrCo7 is obtained, which is comparable to that of the parent homogeneous POM. Band gap structures, UV/Vis spectra, and real&#8208;time laser flash photolysis experiments collectively suggest that easier electron transfer from the solid POM catalyst to the photosensitizer promotes photocatalytic water oxidation performance. These solid POM catalysts exhibit good stability, which is directly confirmed by a combination of Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, five cycles of tests, and poisoning experiments.

         <title>A Pro&#8208;Fluorescent Ubiquitin&#8208;Based Probe to Monitor Cysteine&#8208;Based E3 Ligase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an increased interest in E3 ligases as drug targets. Here we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye Rhodol triggering a strong fluorescence signal. Our platform allows detection of changes in E3 transthiolation activity in real time for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract ligases, as well as the discovery of new ligands for E3 ligases.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modification with ubiquitin (Ub) is a versatile signal regulating almost all aspects of cell biology, and an increasing range of diseases is associated with impaired Ub modification. In this light, the Ub system offers an attractive, yet underexplored route to the development of novel targeted treatments. A promising strategy for small molecule intervention is posed by the final components of the enzymatic ubiquitination cascade, E3 ligases, as they determine the specificity of the protein ubiquitination pathway. Here, we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe, which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye, amenable to profile the E3 transthiolation activity for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract E3 ligases. UbSRhodol enabled detection of changes in transthiolation efficacy evoked by enzyme key point mutations or conformational changes, and offers an excellent assay reagent amenable to a high&#8208;throughput screening setup allowing the identification of small molecules modulating E3 activity.

         <title>Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different reaction types (homolytic, heterolytic, and electrocyclic cleavage) can be selectively activated in the gas phase through a modulation of noncovalent interactions for a multifunctional amino&#8208;azoalkane, as shown by mass spectrometry, transition&#8208;state modeling, and DFT calculations. Three different &#963; bonds are being broken, demonstrating a supramolecular control of chemoselectivity that is reminiscent of mode&#8208;selective chemistry.







Abstract
In the gas phase, thermal activation of supramolecular assemblies such as host&#8211;guest complexes leads commonly to noncovalent dissociation into the individual components. Chemical reactions, for example of encapsulated guest molecules, are only found in exceptional cases. As observed by mass spectrometry, when 1&#8208;amino&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;2&#8208;ene (DBOA) is complexed by the macrocycle &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, its protonated complex undergoes collision&#8208;induced dissociation into its components, the conventional reaction pathway. Inside the macrocyclic cavity of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), a competitive chemical reaction of monoprotonated DBOA takes place upon thermal activation, namely a stepwise homolytic covalent bond cleavage with the elimination of N2, while the doubly protonated CB7&#8901;DBOA complex undergoes an inner&#8208;phase elimination of ethylene, a concerted, electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction. These chemical reaction pathways stand in contrast to the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of uncomplexed monoprotonated DBOA, for which an elimination of NH3 predominates upon collision&#8208;induced activation, as a heterolytic bond cleavage reaction. The combined results, which can be rationalized in terms of organic&#8208;chemical reaction mechanisms and density&#8208;function theoretical calculations, demonstrate that chemical reactions in the gas phase can be steered chemoselectively through noncovalent interactions.

These chemical reaction pathways stand in contrast to the gas-phase chemistry of uncomplexed monoprotonated DBOA, for which an elimination of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; predominates upon collision-induced activation, as a heterolytic bond cleavage reaction. The combined results, which can be rationalized in terms of organic-chemical reaction mechanisms and density-function theoretical calculations, demonstrate that chemical reactions in the gas phase can be steered chemoselectively through noncovalent interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized chiral cis&#8208;decalins was realized by merging Birch reduction and a tandem olefin migration/asymmetric IEDDA reaction. Up to six contiguous and two quaternary stereocenters could be formed in one step by efficient kinetic resolution. The synthetic value of the approach is illustrated by the concise total synthesis of (+)&#8208;occidentalol and the synthesis of a key intermediate for seven triterpenes.







Abstract
Herein, we show that the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well&#8208;modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/CuII complex, a wide range of polysubstituted cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds with up to six contiguous stereocenters were generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of the sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes formed in situ are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2&#8208; and/or C3&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates. DFT calculations elucidated that the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion and revealed the origins of the stereoselectivities.

         <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Pathologically Activated Assay for Efficient Bioorthogonal Catalytic Selective Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative acid/H2S&#8208;responsive molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) has been constructed for selective antibiofilm therapy. The Cu&#8208;POM NCs not only self&#8208;assemble into larger aggregates for biofilm&#8208;responsive and efficient alkyne&#8208;azide click (CuAAC) reactions to generate antibacterial molecules, but also produce a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect, switchable by H2S in pathogens for selective therapy.







Abstract
Since polyoxometalates (POMs) can undergo reversible multi&#8208;electron redox transformations, they have been used to modulate the electronic environment of metal nanoparticles for catalysis. Besides, POMs possess unique electronic structures and acid&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly ability. These properties inspired us to tackle the drawbacks of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction in biomedical applications, such as low catalytic efficiency and unsatisfactory disease selectivity. Herein, we construct molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM nanoclusters doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) as a highly efficient bioorthogonal catalyst, which is responsive to pathologicallyacid and H2S for selective antibiofilm therapy. Leveraging the merits of POMs, the Cu&#8208;POM NCs exhibit biofilm&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior, efficient CuAAC&#8208;mediated in situ synthesis of antibacterial molecules, and a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect selectively triggered by H2S in pathogens. The consumption of bacterial H2S at the pathological site by Cu&#8208;POM NCs extremely decreases the number of persisterbacteria, which is conducive to the inhibition of bacterial tolerance and elimination of biofilms. Unlocked at pathological sites and endowed with NIR&#8208;II photothermal property, the constructed POM&#8208;based bioorthogonal catalytic platform provides new insights into the design of efficient and selective bioorthogonal catalysts for disease therapy.

         <title>Direct Comparison of Lysine versus Site&#8208;Specific Protein Surface Immobilization in Single&#8208;Molecule Mechanical Assays
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface immobilization technique for atomic force microscopy/single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy is crucial for experimental yield, accuracy and resolution. Reported herein is that a commonly used lysine&#8208;based immobilization can result in significant signal deterioration, including lowering of rupture forces, effective shortening of linkers, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway polyprotein system.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force&#8208;transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site&#8208;specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site&#8208;specific vs. lysine&#8208;based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine&#8208; vs. ybbR&#8208;based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine&#8208;based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin&#8208;biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin&#8208;Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site&#8208;specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface&#8208;bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo&#8208;derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.

         <title>Programmed Pore&#8208;Shape Fixing in a Soft Porous Molecular Crystal&#8212;Navigating the Phase Interconversion Landscape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;known organic soft porous crystal is shown to undergo pore&#8208;shape fixing in response to high&#8208;pressure uptake of CO2 gas. Despite two decades of studies of this material, this work formulates, for the first time, an unambiguous phase interconversion Scheme to facilitate navigation of the metastable phase landscape, which now includes a 4th guest&#8208;free polymorph with enhanced porosity.







Abstract
Pore&#8208;shape fixing effects (PSFEs) in soft porous crystals are a relatively unexplored area of materials chemistry. We report the PSFE in the prototypical dynamic van der Waals solid p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (TBC4). Starting with the high&#8208;density guest&#8208;free phase, two porous shape&#8208;fixed phases were programmed using the stimuli of CO2 pressure and temperature. A suite of complementary in situ techniques, including variable&#8208;pressure (VP) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP differential scanning calorimetry, volumetric sorption analysis, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy was used to track dynamic guest&#8208;induced transformations, providing molecular&#8208;level insight into the PSFE. The interconversion between the two metastable phases is particle size dependent, making this the second example of the PSFE by crystal downsizing, and the first example involving a porous molecular crystal: larger particles undergo reversible transitions while smaller particles remain fixed in the metastable phase. A complete phase interconversion scheme was constructed for the material, thus allowing navigation of the phase interconversion landscape of TBC4 using the easily applied stimuli of CO2 pressure and thermal treatment.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;scan ultraselective heteronuclear polarization transfer (UHPT) NMR method is presented. When applied to chromopeptide pharmaceuticals and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide with highly complex NMR signals in both the 1H and 13C dimension, this method provided accurate 1H&#8208;13C correlation and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra of individual subunits, which enabled unambiguous structure assignment.







Abstract
Complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of organic compounds containing multiple analogous substructures or mixtures pose a significant challenge to structural identification, thus resulting in frequent misassignment of structures. The GEMSTONE method, a single&#8208;scan technique that selectively excites a specific proton signal among the crowded NMR signals, was recently proposed as a solution. However, its extension to the polarization transfer method for heteronuclear spin systems was unsuccessful. Herein, we present an extension method that addresses the altered heteronuclear polarization transfer efficiency and enables the acquisition of ultraselective 13C and 1H&#8208;13C correlation NMR subspectra with hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the structural analysis of a chromopeptide pharmaceutical and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide.

         <title>Unraveling the Oxidation Behaviors of MXenes in Aqueous Systems by Active&#8208;Learning&#8208;Potential Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation kinetics of MXenes were studied using active&#8208;learning&#8208;potential molecular dynamics. MXenes spontaneously oxidize to transition&#8208;metal oxides in water, which form oxide protection layers on the surface to further inhibit the oxidation process. The free protons in water also impair the water's motility, inhibiting its attack on the MXene surface.







Abstract
MXenes are 2D materials with great potential in various applications. However, the degradation of MXenes in humid environments has become a main obstacle in their practical use. Here we combine deep neural networks and an active learning scheme to develop a neural network potential (NNP) for aqueous MXene systems with ab initio precision but low cost. The oxidation behaviors of super large aqueous MXene systems are investigated systematically at nanosecond timescales for the first time. The oxidation process of MXenes is clearly displayed at the atomic level. Free protons and oxides greatly inhibit subsequent oxidation reactions, leading to the degree of oxidation of MXenes to exponentially decay with time, which is consistent with the oxidation rate of MXenes measured experimentally. Importantly, this computational study represents the first exploration of the kinetic process of oxidation of super&#8208;sized aqueous MXene systems. It opens a promising avenue for the future development of effective protection strategies aimed at controlling the stability of MXenes.

         <title>Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 27 oligosaccharides as heparan sulfate mimetics were efficiently synthesized from the natural aminoglycoside tobramycin in 7&#8211;12 steps. Rapid generation of these sulfated aminoglycans will provide a tool to decipher HS&#8208;protein interactions and develop HS therapeutic potential.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high&#8208; and low&#8208;sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure&#8208;function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well&#8208;defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7&#8211;12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps as compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insight, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from the aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off&#8208;target platelet factor&#8208;4 protein.

         <title>Illustrating the Fate of Methyl Radical in Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fleeting intermediates such as methyl radical (&#8901;CH3), methoxy radical and formaldehyde, were captured during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry, which sheds light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8901;CH3.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has emerged as an ideal method for the direct activation and conversion of methane under mild conditions. In this reaction, methyl radical (&#8901;CH3) was deemed a key intermediate that affected the yields and selectivity of the products. However, direct observation of &#8901;CH3 and other intermediates is still challenging. Here, a rectangular photocatalytic reactor coupled with in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS) was developed to detect reactive intermediates within several hundred microseconds during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO. Gas phase &#8901;CH3 generated by photogenerated holes (O&#8722;) was directly observed, and its formation was demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by coadsorbed oxygen molecules. Methoxy radical (CH3O&#8901;) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were confirmed to be key C1 intermediates in photocatalytic methane overoxidation to CO2. The gas&#8208;phase self&#8208;coupling reaction of &#8901;CH3 contributes to the formation of ethane, which indicates the key role of &#8901;CH3 desorption in the highly selective synthesis of ethane. Based on the observed intermediates, the reaction network initiated from &#8901;CH3 of photocatalytic methane oxidation could be clearly illustrated, which is helpful for studying the photocatalytic methane conversion processes.

         <title>New Anderson&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrodes for Energy Storage Boosted Through Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineering of novel nanostructured electrode materials represents a viable strategy to obtain devices with high energy and power density. We present the synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) with superior electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (125&#8197;F/g), energy and power density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg and 3.7&#8197;kW/kg, respectively) and high cyclability (5000 cycles).







Abstract
The unique electrochemical properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) render them ideal components for the fabrication of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems. However, their practical applications have been hindered by their high solubility in common electrolytes. This problem can be overcome by the effective hybridization of POMs with other materials. Here we present the design and synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) via one&#8208;pot solvothermal strategy between an amino&#8208;functionalized Anderson&#8208;type POM and a trialdehyde&#8208;based building unit. We show that structural and functional complexity can be enriched by adding hydroxyl groups in the 2,4,6 position to the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde allowing to exploit for the first time in POCOFs the keto&#8208;enol tautomerization as additional feature to impart greater chemical stability to the COFs and enhanced properties leading to large specific surface area (347&#8197;m2/g) and superior electrochemical performance of the POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes, when compared with POCOF&#8208;2 electrodes that possess only imine&#8208;type linkage and with pristine POM electrodes. Specifically, POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes display remarkable specific, areal, and volumetric capacitance (125&#8197;F/g, 248&#8197;mF/cm2 and 41.9&#8197;mF/cm3, respectively) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A/g, a maximum energy density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg), a maximum power density (3.7&#8197;kW/kg) and an outstanding cyclability (90&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).

However, their practical applications have been hindered by their high solubility in common electrolytes. This problem can be overcome by the effective hybridization of POMs with other materials. Here we present the design and synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate-covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) via one-pot solvothermal strategy between an amino-functionalized Anderson-type POM and a trialdehyde-based building unit. We show that structural and functional complexity can be enriched by adding hydroxyl groups in the 2,4,6 position to the benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde allowing to exploit for the first time in POCOFs the keto-enol tautomerization as additional feature to impart greater chemical stability to the COFs and enhanced properties leading to large specific surface area (347&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g) and superior electrochemical performance of the POCOF-1 electrodes, when compared with POCOF-2 electrodes that possess only imine-type linkage and with pristine POM electrodes. Specifically, POCOF-1 electrodes display remarkable specific, areal, and volumetric capacitance (125&#8197;F/g, 248&#8197;mF/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 41.9&#8197;mF/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A/g, a maximum energy density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg), a maximum power density (3.7&#8197;kW/kg) and an outstanding cyclability (90&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Degradation Parameters of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

In this work, we demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The cycling stability shows an inverse relationship with the thickness of the NiO surface layer. Simulation analysis further indicates that the slower Li+ diffusivity of NiO mainly accounts for the performance decay of the cathode.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal LiNixCoyMnzO2 (SC&#8208;NCM, x+y+z=1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long&#8208;term cycling. While advances have been made using SC&#8208;NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC&#8208;NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC&#8208;NCM65 cells showed &gt;77&#8201;% capacity retention below 4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56&#8201;% for 4.7&#8197;V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO&#8208;type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition&#8208;metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock&#8208;salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modeling analysis further indicate that the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.

         <title>Stepwise O2&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Disassembly of the [NiFe4(OH)(&#956;3&#8208;S)4] Active Site Cluster of CO Dehydrogenase</title>

Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) are inactivated by dioxygen. High&#8208;resolution crystallography was used to show how O2 induces a stepwise rearrangement of the Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster in the active site, with evidence for a reversible and an irreversible phase of cluster destruction. The open coordination site on Ni renders the cluster vulnerable, and its protection offers strategies to prevent inactivation.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. CODHs are found in anaerobic microorganisms and can rapidly lose their activity when exposed to air. What causes the loss of activity is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the time&#8208;dependent structural changes induced by the presence of air on the metal centers of CODH&#8208;II. We show that inactivation is a multistep process. In a reversible step, the open coordination site on the Ni ion is blocked by a Ni,Fe&#8208;bridging &#956;&#8208;sulfido or chlorido ligand. Blocking this open coordination site with a cyanide ligand stabilizes the cluster against O2&#8208;induced decomposition, indicating that O2 attacks at the Ni ion. In the subsequent irreversible phase, nickel is lost, the Fe ions rearrange and the sulfido ligands disappear. Our data are consistent with a reversible reductive reactivation mechanism to protect CODHs from transient over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of a Giant [Mn86] Nanocage&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Specific CO2 Binding Pockets for Highly Selective CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bioinspired design strategy, a CO2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a, is fabricated, which possesses unprecedented [Mn86] nanocage&#8208;based structure and high structure robustness. Attributed to the unique enzyme&#8208;like CO2&#8208;binding pockets, NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a can selectively remove CO2 from CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures with high selectivities.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures has demonstrated great potential for solving energy security and environmental sustainability challenges. However, due to similar physicochemical properties between CO2 and other gases as well as the co&#8208;adsorption behavior, the selectivity of CO2 is severely limited in currently reported CO2&#8208;selective sorbents. To address the challenge, we create a bioinspired design strategy and report a robust, microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with unprecedented [Mn86] nanocages. Attributed to the existence of unique enzyme&#8208;like confined pockets, strong coordination interactions and dipole&#8208;dipole interactions are generated for CO2 molecules, resulting in only CO2 molecules fitting in the pocket while other gas molecules are prohibited. Thus, this MOF can selectively remove CO2 from various gas mixtures and show record&#8208;high selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures. Highly efficient CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 separations are achieved, as verified by experimental breakthrough tests. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of adsorbents with high CO2 selectivity and provides important guidance for designing highly effective adsorbents for gas separation.

A one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation process applied to 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones under borane catalysis with PhSiH3 for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines is presented. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism. The diastereoselectivity was found to originate from a C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines.

Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene with HB(C6F5)2 allows for the one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones with commercially available PhSiH3 to exclusively afford trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr).

     alt="Borane-Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Hydrosilylation Towards Enantio- and Diastereoselective Construction of trans-2,3-Disubstituted-1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoxalines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation process applied to 1,2-diaminobenzenes and 1,2-diketones under borane catalysis with PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines is presented. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism. The diastereoselectivity was found to originate from a C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines. However, enantio- and diastereoselective access to &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines remains much less explored. Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair-based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2-vinylnaphthalene with HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows for the one-pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2-diaminobenzenes and 1,2-diketones with commercially available PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively afford &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr).

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanodots Can Act as Molecular Catalysts in Chemical and Photochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral carbon nanodots (CNDs) is synthesized through a hydrothermal treatment of molecular precursors. The surface amino functionalities along with the photophysical and redox properties of the material allowed its exploitation as a multifunctional catalytic platform. The CNDs promote enantioselective organocatalytic reactions, photochemical processes and organophotoredox transformations.







Abstract
In this work, a microwave synthesis followed by a simple purification process produces a new type of chiral Carbon Nanodots (CNDs). These CNDs are soluble in organic solvents, exhibit amino groups on their surface and display interesting absorption and emission properties along with mirror image profiles in the electronic circular dichroism spectrum. All these features set the stage for CNDs to act as multifunctional catalytic platforms, able to promote diverse chemical transformations. In particular, the outer shell composition of CNDs was instrumental to carry out organocatalytic reactions in an enantioselective fashion. In addition, the redox and light&#8208;absorbing properties of the material are suitable to drive photochemical processes. Finally, the photoredox and organocatalytic activations of CNDs were exploited at the same time to promote a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. This work demonstrates that CNDs can be used as catalysts to promote multiple reactivities, previously considered exclusive domain of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for Improving Mechanical Stability of Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging electrolyte design, which can construct high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes, is proposed for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. High&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI effectively restricts its fracture and ongoing reactions of electrolytes on lithium metal anodes, which notably improves the stability of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur coin and pouch cells.







Abstract
Practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are severely plagued by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in routine ether electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte with 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (TO) and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) as co&#8208;solvents is proposed to construct a high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI by enriching organic components in Li&#8722;S batteries. The high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI works compatibly in Li&#8722;S batteries. TO with high polymerization capability can preferentially decompose and form organic&#8208;rich SEI, strengthening mechanical stability of SEI, which mitigates crack and regeneration of SEI and reduces the consumption rate of active Li, Li polysulfides, and electrolytes. Meanwhile, DME ensures high specific capacity of S cathodes. Accordingly, the lifespan of Li&#8722;S batteries increases from 75&#8197;cycles in routine ether electrolyte to 216&#8197;cycles in TO&#8208;based electrolyte. Furthermore, a 417&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Li&#8722;S pouch cell undergoes 20&#8197;cycles. This work provides an emerging electrolyte design for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Synthesis and Optoelectronic Applications of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; Conjugated Polymers with a Di&#8208;metallaaromatic Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a di&#8208;metallaaromatic acceptor with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and introduced it to a series of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated metallopolymers using a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology. These metallopolymers can be applied as electron transport layer materials of an organic solar cell, improving the power conversion efficiency considerably.







Abstract
The development of conjugated polymers especially n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. Herein, a strong acceptor building block with di&#8208;metallaaromatic structure was designed and synthesized by connecting two electron&#8208;deficient metallaaromatic units through a &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. Then, a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers. The isolated well&#8208;defined model oligomers indicated polymer structures. Kinetic studies based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopies shed light on the polymerization process. Interestingly, the resulted metallopolymers with d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugations are very promising electron transport layer materials which can boost photovoltaic performance of an organic solar cell, with power conversion efficiency up to 18.28&#8201;% based on the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;EH&#8208;HD&#8208;4F non&#8208;fullerene system. This work not only provides a facile route to construct metallaaromatic conjugated polymers with various functional groups, but also discovers their potential applications for the first time.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents is reported wherein two alkyl&#8208;alkyl bonds are generated in one step.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents. The reaction produces &#947;&#8208;arylated alkanecarbonyl compounds with the generation of two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at the vicinal carbons of alkenes. This reaction is effective for the use of primary, secondary and tertiary &#945;&#8208;halocarboxylic esters, amides and ketones in conjunction with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents as the sources of two C(sp3) carbons for the dialkylation of terminal and cyclic internal alkenes.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;-bromocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents is reported wherein two alkyl-alkyl bonds are generated in one step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disclose a Ni-catalyzed regioselective dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;-halocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents. The reaction produces &#947;-arylated alkanecarbonyl compounds with the generation of two new C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds at the vicinal carbons of alkenes. This reaction is effective for the use of primary, secondary and tertiary &#945;-halocarboxylic esters, amides and ketones in conjunction with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents as the sources of two C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) carbons for the dialkylation of terminal and cyclic internal alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimerization of a Reactive Azaacene Diradical: Synthesis of a Covalent Azaacene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of two reactive dicyanomethyl diradicals forms a covalent azaacene cage. In this cascade, four new, elongated &#963;&#8208;CC&#8208;bonds (marked in red) are formed and the internal alkynes transformed into cumulenes. The cage was investigated via several spectroscopy methods at different temperatures, suggesting the reformation of its constituting diradical.







Abstract
Two series of regioisomeric dicyanomethylene substituted dithienodiazatetracenes with formal para&#8208; or ortho&#8208;quinodimethane subunits were synthesized and characterized. Whereas the para&#8208;isomers (p&#8208;n, diradical index y0=0.01) are stable and isolable, the ortho&#8208;isomer (y0=0.98) dimerizes into a covalent azaacene cage. Four elongated &#963;&#8208;CC bonds are formed and the former triisopropylsilyl(TIPS) &#8208;ethynylene groups transformed into cumulene units. The azaacene cage dimer (o&#8208;1)2 was characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis and temperature&#8208;dependent infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, solid&#8208;state), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopies (solution) indicating reformation of o&#8208;1.

         <title>Directly Imaging and Regulating the Nanoscale Inhomogeneity of S&#8208;Vacancies in Molybdenum Disulfide Monolayer during Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of activity of molybdenum disulfide monolayer with potential during hydrogen evolution is observed by opto&#8208;electrochemical imaging. The inhomogeneous spatial distribution of local active sites and uncharged impurities is identified with high sensitivity. The WE, RE and CE represent the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.







Abstract
The study of electron transfer event on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides has attracted tremendous attentions attributing to their promising applications in electrochemical devices. Herein, we demonstrate an opto&#8208;electrochemical strategy to directly map and regulate electron transfer event on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer by combining bright field (BF) imaging technique with electrochemical modulation. The heterogeneity of electrochemical activity on MoS2 monolayer down to nanoscale is resolved spatiotemporally. The thermodynamics of MoS2 monolayer is measured during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the Arrhenius correlations are obtained. We validate that the defect generation engineered by oxygen plasma bombardment dramatically enhances the local electrochemical activity of MoS2 monolayer, which can be attributed to point defects of S&#8208;vacancies as evidenced. Furthermore, by comparing the difference of electron transfer event on MoS2 with various layers, the interlayer coupling effect is uncovered. This study represents a facile method to image the heterogeneity of electrochemical properties for nanomaterials with atomic thickness and regulate the local activity within the plane by extrinsic factors. It also has potential applications in the design and evaluation of high&#8208;performance layered electrochemical systems down to nanoscale.

         <title>Bright Free&#8208;Radical Emission in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole ionic liquids have been used to protect photoinduced radical emissions from carbonyl through electrostatic interactions and spin delocalization effects, with a highest emission efficiency of 53.3&#8201;% achieved. The radical system could be used to build multi&#8208;color and heat&#8208;responsive luminescence materials. They could also be used to detect different amine compounds based on the change in the emission and photoactivation times.







Abstract
It is challenging to achieve stable and efficient radical emissions under ambient conditions. Herein, we present a rational design strategy to protect photoinduced carbonyl free radical emission through electrostatic interaction and spin delocalization effects. The host&#8208;guest system is constructed from tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules and a series of imidazolium ionic liquids as the guest and host, respectively, whereby the carbonyl anion radical emission can be in situ generated under the light irradiation and further stabilized by electrostatic interaction. More importantly, the anion species and the alkyl chain length of imidazolium ionic liquids show a noticeable effect on luminescence efficiency, with the highest radical emission efficiency is as high as 53.3&#8201;% after optimizing the imidazole ionic liquid's structure, which is about four times higher than the polymer&#8208;protected radical system. Theoretical calculations confirm the synergistic effect of strong electrostatic interactions and that the spin delocalization effect significantly stabilizes the radical emission. Moreover, such a radical emission system also could be integrated with a fluorescent dye to induce multi&#8208;color or even white light emission with reversible temperature&#8208;responsive characteristics. The radical emission system can also be used to detect different amine compounds on the basis of the emission changes and photoactivation time.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped Ni0 Systems Featuring Cationic Tetrylenes: Direct Observation of L/Z&#8208;type Ligand Duality, and Alkene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic low&#8208;coordinate tetrylenes are shown to behave as Z&#8208;type ligands towards Ni0, forming rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 complexes. These selectively bind classical N&#8208;bases at EII (E=Ge, Sn), which switches the nature of this ligand centre from Z&#8208; to L&#8208;type, concomitant with a geometry switch at Ni to trigonal planar. T&#8208;shaped systems are active catalysts for alkene hydrogenation, establishing a new class of catalyst for this challenging transformation.







Abstract
We report a facile synthetic method for accessing rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 species, stabilised by low&#8208;coordinate cationic germylene and stannylene ligands which behave as Z&#8208;type ligands toward Ni0. An in&#8208;depth computational analysis indicates significant Nid&#8594;Ep donation (E=Ge, Sn), with essentially no E&#8594;Ni donation. The tetrylene ligand's Lewis acidity can be modulated in situ through the addition of a donor ligand, which selectively binds at the Lewis acidic tetrylene site. This switches this binding centre from a Z&#8208;type to a classical L&#8208;type ligand, with a concomitant geometry switch at Ni0 from T&#8208;shaped to trigonal planar. Exploring the effects of this geometry switch in catalysis, isolated T&#8208;shaped complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c and 4&#8201;a&#8211;c are capable of the hydrogenation of alkenes under mild conditions, whilst the closely related trigonal planar and tetrahedral Ni0 complexes 5, D, and E, which feature L&#8208;type chloro&#8208; or cationic&#8208;tetrylene ligands, are inactive under these conditions. Further, addition of small amounts of N&#8208;bases to the catalytic systems involving T&#8208;shaped complexes significantly reduces turnover rates, giving evidence for the in situ modulation of ligand electronics for catalytic switching.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones via Tandem Allylboration/Lactonization: a Kinetic Resolution Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via a tandem allylboration/lactonization approach was achieved using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex. The kinetic resolution of the allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization was found to be a key aspect responsible for the success of this transformation. Stereodivergent syntheses and total syntheses of eupomatilones 2, 5 and 6 proved its synthetic utility.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motif is a widely encountered unit in many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, a practical and efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones from readily available allylic boronates and benzaldehyde derivatives was developed with chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex as the catalyst. The key success of this transformation was the kinetic resolution of allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization. This protocol enabled to assemble all of four stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials upon variable lactonization. Taking advantage of the current method as the key step, catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of eupomatilones 2, 5, and 6 was accomplished. Control experiments were carried out to probe into the tandem reaction as well as the origin of stereoselectivities.

         <title>Low&#8208;silica Cu&#8208;CHA Zeolite Enriched with Al Pairs Transcribed from Silicoaluminophosphate Seed: Synthesis and Ammonia Selective Catalytic Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>

The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promoted the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process and thus results in a low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite with enriched Al pairs.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;exchanged low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites (Si/Al&#8804;4) synthesized without organic templates are promising candidate catalysts for ammonia selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NH3&#8208;SCR), but their practical application is restricted due to the low hydrothermal stability. Here, inspired by the transcription from duplex DNA to RNA, we synthesized Al pairs enriched low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite (CHA&#8208;SPAEI, Si/Al=3.7) by using silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) featured by strict alternation of &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; tetrahedra as seed. The proportion of Al pairs in CHA&#8722;SPAEI is 78&#8201;%, which is much higher than that in the conventional low&#8208;silica CHA (CHA&#8208;LS, 52&#8201;%). After hydrothermal ageing at 800&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h, Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;SPAEI shows NO conversion above 90&#8201;% within 225&#8211;500&#8201;&#176;C under a gas hourly space velocity of 200,000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much better than that of Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;LS. The spatial close proximity of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is confirmed by the 27Al double&#8208;quantum single&#8208;quantum two&#8208;dimensional NMR analyses. The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8208; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate&#8208;based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.

         <title>Expedient Access to Enantioenriched 1&#8208;Azaspiro Cyclobutanones Enabled by Modified Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a unified strategy for the asymmetric construction of [3,4]&#8208;azaspirocycles by employing the Heyns reactivity upon its electrophilic modification. The chiral phosphoric acid is an efficient catalyst for this transformation and allows to access a wide range of cyclobutanone containing 1&#8208;azaspirocycles with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Leveraging the unexplored regions of chemical space, the integration of spirocyclic cyclobutane in a molecular scaffold opens up a new vista in modern drug discovery. Despite recent advancements in achieving the synthesis of such motifs, strategies for their asymmetric construction have not been well&#8208;recognized and remain a formidable challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have demonstrated a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;azaspiro cyclobutanone enabled by an unusual reactivity of enamine that explore the potentiality of Heyns rearrangement upon electrophilic modification. This design strategy offers viable access to a wide range of cyclobutanone containing spiroindoline and spiropyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, the practicality of this methodology has been shown by a scale&#8208;up synthesis of spirocyclic products and their facile post&#8208;synthetic modifications.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer from Xanthates to Acyl Azoliums: Divergent Ketone Synthesis via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile NHC&#8208;catalyzed method has been developed for synthesizing ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives through SET (single electron transfer) between photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums. This approach further facilitates the generation of structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones by incorporating alkenes and enynes.







Abstract
Considering the prevalence of alcohols and carboxylic acids, their fragment cross&#8208;coupling reactions could hold significant implications in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a versatile method for synthesizing a diverse range of ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums undergo single electron transfer (SET) under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, generating NHC&#8208;derived ketyl radicals and alkyl radicals. These open&#8208;shell intermediates subsequently undergo the radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction, yielding valuable ketones. Furthermore, this approach can be employed in three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and enynes, resulting in structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones. The unified strategy offers a unique opportunity for the fragment coupling of a diverse range of alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives, accommodating diverse functional groups even in complex settings.

         <title>Revealing Active Sites and Reaction Pathways in Methane Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling over Iron&#8208;Containing Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siliceous iron&#8208;containing zeolites were synthesized for methane non&#8208;oxidative coupling. Advanced spectroscopic investigations elucidated the active sites including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores, and revealed the gas&#8208;phase reaction pathways starting from methyl radicals towards (poly)aromatic species.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane is a promising route to obtain ethylene directly from natural gas. We synthesized siliceous [Fe]zeolites with MFI and CHA topologies and found that they display high selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% for MFI and &gt;99&#8201;% for CHA) to ethylene and ethane among gas&#8208;phase products. Deactivated [Fe]zeolites can be regenerated by burning coke in air. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Fe3+ centers in zeolite framework of fresh catalysts are reduced during the reaction to the active sites, including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores. Photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy results show that methyl radicals are the reaction intermediates formed upon methane activation. Ethane is formed by methyl radical coupling, followed by its dehydrogenation to ethylene. Based on the observation of intermediates including allene, vinylacetylene, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, 2&#8208;butyne, and cyclopentadiene over [Fe]MFI, a reaction network is proposed leading to polyaromatic species. Such reaction intermediates are not observed over the small&#8208;pore [Fe]CHA, where ethylene and ethane are the only gas&#8208;phase products.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Gated and Self&#8208;Protected Bioorthogonal Catalyst for Nanozyme&#8208;Assisted Safe Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a self&#8208;protected and responsive bioorthogonal catalyst to achieve efficient and precise intracellular drug synthesis for safe cancer combination therapy. This appealing strategy will promote the development of bioorthogonal catalyst&#8208;mediated novel antineoplastic platforms.







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal uncaging catalysis has sparked increasing interest in prodrug activation. However, due to their &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA&#8208;gated and self&#8208;protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme&#8208;Pd0 with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy. Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities could improve the catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will promote the development of secure and efficient bioorthogonal catalytic systems and provide new insights into novel antineoplastic platforms.

         <title>Combining Carbazole Building Blocks and &#957;&#8208;DABNA Heteroatom Alignment for a Double Boron&#8208;Embedded MR&#8208;TADF Emitter with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collocating carbazole building blocks with &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment, a novel double boron&#8208;embedded multiple resonance emitter &#928;&#8208;CzBN is obtained and exhibits superior photophysical properties. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on &#928;&#8208;CzBN achieve an exceptional efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a mild roll&#8208;off and a narrow full width at half maximum of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV in the bluish&#8208;green region.







Abstract
Building blocks and heteroatom alignments are two determining factors in designing multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. Carbazole&#8208;fused MR emitters, represented by CzBN derivatives, and the heteroatom alignments of &#957;&#8208;DABNA are two star series of MR&#8208;TADF emitters that show impressive performances from the aspects of building blocks and heteroatom alignments, respectively. Herein, a novel CzBN analog, &#928;&#8208;CzBN, featuring &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment is developed via facile one&#8208;shot lithium&#8208;free borylation. &#928;&#8208;CzBN exhibits superior photophysical properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% and narrowband sky blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm/85&#8197;meV. It also gives efficient TADF properties with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy offset of 40&#8197;meV and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 2.9&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. The optimized OLED using &#928;&#8208;CzBN as the emitter achieves an exceptional external quantum efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 20&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a narrowband emission at 495&#8197;nm with FWHM of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV, making it one of the best reported devices based on MR emitters with comprehensive performance.

         <dc:description>
The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. A MOF glass catalyst was synthesized via a melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62). Introducing the MOF glass catalyst on various metal oxide semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer constructs the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, and thus improve PEC performance.







Abstract
Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics and serious charge recombination restrict the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving PEC water splitting performance. Herein, a MOF glass catalyst through melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62) was introduced on various metal oxide (MO: Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4) semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer, constructing the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. Owing to the excellent conductivity, stability and open active sites of MOF glass, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes exhibit a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity and stability in comparison to pristine MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and thus improve PEC performance. This MOF glass not only serves as an excellent OER cocatalyst on tunable photoelectrodes, but also enables promising opportunities for PEC devices for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Tandem Guest&#8208;Host&#8208;Receptor Recognitions Precisely Guide Ciprofloxacin to Eliminate Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>

A strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions was proposed to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to effectively eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M was obtained through guest&#8208;host recognition. After targeting S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected macrophages via ligand&#8208;receptor recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M underwent intracellular caspase&#8208;1&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form ciprofloxacin nanoparticle, leading to enhanced antibacterial efficiency.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) is able to hide within host cells to escape immune clearance and antibiotic action, causing life&#8208;threatening infections. To boost the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics, new intracellular delivery approaches are urgently needed. Herein, by rational design of an adamantane (Ada)&#8208;containing antibiotic&#8208;peptide precursor Ada&#8208;Gly&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Asp&#8208;Cys(StBu)&#8208;Lys(Ciprofloxacin)&#8208;CBT (Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada), we propose a strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Via guest&#8208;host recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada is decorated with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;heptamannoside (CD&#8208;M) derivative to yield Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M, which is able to target mannose receptor&#8208;overexpressing macrophages via multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor recognition. After uptake, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M undergoes caspase&#8208;1 (an overexpressed enzyme during S.&#8197;aureus infection)&#8208;initiated CBT&#8208;Cys click reaction to self&#8208;assemble into ciprofloxacin nanoparticle Nano&#8208;Cip. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that, compared with ciprofloxacin or Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M shows superior intracellular bacteria elimination and inflammation alleviation efficiency in S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected RAW264.7 cells and mouse infection models, respectively. This work provides a supramolecular platform of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide antibiotics to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus infection efficiently.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into the Interlayer Characteristics and Oxygen Reactivity of Bilayer Borophene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was used to study the local chemical properties of bilayer synthetic two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) with atomic&#8208;scale spatial resolution. TERS established the chemical fingerprint of bilayer borophene that is correlated with the vibration of interlayer B&#8722;B bonds and revealed its chemical stability with single&#8208;bond (B&#8722;O) sensitivity by exposure to controlled oxidizing conditions in ultrahigh vacuum.







Abstract
Bilayer (BL) two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) has recently been synthesized and computationally predicted to have promising physical properties for a variety of electronic and energy technologies. However, the fundamental chemical properties of BL borophene that form the foundation of practical applications remain unexplored. Here, we present atomic&#8208;level chemical characterization of BL borophene using ultrahigh vacuum tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV&#8208;TERS). UHV&#8208;TERS identifies the vibrational fingerprint of BL borophene with angstrom&#8208;scale spatial resolution. The observed Raman spectra are directly correlated with the vibrations of interlayer boron&#8211;boron bonds, validating the three&#8208;dimensional lattice geometry of BL borophene. By virtue of the single&#8208;bond sensitivity of UHV&#8208;TERS to oxygen adatoms, we demonstrate the enhanced chemical stability of BL borophene compared to its monolayer counterpart by exposure to controlled oxidizing atmospheres in UHV. In addition to providing fundamental chemical insight into BL borophene, this work establishes UHV&#8208;TERS as a powerful tool to probe interlayer bonding and surface reactivity of low&#8208;dimensional materials at the atomic scale.

         <title>Activation of Bulk Li2S as Cathode Material for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Organochalcogenide&#8208;Based Redox Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of oxidation reaction kinetics of bulk Li2S was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators. Among them, phenyl ditelluride can significantly lower the charge overpotential, accelerate the redox reaction kinetics, and alleviate the shuttle effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides. Consequently, the Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.







Abstract
Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising cathode material for sulfur&#8208;based batteries. However, its activation remains to be one of the key challenges against its commercialization. The extraction of Li+ from bulk Li2S has a high activation energy (Ea) barrier, which is fundamentally responsible for the initial large overpotential. Herein, a systematic investigation of accelerated bulk Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators, in which phenyl ditelluride (PDTe) can significantly reduce the Ea of Li2S and lower the initial charge potential. Simultaneously, it can alleviate the polysulfides shuttling effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides and converting them into insoluble lithium phenyl tellusulfides (PhTe&#8208;SxLi, x&gt;1). This alters the redox pathway and accelerates the reaction kinetics of Li2S cathode. Consequently, the Li||Li2S&#8208;PDTe cell shows excellent rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. The Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <title>Tailoring Extremely Narrow FWHM in Hypsochromic and Bathochromic Shift of Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin MR&#8208;TADF Materials for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic heteraborin multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent scaffolds (NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR) based on role&#8208;play with HOMO energy to achieve the extremely narrow FWHM of 14&#8197;nm were proposed and synthesized via lithium free one&#8208;shot double borylation. The organic light emitting diode employing the NO&#8208;DBMR/Cz&#8208;DBMR manifested state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with high color purity and external quantum efficiency of 29.8/33.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing double boron&#8208;based emitters with extremely narrow band spectrum and high efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is crucial and challenging. Herein, we report two materials, NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, hinge on polycyclic heteraborin skeletons based on role&#8208;play of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The NO&#8208;DBMR contains an oxygen atom, whereas the Cz&#8208;DBMR has a carbazole core in the double boron&#8208;embedded &#957;&#8208;DABNA structure. The synthesized materials resulted in an unsymmetrical pattern for NO&#8208;DBMR and surprisingly a symmetrical pattern for Cz&#8208;DBMR. Consequently, both materials showed extremely narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14&#8197;nm in hypsochromic (pure blue) and bathochromic (Bluish green) shifted emission without losing their high color fidelity. Furthermore, both materials show high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of over 82&#8201;%, and an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.04&#8197;eV, resulting in high reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC) of 105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the fabricated OLEDs based on these heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 33.7 and 29.8&#8201;% for NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow emission spectrum in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.

Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the fabricated OLEDs based on these heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 33.7 and 29.8&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;NO-DBMR&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Cz-DBMR&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow emission spectrum in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural&#8208;transformation&#8208;induced Drastic Luminescence Changes in an Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; Salt Triggered by Chemical Stimuli</title>

The large shift in luminescent properties between near&#8208;infrared and visible emissions without any loss in quantum yield was achieved by massive structural changes of an organic&#8211;inorganic luminescent hybrid.







Abstract
We synthesized a (1&#8208;propylpyridinium)2[ReN(CN)4]&#8208;type organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid exhibiting water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced drastic structural changes of the [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; assemblies. Specifically, upon exposure to water vapor, dehydrated nitrido&#8208;bridged chains were converted to hydrated cyanido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear clusters via rearrangements of large molecular building units in the crystals. These switchable assembly forms display substantially different photo&#8208;physical properties, although in both cases the emission is caused by a metal&#8208;centered d&#8211;d transition. The nitrido&#8208;bridged chain exhibited a near&#8208;infrared (749&#8197;nm) emission, which blue&#8208;shifted as the temperature increased, while a visible (561&#8197;nm) emission and its red shift was demonstrated by the cyanido&#8208;bridged cluster.

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;Fused Sterically Shielded Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Deep Blue OLEDs with Reduced Dexter Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically shielded yet extremely rigid multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitter (Tp&#8208;DABNA), based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core, has been developed. The bulky fins of the triptycene moieties enable Tp&#8208;DABNA to achieve narrowed emission and reduced Dexter energy transfer while maintaining efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. The corresponding deep blue OLEDs demonstrate a high EQE of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
Designing multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission and suppressed intermolecular interactions is challenging for realizing high color purity and stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a sterically shielded yet extremely rigid emitter based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core (Tp&#8208;DABNA) is proposed to address the issue. Tp&#8208;DABNA exhibits intense deep blue emissions with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a high horizontal transition dipole ratio, superior to the well&#8208;known bulky emitter, t&#8208;DABNA. The rigid MR skeleton of Tp&#8208;DABNA suppresses structural relaxation in the excited state, with reduced contributions from the medium&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrational modes to spectral broadening. The hyperfluorescence (HF) film composed of a sensitizer and Tp&#8208;DABNA shows reduced Dexter energy transfer compared to those of t&#8208;DABNA and DABNA&#8208;1. Notably, deep blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs with the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter display higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax=24.8&#8201;%) and narrower FWHMs (&#8804;26&#8197;nm) than t&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based OLEDs (EQEmax=19.8&#8201;%). The HF&#8208;OLEDs based on the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter further demonstrate improved performance with an EQEmax of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.

         <title>Photonic Modulation Enabled by Controlling the Edge Structures of Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) that were achieved by sequential cyclization. Three as&#8208;synthesized BMCs, featuring the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with controlled edges, display well&#8208;tunable aromatic structures, decreased band gaps and intriguing photonic properties. Notably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits unprecedented stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property.







Abstract
Control over topological edges of molecular carbons (MCs) is of importance for achieving diverse molecular topologies and desirable physical properties. However, it remains very challenging for heteroatom&#8208;doped MCs due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, we report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) via the sequential cyclization strategy. Three BMC molecules that feature the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with selective cove/fjord or cove/bay edges, respectively, were synthesized through the rational combination of Mallory photoreaction and Scholl reaction. We not only obtain the largest boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system reported so far, but also disclose that fine control of their edges and length greatly affects electronic structures and thereby photonic properties of BMCs, such as tunable aromaticity, decreased band gaps, as well as redshifted absorptions and fluorescence. Remarkably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property, both of which have never been reported for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems, thus demonstrating the potential of BMCs as optical gain materials for laser cavities.

         <title>Ruptenes: A Family of Terpene Analogs Give Insight into Cyclisation Mechanisms by Cascade Disruption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpenoid substrate analogs with a saturated C6&#8722;C7 bond were converted with terpene synthases. Their blocked reactivity caused interruption of the cyclisation cascade leading to ruptenes that represent cationic intermediates of the natural cyclisation reaction. Such intermediates are difficult to observe directly and thus the ruptenes deepen our understanding of terpene synthase catalysis.







Abstract
The terpenoid substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GGPP) and (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylfarnesyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP) were synthesised from (S)&#8208;citronellol and enzymatically converted with nine diterpene and two sesterterpene synthases, respectively. In two cases the substrate analogs were converted into diterpenes in cyclisation reactions corresponding to those observed for the native substrate GGPP, while the cyclisation cascade was disrupted or redirected in the other nine cases, leading to products that were named ruptenes. Several of the isolated ruptenes represent deprotonation products of cationic intermediates that are analogs of the intermediates proposed along the cyclisation cascades for the native substrates GGPP or GFPP, thus giving insights into the complex reaction mechanisms of terpene synthase mediated biosynthesis.

         <title>Highly Efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System in Piezo&#8208;catalytic Process for Organic Pollutants Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;cycled Fenton (PSF) system has been constructed. The rapid FeIII/FeII cycle couple with the greatly improved two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production kinetics, providing an exceptional Fenton degradation efficiency far exceeding that of the classical FeII PSF system.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;Fenton (PSF) system has been emerging as a promising technique for wastewater treatment, while the competing O2 reductive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and FeIII reduction seriously limited the reaction kinetics. Here, we develop a two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production (WOR&#8722;H2O2) coupled with FeIII reduction over a FeIII/BiOIO3 piezo&#8208;catalyst for highly efficient PSF. It is found that the presence of FeIII can simultaneously initiate the WOR&#8722;H2O2 and reduction of FeIII to FeII, thereby enabling a rapid reaction kinetics towards subsequent Fenton reaction of H2O2/FeII. The FeIII initiating PSF system offers exceptional self&#8208;recyclable degradation of pollutants with a degradation rate constant for sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) over 3.5 times as that of the classic FeII&#8208;PSF system. This study offers a new perspective for constructing efficient PSF systems and shatters the preconceived notion of FeIII in the Fenton reaction.

         <title>Unprecedented Chiral Three&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylamine, EA=Ethylamine) have been constructed by introducing chiral and achiral cations into the 3D &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic framework. The realization of 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provides a new route for developing chiral materials toward spintronics and chiroptoelectronics applications.







Abstract
Chiral three&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (3D HOIPs) would show unique chiroptoelectronic performance due to the combination of chirality and 3D structure. However, the synthesis of 3D chiral HOIPs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we constructed a pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylammonium, EA=ethylammonium), in which the large chiral cations can be contained in the big &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic frameworks induced by mixing cations. Notably, 3D 1&#8208;R/S shows natural chiroptical activity, as evidenced by its significant mirror circular dichroism spectra and the ability to distinguish circularly polarized light. Moreover, based on the unique 3D structure, 1&#8208;S presents sensitive X&#8208;ray detection performance with a low detection limit of 398&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is 14&#8197;times lower than the regular medical diagnosis of 5.5&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. In this work, 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provide a new route to develop chiral material in spintronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Tailoring Ion Ordering in Perovskite Oxide for High&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the ion ordering of perovskite and high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was investigated in PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948;. It was found that high&#8208;temperature OER activity was enhanced by the A&#8208;site cation ordering but suppressed by the oxygen vacancy ordering.







Abstract
Perovskites exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities as the anodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the relationship between ion ordering and OER performances is rarely investigated. Herein, a series of PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948; perovskites with tailored ion orderings are constructed. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the oxygen bulk migration and surface transport capacities as well as the OER activities are promoted by the A&#8208;site cation ordering, but weakened by the oxygen vacancy ordering. Hence, SOEC with the A&#8208;site&#8208;ordered and oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;disordered PrBaCo2O5+&#948; anode exhibits the highest performance of 3.40&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 2.0&#8197;V. This work sheds light on the critical role of ion orderings in the high&#8208;temperature OER performance and paves a new way for screening novel anode materials of SOECs.

         <title>Conformational Kinetics in Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: A Dynamic P/M Memory Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination between the conformational control of the pendant group in a chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) with the steric hindrance at the poly(diphenylacetylene) main chain results in the selective memorization of either P or M helical senses in the polymer.







Abstract
Dynamic P/M (plus/minus) helical memory in chiral dissymmetric poly(diphenylacetylene)s (PDPA) is shown using a PDPA that bears the benzamide of (L)&#8208;alanine methyl ester as pendant. For a single chiral polymer, it is possible to obtain either P or M helical structures in a specific solvent without the presence of any chiral external stimuli. To do that, it is necessary to combine the conformational control at the pendant group with a high steric hindrance at the backbone. In this case, by thermal annealing in low&#8208;polar solvents, an anti&#8208;conformer is stabilized at the pendant which commands a P helix in the PDPA. Next, solvent removal followed by addition of a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), results in the kinetic conformationally trapped P helix. However, in this medium, the preferred handedness and the thermodynamic macromolecular helix for poly&#8208;(L)&#8208;1 is M. This process also occurs in the opposite way. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) studies show that the dynamic memory effect is present both in ground and excited states.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Transfer Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose: High Monomeric Yield with Switchable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a hydrogen&#8208;transfer reductive catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose. By incorporating a hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride, high yields of aromatic monomers with switchable selectivity are achieved. Choline chloride greatly improves lignin dissolution and tailors the hydrogenolysis of lignin. The proposed strategy promotes the development of targeted lignin valorization and lignin&#8208;first biorefinery.







Abstract
Lignin solubilization and in situ hydrogenolysis are crucial for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulose to aromatic monomers. In this study, we reported a typical hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride (ChCl) to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;donating environment of the Ru/C&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose. The ChCl&#8208;tailored hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose was conducted under mild temperature and low&#8208;pressure (&lt;1&#8197;bar) conditions, which was applicable to other lignocellulosic biomass sources. We obtained an approximate theoretical yield of propylphenol monomer of 59.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 97.3&#8201;% using an optimal content of ChCl (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in ethylene glycol at 190&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h. When the content of ChCl in ethylene glycol was increased to 110&#8197;wt&#8201;%, the selectivity of propylphenol switched toward propylenephenol (yield of 36.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 87.6&#8201;%). The findings in this work provide valuable information for transforming lignin from lignocellulose into value&#8208;added products.

         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes with pinacolborane is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diboronates. The catalysts are generated in situ from Co(acac)2/dpephos and Co(acac)2/xantphos, respectively. The ring&#8208;opening of arylidenecyclopropanes to form single homoallylic cobalt intermediates via &#946;&#8208;C elimination is crucial for the obtained high regioselectivity.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access synthetically versatile skipped diboronates with catalysts generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and dpephos or xantphos. A variety of arylidenecyclopropanes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to form the corresponding 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;diboronates in high isolated yields and with high regioselectivity. Skipped diboronate products from these reactions can undergo various transformations to allow selective installation of two different functional groups along alkyl chains. Mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions combine cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes and hydroboration of homoallylic or allylic boronate intermediates.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides, generated in situ from 3&#8208;methyleneazetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides was described. A series of chiral quaternary prolineamide derivatives were obtained in excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition.







Abstract
We realized a highly efficient formal [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides generated from 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;azetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides. The employ of readily available chiral cobalt(II) complex of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide enabled the ring&#8208;expansion of azetidines, affording a variety of quaternary prolineamide derivatives with excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition. For the rearrangement of ammonium ylides, the installation of a pyrazoamide group as a masked brick to build chiral scaffolds proved successful. The enantioselective ring expansion process was elucidated by DFT calculations.

Polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME), were developed for precision cancer immunotherapy with minimized side effects.







Abstract
The efficacy of combination immunotherapy has been limited by tumor specificity and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs). Herein, we report the development of polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). PSPA is composed of sonosensitizers (semiconducting polymer) and STING agonists (MSA&#8208;2) via the GSH&#8208;activatable linkers. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, PSPA serves as a sonosensitizer to generate 1O2 and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant tumor cells. Furthermore, MSA&#8208;2 is released specifically in tumor microenvironment with highly expressed GSH, minimizing off&#8208;target side effects. The activation of the STING pathway elevates the interferon&#8208;&#946; level and synergizes with SDT to enhance the anti&#8208;tumor response. Therefore, this work proposes a universal approach for spatiotemporal regulation of cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Boron Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation via 1,2&#8208;boron shift to access enantioenriched gem&#8208;diborylalkenes. In this reaction, excellent enantioselectivities were obtained by simply improving the reaction temperature via an impressive DKR process. DFT calculations and extensive mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Asymmetric cross&#8208;couplings based on 1,2&#8208;carbon migration from B&#8208;ate complexes have been developed efficiently to access valuable organoboronates. However, enantioselective reactions triggered by 1,2&#8208;boron shift have remained to be unaddressed synthetic challenge. Here, Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation enabled by 1,2&#8208;boron shift was developed. In this reaction, we disclosed that excellent enantioselectivities were achieved through an interesting dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process of allylic carbonates at the elevated temperature. Notably, the highly valuable (bis&#8208;boryl)alkenes have enabled an array of diversifications to access versatile molecules. Extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism of DKR process and clarify the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric cross-couplings based on 1,2-carbon migration from B-ate complexes have been developed efficiently to access valuable organoboronates. However, enantioselective reactions triggered by 1,2-boron shift have remained to be unaddressed synthetic challenge. Here, Ir-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation enabled by 1,2-boron shift was developed. In this reaction, we disclosed that excellent enantioselectivities were achieved through an interesting dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process of allylic carbonates at the elevated temperature. Notably, the highly valuable (bis-boryl)alkenes have enabled an array of diversifications to access versatile molecules. Extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism of DKR process and clarify the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stable Hydrogen Production from Water and Lactic Acid via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis in a Porous Microreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term stable H2 production from H2O via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis using lactic acid as a sacrificial reagent and Pt/CdS as a photocatalyst is achieved in a porous microreactor (PP12), with a H2 production rate as high as 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. PP12 can be scaled up to a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2, without a decrease in H2 production efficiency, offering great potential for commercialization.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is significant to overcome challenges like fossil fuel depletion and carbon dioxide emission, but its efficiency is still far below that which is needed for commercialization. Herein, we achieve long&#8208;term stable H2 bubbling production from water (H2O) and lactic acid via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis in a porous microreactor (PP12); the catalytic system benefits from photocatalyst dispersion, charge separation, mass transfer, and dissociation of O&#8722;H bonds associated with H2O. With the widely used platinum/cadmium&#8208;sulfide (Pt/CdS) photocatalyst, PP12 leads to a H2 bubbling production rate of 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 1000&#8197;times higher than that in a traditional reactor. Even when amplifying PP12 into a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2 and extending the reaction time to 100&#8197;h, the H2 bubbling production rate still remains at around 600.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, offering great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Substituent Effect to Fine&#8208;Tune Energy Levels of Atom&#8208;Precise [MoOS3]2&#8722; Modified Copper(I) Thiolate Clusters Boosting Recyclable Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into copper clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters, which show high photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance.







Abstract
The propulsion of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is limited by the rational design and regulation of catalysts with precise structures and excellent activities. In this work, the [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into the CuI clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters of [Cu6(MoOS3)2(C6H5(CH2)S)2(P(C6H4&#8722;R)3)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xCH3CN (R=H, CH3, or F), which show high photocatalytic H2 evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects of the surface ligand, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the resultant visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance. Furthermore, MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters loaded onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 carriers significantly reduced the loss of catalysts in the collection process, efficiently addressing the recycling issues of such small cluster&#8208;based catalyst. This work not only highlights a competitively universal approach on the design of high&#8208;efficiency cluster photocatalysts for energy conversion, but also makes it feasible to manipulate the catalytic performance of clusters through a rational substituent strategy.

         <title>Blending Low&#8208;Frequency Vibrations and Push&#8211;Pull Effects Affords Superior Photoacoustic Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold, which met key requirements of high&#8208;quality PAI.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noninvasive in vivo imaging technique, has been widely used in clinical disease diagnosis. However, the design of high&#8208;performance PAI agents with three key characteristics, i.e., near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (&#955;abs&gt;800&#8197;nm), intense PA signals, and excellent photostability, remains a challenging goal. Herein, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering PAI agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA&#8208;approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; &#955;abs=788&#8197;nm), BDP1&#8208;NEt2 exhibited a UV/Vis&#8208;NIR spectrum peaked at 825&#8197;nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.

         <dc:description>
The 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocycle oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ) has been synthesized which features a semi&#8208;rigid N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture and is structurally chimeric to crown ethers and porphyrins. o&#8208;TQ has been shown to act as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand and adopt a bowl shape to capture a CuI cation. The copper complex exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission and can be used for supramolecular complexation and catalysis.







Abstract
A new 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocyclic molecular entity, oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ), was designed and synthesized. In o&#8208;TQ, three oxygen atoms were joined onto three quinoline units at the 2&#8208; and 8&#8208;positions in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion by three&#8208;fold SNAr reactions, giving rise to the characteristic N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture. o&#8208;TQ can serve as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand to capture a CuI cation and adopt a bowl shape, before supramolecular complexation with corannulene and [12]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) occurs through &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions. In the presence of the CuI cation, the non&#8208;emissive o&#8208;TQ becomes a highly emissive material in the solid state, whereby the emission wavelengths depend on the ancillary ligand on the CuI cation. The o&#8208;TQ/CuI complex is able to promote carbene catalysis to provide a range of enamines with a gem&#8208;difluorinated terminus.

&lt;p&gt;The 15-membered-macrocycle oxa-TriQuinoline (o-TQ) has been synthesized which features a semi-rigid N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; aza-oxa-crown architecture and is structurally chimeric to crown ethers and porphyrins. o-TQ has been shown to act as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand and adopt a bowl shape to capture a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation. The copper complex exhibits aggregation-induced emission and can be used for supramolecular complexation and catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A new 15-membered-macrocyclic molecular entity, oxa-TriQuinoline (o-TQ), was designed and synthesized. In o-TQ, three oxygen atoms were joined onto three quinoline units at the 2- and 8-positions in a head-to-tail fashion by three-fold S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reactions, giving rise to the characteristic N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; aza-oxa-crown architecture. o-TQ can serve as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand to capture a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation and adopt a bowl shape, before supramolecular complexation with corannulene and [12]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) occurs through &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions. In the presence of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation, the non-emissive o-TQ becomes a highly emissive material in the solid state, whereby the emission wavelengths depend on the ancillary ligand on the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation. The o-TQ/Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex is able to promote carbene catalysis to provide a range of enamines with a &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorinated terminus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Diversity in chemical reactivity unfolds even in the gas phase when noncovalent tools such as macrocyclic encapsulation are being used. Two distinct reaction pathways of a&#160;multifunctional bicyclic&#160;azoalkane (bottom) can be chemoselectively activated inside the cavity of a macrocycle (in gold), leading either to ejection of molecular dinitrogen (top) or ethylene (right),&#160;depending on its protonation state. In sharp contrast, the free substrate prefers to eject ammonia upon thermal activation (left), as reported by Werner&#8197;M. Nau, Elina Kalenius, Tung&#8208;Chun Lee et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303491).

The unambiguous assignment of NMR signals to complex organic molecules or mixtures is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202304196), Jin&#8197;Wook Cha, Min&#8208;Seon Kim, and Jin&#8208;Soo Park suggest an ultrahigh&#8208;resolution single&#8208;scan NMR method that enables to acquire a hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both 1H, 13C and their correlation spectra. The method was applied to compounds with high NMR signal complexity, such as chromopeptide and diastereomeric mixtures, and resulted in complete 1H and 13C NMR signal assignment of individual subunits and epimers.

O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes of membrane&#8208;bound mucin glycoproteins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. In their Research Article (e202302437), Ulrika Westerlind and co&#8208;workers describe the synthesis of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides using a chemoenzymatic approach. Starting from simple building blocks, Fmoc&#8208;protected glycosylated amino acids were prepared and incorporated into peptides and enzymatically diversified. Bacteria lectin interactions were then elucidated on glycopeptide microarrays.

A novel method based on in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry has been developed to capture the nascent intermediates&#160;during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8208;ZnO. The results shed light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8901;CH3, as described by Chengyuan Liu, Yang Pan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202304352).

         <title>The Chemistry of the Cyaphide Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
128&#8197;years after the erroneously assumed synthesis of sodium cyaphide, Na(CP), and 51&#8197;years after the definitive proof of the existence of HCP, the chemistry of the cyaphide anion has finally gained momentum. This review summarizes the chemistry of the cyaphide anion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;, from its beginnings to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art.







Abstract
We review the known chemistry of the cyaphide ion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;. This remarkable diatomic anion has been the subject of study since the late nineteenth century, however its isolation and characterization eluded chemists for almost a hundred years. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore the pioneering synthetic experiments that first allowed for its isolation, as well as more recent developments demonstrating that cyaphide transfer is viable in well&#8208;established salt&#8208;metathesis protocols. The physical properties of the cyaphide ion are also explored in depth, allowing us to compare and contrast the chemistry of this ion with that of its lighter congener cyanide (an archetypal strong field ligand and important organic functional group). Recent studies show that the cyaphide ion has the potential to be used as a versatile chemical regent for the synthesis of novel molecules and materials, hinting at many interesting future avenues of investigation.

         <title>Smart Materials Based on Synthetic Host Molecules: The Role of Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry in the Fabrication and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials that can respond to stimuli have the potential to revolutionize many fields such as the chemical and medical industries. This Minireview summarizes the recent development in smart materials based on synthetic host molecules (SHMs) and their associated host&#8211;guest chemistry. The role of the host&#8211;guest recognition in the material's fabrication and application is highlighted. Understanding the responsiveness of smart materials at the molecular level should empower researchers to design and prepare extremely intelligent systems that can complement the rising demands on automation and robotics.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive or smart materials have recently shown a significant impact on the frontier of material science and engineering. The exponential development of synthetic host molecules (SHMs) over the last decades and their corresponding host&#8211;guest chemistry, have empowered researchers with new opportunities to design and construct tailored or guest&#8208;specific smart materials. In this Minireview, we present the recent advancements in synthetic host based smart materials, ranging from the fabrication strategies to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications including adsorption, separation, luminescence, self&#8208;healing and actuation. The role that the host&#8211;guest chemistry plays in these systems is highlighted throughout to give a better prospective of the available possibilities for emerging materials of future economies.

         <title>Technological Pathways to Produce Compressed and Highly Pure Hydrogen from Solar Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review gives an overview of the technological pathways for direct and indirect production of H2 from solar power within the frame of the Innovation Pool project &#8220; Solar H2: Highly Pure and Compressed &#8221;. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal and plasma reactors are described in terms of their principle of operation and specifics regarding to the quality (purity, pressure) of produced H2.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) produced from renewables will have a growing impact on the global energy dynamics towards sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral standards. The share of green H2 is still too low to meet the net&#8208;zero target, while the demand for high&#8208;quality hydrogen continues to rise. These factors amplify the need for economically viable H2 generation technologies. The present article aims at evaluating the existing technologies for high&#8208;quality H2 production based on solar energy. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal reactors and plasma conversion utilize solar power directly or indirectly (as carbon&#8208;neutral electrons) and are reviewed from the perspective of their current development level, technical limitations and future potential.

         <title>Achieving White&#8208;Light Emission Using Organic Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be realized by purely organic phosphorescent emitters using either single&#8208;component or host&#8208;guest systems by mixing two fundamental colors (blue and yellow) or three primary colors (blue, green and red). Here we describe current strategies for achieving white phosphorescence at room&#8208;temperature using organic emitters.







Abstract
Artificial lighting currently consumes approximately one&#8208;fifth of global electricity production. Organic emitters with white persistent RTP have potential for applications in energy&#8208;efficient lighting technologies, due to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. Compared to heavy metal phosphorescent materials, they have significant advantages in cost, processability, and reduced toxicity. Phosphorescence efficiency can be improved by introducing heteroatoms, heavy atoms, or by incorporating luminophores within a rigid matrix. White&#8208;light emission can be achieved by tuning the ratio of fluorescence to phosphorescence intensity or by pure phosphorescence with a broad emission spectrum. This review summarizes recent advances in the design of purely organic RTP materials with white&#8208;light emission, describing single&#8208;component and host&#8208;guest systems. White phosphorescent carbon dots and representative applications of white&#8208;light RTP materials are also introduced.

         <title>Copper (I)&#8208;BOX Catalyzed Asymmetric 3&#8208;Component Reaction for the Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Propargylic Ethers and Anilines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of trifluoromethylated propargylic ethers and amines is described. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity using a simple chiral CuI&#8208;BOX system and tolerates a broad range of alcohol, aniline and alkyne substitution. With chiral alcohols, a high diastereoselectivity is observed, indicating good catalyst stereocontrol.







Abstract
An asymmetric 3&#8208;component reaction between EthynylBenziodoXoles (EBXs), 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane and nucleophiles catalyzed by a CuI&#8208;BOX (Bisoxazoline) catalyst is described. This protocol gives access to chiral trifluoromethylated propargyl ethers and anilines, which are valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity and yield with different nucleophiles such as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, as well as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor anilines. Aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes can be successfully introduced as electrophiles. In case of chiral substrates, high catalyst control was observed, leading to good diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Dihydrogen and Ethylene Activation by a Sterically Distorted Distibene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a hindered and highly distorted distibene complex capable of reacting with H2 and ethylene. NMR studies point to a feasible dissociation of the dimeric species into a fleeting stibinidene intermediate, which rapidly engages in reactivity. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity for SbI compounds provides crucial understanding towards the putative Sb redox catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a sterically distorted distibene ([4]2) and its transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity towards two fundamental feedstock chemicals: H2 and ethylene. Although [4]2 exhibits an unusually long Sb=Sb distance and noticeable backbone distortion in the solid state, NMR data suggest that [4]2 remains predominantly as a dimer in solution, even at high temperatures. However, it was proposed that the elusive reactivity of [4]2 toward H2 and ethylene results from reversible dissociation of [4]2 into the transient stibinidene ([4]), which could be observed by NMR spectroscopic techniques.

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Nitromethane to Construct Isoxazoline Aldoximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented approach to isoxazoline aldoximes via the reactions of nitromethane and olefins is achieved. Nitromethane is electrochemically activated to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes.







Abstract
Activation of nitromethane to endow new reactivity is an interesting and meaningful but also challenging topic. Herein, we report an electrochemical activation of nitromethane to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes. The isoxazoline aldoximes that are prepared by four steps with the reported strategy are synthesized in a single step from low&#8208;cost and readily available nitromethane and olefins with moderate to excellent yields under our electrochemical conditions. The reaction also takes advantage of high atom&#8208;economy and E&#8208;selectivity. Moreover, the mechanism is studied by control experiments, a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study, cyclic voltammogram (CV) experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanistic results reveal that nitromethane may be activated under electrochemical conditions to deliver a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole 2&#8208;oxide intermediate, which undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with olefins to yield isoxazoline aldoximes.

         <title>Synthetic Modulation of an Unstable Dehydrosecodine&#8208;type Intermediate and Its Encapsulation into a Confined Cavity Enable Its X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Observation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a labile dehydrosecodine&#8208;type intermediate was achieved by designing a functionally modulated analogue, enabling its inclusion within a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage. The unique folded conformation of this intermediate, stabilized inside the hydrophobic cavity, was supported by DFT calculations and supports the postulation of its involvement in divergent metabolic pathways to various monoterpene indole alkaloids.







Abstract
Numerous indole alkaloids such as the iboga&#8208; and aspidosperma&#8208;type are believed to be biosynthesized via a common hypothetical intermediate, dehydrosecodine. The highly reactive nature of dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compounds has hampered their isolation and structural elucidation. In this study, we achieved the first X&#8208;ray structural determination of a dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compound by integrating synthetic optimization of the reactivity and stabilizing the fragile molecule by encapsulation into a supramolecular host. Formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex of the dehydrosecodine&#8208;type labile guest bearing both vinyl indole and dihydropyridine units with the host was observed. This integrated approach not only provides insights into the biosynthetic conversions but also allows stabilization and storage of the reactive and otherwise short&#8208;lived intermediate within the confined hydrophobic cavity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Thiamyxins A&#8211;C and Thiamyxin E, a Potent Class of RNA&#8208;Virus&#8208;Inhibiting (Cyclo)depsipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first total synthesis of thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and E, an interesting group of natural products with antiviral activity and an acid&#8208;labile C2 exomethine position, is described. Overcoming the problem of inseparable diastereomers of the open&#8208;chain variants, thiamyxin&#8197;C and E were obtained by opening the cyclic thiamyxins&#8197;A and B.







Abstract
We present the first total synthesis of the thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and the now fully characterized thiamyxin&#8197;E, an interesting class of thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich depsipeptides with diverse antiviral activity. The synthesis features a parallel closing of two methyl thiazoline units, with low epimerization of the very labile adjacent stereocenter. It also includes the three&#8208;step synthesis of an uncommon hydroxy acid and the oxidation&#8208;free elimination of a phenylselenide to form a dehydroalanine moiety. The exploitation of the acid&#8208;labile stereocenter at the isoleucine moiety and the reopening of the macrolactones gave access to the four thiamyxins with good yields and diastereomeric purities from a single precursor. The modular total synthesis allows further testing of the biological activity and gives opportunities to explore the pharmacophore and antiviral target through derivatization.

         <title>Observation of Confinement&#8208;Free Neutral Group Three Transition Metal Carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl Sc(CO)7 and octacarbonyl TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) complexes have been prepared using a laser vaporization&#8208;supersonic expansion source and characterized by size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy. Theoretical analyses show that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase.







Abstract
Spectroscopic characterization of neutral highly&#8208;coordinated compounds is essential in fundamental and applied research, but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in mass selection. Here, we report the preparation and size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet (IR&#8208;VUV) spectroscopic identification of group&#8208;3 transition metal carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) in the gas phase, which are the first confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes. The results indicate that Sc(CO)7 has a C2v structure and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) have a D4h structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. These highly&#8208;coordinated carbonyls are 17&#8208;electron complexes when only those valence electrons that occupy metal&#8722;CO bonding orbitals are considered, in which the ligand&#8208;only 4b1u molecular orbital is ignored. This work opens new avenues toward the design and chemical control of a large variety of compounds with unique structures and properties.

         <title>Photosensitized [4+2]&#8208; and [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of N&#8208;Sulfonylimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions and azetidine&#8208;forming [2+2] cycloadditions (aza&#8208;Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions) of sulfonylimines are presented. The divergent reactivity was achieved though substrate modulation. In both cases, the reactions lead to the synthesis of complex polycyclic scaffolds from simple components. The mechanistic details and the utility of the products are described.







Abstract
The synthesis of polycyclic compounds is of high interest due to the prevalence of these motifs in drugs and natural products. Herein, we report on the stereoselective construction of 3D bicyclic scaffolds and azetidine derivatives by modulation of N&#8208;sulfonylimines to achieve either [4+2]&#8208; or [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. The utility of the method was established by further modulation of the product. Mechanistic studies are also included, which support reaction via Dexter energy transfer.

         <title>Direct Observation of the Ethyl Radical in the Pyrolysis of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We directly detect the ethyl radical intermediate in ethane pyrolysis for the first time, and reveal new insights into the reaction mechanism based upon our observations. This advance was enabled by a combination of isotopic microreactor studies, master equation based kinetics calculations, and threshold photoelectron&#8208;photoion coincidence spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report the first direct detection of ethyl radical in the pyrolysis of ethane. Observation of this vital intermediate was made possible in this extremely reactive environment by the use of a microreactor coupled with synchrotron radiation and photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy, despite its short lifetime and low concentration. Together with ab&#8208;initio master equation&#8208;calculated rates and fully coupled computational fluid dynamics simulations, our measurements show that even under the low pressures and short residence times in our experiment, ethyl formation can only be explained by bimolecular reactions; the most important is the catalytic attack of ethane by H atoms, which are then regenerated by decomposition of the nascent ethyl radicals. Our results complete the observation of all hypothesized intermediates in this industrially important process and highlight the need for further studies under additional conditions using similar methods to improve existing models and optimize process chemistries.

         <title>Elusive Double Perovskite Iodides: Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unicorn double perovskite iodides [A2MIMIIII6] are elusive, but with the help of rational design rules, can indeed be synthesized. The Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy) family demonstrate optical properties that are red shifted compared to related halide materials and their magnetic properties show weak interaction parameters.







Abstract
Halide double perovskites [A2MIMIIIX6] are an important class of materials that have garnered substantial interest as non&#8208;toxic alternatives to conventional lead iodide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. While numerous studies have examined chloride and bromide double perovskites, reports of iodide double perovskites are rare, and their definitive structural characterization has not been reported. Predictive models have aided us here in the synthesis and characterization of five iodide double perovskites of general formula Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy). The complete crystal structures, structural phase transitions, optical, photoluminescent, and magnetic properties of these compounds are reported.

         <title>Preparation and Reactivity Study of a Versatile Trifluoromethylthiolating Agent: S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Trifluoromethanesulfonothioate (TTST)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel CF3S reagent named TTST has been prepared in one step using commercially inexpensive materials. TTST is easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, highly reactive, and can be used to prepare many CF3S reagents. TTST can generate one CF3S+, two CF3S&#8722;, or both CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. TTST exhibits high atom economy&#8211;all atoms except the oxygens can be used. TTST enabled to reach a new type of molecule, ArOSCF3, and revealed a novel catalytic CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement.







Abstract
A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF3SO2SCF3 (1), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF3SO2Na and Tf2O. 1 is a highly versatile and atom&#8208;efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF3S+, two equivalents of CF3S&#8722;, or a combination of CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. Many high&#8208;yielding CF3S reactions of C, O, S, and N&#8208;nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple&#8208;step preparations of many reported CF3S reagents. 1 delivered a hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize ArOSCF3 that was followed by a novel CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph3P combinations, 1 generated two equivalents of CF3S anion species, and the photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenes with 1 provided CF3/CF3S&#8208;containing products in high atom&#8208;efficiency.

TTST is easy-to-handle, highly reactive, and can be used to prepare many CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S reagents. TTST can generate one CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, two CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, or both CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8901;/CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; species. TTST exhibits high atom economy&#8211;all atoms except the oxygens can be used. TTST enabled to reach a new type of molecule, ArOSCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and revealed a novel catalytic CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-rearrangement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na and Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is a highly versatile and atom-efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, two equivalents of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, or a combination of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8901;/CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; species. Many high-yielding CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S reactions of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple-step preparations of many reported CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S reagents. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; delivered a hitherto hard-to-synthesize ArOSCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that was followed by a novel CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P combinations, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; generated two equivalents of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S anion species, and the photo-catalyzed reactions of alkenes with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; provided CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S-containing products in high atom-efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalytic Platform for the Activation of Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with light, can activate via single electron reduction a wide variety of typically inert electron&#8208;rich substrates, including strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The protocol is also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates, exhibiting high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Due to their strong covalent bonds and low reduction potentials, activating inert substrates is challenging. Recent advances in photoredox catalysis offered a number of solutions, each of which useful for activating specific inert bonds. Developing a general catalytic platform that can consistently target a broad range of inert substrates would be synthetically useful. Herein, we report a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with 405&#8197;nm light, acquires a strongly reducing power. This excited&#8208;state reactivity served to activate, by single&#8208;electron reduction, strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic platform was versatile enough to promote the reduction of generally recalcitrant electron&#8208;rich substrates (Ered&lt;&#8722;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE), including arenes that afforded 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. The protocol was also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates with a high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies identified an excited&#8208;state thiolate anion as responsible of the highly reducing reactivity.

         <title>Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Amide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a protocol for the reduction of amides to amines using a cationic BiIII catalyst with a tridentate ligand framework in combination with a simple and cheap silane as the reducing agent. Various amides can be reduced and a variety of functional groups can be tolerated. Kinetic analyses and modelling were used to elucidate the orders of each component and to generate a kinetic model that is in agreement with the observed experimental data.







Abstract
In this article we report that a cationic version of Akiba's BiIII complex catalyzes the reduction of amides to amines using silane as hydride donor. The catalytic system features low catalyst loadings and mild conditions, en route to secondary and tertiary aryl&#8208; and alkylamines. The system tolerates functional groups such as alkene, ester, nitrile, furan and thiophene. Kinetic studies on the reaction mechanism result in the identification of a reaction network with an important product inhibition that is in agreement with the experimental reaction profiles.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes with Internal Olefins</title>

         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes and internal olefins has been developed, providing a wide range of multisubstituted gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes. This reaction shows an example where the &#8220;CF2&#8221; motif can be kept upon ring extension. The process is atom&#8208;economic and allows to reach numerous gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules represents a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) and internal olefins has been developed, enabling the efficient synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good functional group compatibility, excellent regioselectivity and good diastereoselectivity. The resulting gem&#8208;difluorinated products can undergo downstream transformations to access various mono&#8208;fluorinated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This reaction demonstrates the use of gem&#8208;DFCPs as a type of &#8220;CF2&#8221; C3 synthon for cycloaddition under transition metal catalysis, which provides potential strategy for synthesizing other gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules.

         <title>A Divergent Polyene Cyclization for the Total Synthesis of Greenwayodendrines, Greenwaylactams, Polysin and Polyveoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of nine alkaloid sesquiterpenoids has been accomplished in only 5&#8211;8&#8197;steps in excellent overall yield (3&#8211;21&#8201;%). The dual nucleophilicity of the indole enabled two divergent termination pathways to be unlocked: an unprecedented N&#8208;termination and a previously challenging C&#8208;termination step. Furthermore, a bioinspired late&#8208;stage Witkop oxidation enabled the first total synthesis of greenwaylactams A&#8722;C.







Abstract
We present a concise asymmetric total synthesis (5&#8211;8&#8197;steps) of nine sesquiterpenoid alkaloids featuring four different tetra&#8208;/pentacyclic scaffolds. To this end, a novel, bioinspired indole N&#8208;terminated cationic tricyclization has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of greenwayodendrines and polysin. Subtle variation of the C2&#8208;substituted indole cyclization precursor allowed switching between indole N&#8208; and C&#8208;termination. For the latter, a subsequent Witkop oxidation enabled conversion of the cyclopentene&#8208;fused indole into the eight&#8208;membered benzolactam to directly furnish the family of greenwaylactams. In addition, a diastereomeric C&#8208;termination product has been elaborated to provide access to polyveoline.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the scientists in the Highly Operational Team (HOT) led by the Shustova group from the University of South Carolina (USA). HOT researchers are located at four universities (the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, the University of Florida, and Chulalongkorn University) and one national laboratory (Savannah River National Laboratory) from two different countries, USA and Thailand. The team recently published an article using the synergy among the HOT participants to reveal the synthetic pathways toward preparation of transuranic heterometallic extended metal&#8211;organic materials, providing mechanistic details for their formation, and establishing a structure&#8211;property relationship: &#8220;f&#8208;block MOFs: A Pathway to Heterometallic Transuranics&#8221;, K.&#8197;C.

         <title>A Radical Pathway and Stabilized Li Anode Enabled by Halide Quaternary Ammonium Electrolyte Additives for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of the sulfur cathode by insulating lithium sulfide restricts the reversibility and sulfur utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. 3D nucleation of Li2S enabled by radical conversion may significantly boost the redox kinetics. Electrolytes with high donor number (DN) solvents allow for tri&#8208;sulfur (S3&#8226;&#8722;) radicals as intermediates, however, the catastrophic reactivity of such solvents with Li anodes pose a great challenge for their practical application. Here, we propose the use of quaternary ammonium salts as electrolyte additives, which can preserve the partial high&#8208;DN characteristics that trigger the S3&#8226;&#8722; radical pathway, and inhibit the growth of Li dendrites. Li&#8208;S batteries with tetrapropylammonium bromide (T3Br) electrolyte additive deliver the outstanding cycling stability (700 cycles at 1 C with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle), and high capacity under a lean electrolyte of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1. This work opens a new avenue for the development of electrolyte additives for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Steric Hindrance of Porous Organic Polymers in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes to Induce the Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium fluoride (LiF) at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) contributes to the stable operation of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Currently, most of the methods for constructing lithium fluoride SEI are based on the design of polar groups of fillers. However, the mechanism behind how steric hindrance of fillers impacts LiF formation remains unclear. This study synthesizes three kinds of porous polyacetal amides (PAN&#8208;X, X=NH2, NH&#8208;CH3, N&#8208;(CH3)2) with varying steric hindrances by regulating the number of methyl substitutions of nitrogen atoms on the reaction monomer, which are incorporated into polymer composite solid electrolytes, to investigate the regulation mechanism of steric hindrance on the content of lithium fluoride in SEI. The results show that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8208;) will compete for the charge without steric effect, while excessive steric hindrance hinders the interaction between TFSI&#8208; and polar groups, reducing charge acquisition. Only when one hydrogen atom on the amino group is replaced by a methyl group, steric hindrance from the methyl group prevents TFSI&#8208; from capturing charge in that direction, thereby facilitating the transfer of charge from the polar group to a separate TFSI&#8208; and promoting maximum LiF formation. This work provides a novel perspective on constructing LiF&#8208;rich SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report for the first time that Pd nanocrystals can absorb H via a &#8220;single&#8208;phase pathway&#8221; when particles with a proper combination of shape and size are used. Specifically, when Pd icosahedral nanocrystals of 7&#8208; and 12&#8208;nm in size are exposed to H atoms, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide each particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of phase boundaries is no longer favored. As such, absorption of H atoms is dominated by the single&#8208;phase pathway and one can readily obtain PdHx with any x in the range of 0&#8722;0.7. When switched to Pd octahedral nanocrystals, the single&#8208;phase pathway is only observed for particles of 7 nm in size. We also establish that the H&#8208;absorption kinetics will be accelerated if there is a tensile strain in the nanocrystals due to the increase in lattice spacing. Besides the unique H&#8208;absorption behaviors, the PdHx (x = 0&#8211;0.7) icosahedral nanocrystals show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward the formic acid oxidation because of the decrease in chemical potential for H atoms in a Pd lattice under tensile strain.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Borylcyclopropanation of Alkenes with a (Diborylmethyl)iodide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane skeletons play a prominent role in the development of organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a stable, multifunctional (diborylmethyl)iodide reagent (CHI(Bpin)2) for the photoinduced cyclopropanation of alkenes, providing an array of 1,2&#8208;substituted cyclopropylboronates in good yields. This &#945;&#8208;haloboronic ester can be readily synthesized on a multigram scale from commercially available starting materials. Furthermore, this protocol displays high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, excellent functional group tolerance, and allows for late&#8208;stage borylcyclopropanation of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the borylcyclopropanation proceeds via a radical addition/polar cyclization pathway mediated by the photocatalyst fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 and visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Photochromic&#8208;Photothermal Processes for Catalytic Plastic Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating high&#8208;energy ultraviolet (UV) photons into photothermal catalytic processes may enable photothermal&#8208;photochemical synergistic catalysis, which represents a transformative technology for waste plastic recycling. The major challenge is avoiding side reactions and by&#8208;products caused by these energetic photons. Here, we break through the limitation of the existing photothermal conversion mechanism and propose a photochromic&#8208;photothermal catalytic system based on polyol&#8208;ligated TiO2 nanocrystals. Upon UV or sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols can rapidly capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. The resulting abundant defect energy levels boost sunlight&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, and simultaneously the oxygen vacancies facilitate polyester glycolysis by activating the nucleophilic addition&#8208;elimination process. As a result, compared to commercial TiO2 (P25), we achieve 6&#8208;fold and 12.2&#8208;fold performance enhancements under thermal and photothermal conditions, respectively, while maintaining high selectivity to high&#8208;valued monomers. This paradigm&#8208;shift strategy directs energetic UV photons for activating catalysts and avoids their interaction with reactants, opening the possibility of substantially elevating the efficiency of more solar&#8208;driven catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds ((CH3)2C(PhY)&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)PhY) were prepared by selective cationic dimerization of &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene (&#945;MS) derivatives (CH2=C(CH3)PhY) with p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) via &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H scision. They were subsequently used as reversible chain transfer agents for sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization of &#945;MS via &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;C scission in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts such as SnCl4. In particular, exo&#8208;olefin compounds with electron&#8208;donating substituents, such as a 4&#8208;MeO group (Y) on the aromatic ring, worked as efficient cationic RAFT agents for &#945;MS to produce poly(&#945;MS) with controlled molecular weights and exo&#8208;olefin terminals. Other exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)(4&#8208;MeOPh)) with various R groups were prepared by different methods to examine the effects of R groups on the cationic RAFT polymerization. A sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization also proceeded for isobutylene (IB) with the exo&#8208;olefin &#945;MS dimer ((CH3)2C(Ph)&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)Ph). Furthermore, telechelic poly(IB) with exo&#8208;olefins at both terminals was obtained with a bifunctional RAFT agent containing two exo&#8208;olefins. Finally, block copolymers of &#945;MS and MMA were prepared via mechanistic transformation from cationic to radical RAFT polymerization using exo&#8208;olefin terminals containing 4&#8208;MeOPh groups as common sulfur&#8208;free RAFT groups for both cationic and radical polymerizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coupling in Anti&#8208;Perovskite Nitride via Cation Doping for Efficient Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complexes of metal center and nitrogen ligands are the most representative systems for catalyzing hydrogenation reactions in small molecule conversion. Developing heterogenous catalysts with similar active metal&#8208;nitrogen functional centers, nevertheless, still remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that the metal&#8208;nitrogen coupling in anti&#8208;perovskite Co4N can be effective modulated by Cu doping to form Co3CuN, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation process during electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;RR) to ammonia. The combination of advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that Cu dopants strengthen the Co&#8208;N bond and upshifted the metal d&#8208;band towards the Fermi level, promoting the adsorption of NO3&#8208; and *H and facilitating the transition from *NO2/*NO to *NO2H/*NOH. Consequently, the Co3CuN delivers noticeably better NO3&#8208;RR activity than the pristine Co4N, with optimal Faradaic efficiency of 97% and ammonia yield of 455.3 mmol h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance heterogenous catalyst for electrochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective 1,4&#8208;Oxyamination of Conjugated gem&#8208;Difluorodienes via Coupling with Carboxylic Acids and Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes afforded 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives in excellent 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeded via rhodium(III) catalysis through an &#951;3&#8208;allyl intermediate.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine atoms in organics improves their bioactivity and lipophilicity. Catalytic functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorodienes represents one of the most straightforward approaches to access fluorinated alkenes. In contrast to the regular 1,3&#8208;dienes that undergo diverse asymmetric di/hydrofunctionalizations, the regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes remains untouched.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Difluoromethylation&#8208;Alkynylation of Olefins by Solving the Dilemma between Acidities and Reduction Potentials of Difluoromethylating Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and substituent constants (&#963;) of aryl difluoromethyl sulfones provides a powerful strategy to solve the dilemma of acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. The strategy enabled achieving enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation reactions of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone.







Abstract
Molecules containing a difluoromethyl group or a propargylic stereocenter are widely used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and 1,2&#8208;functionalization of olefins is an important method for introducing the two groups into molecules simultaneously. The construction of the propargylic stereocenter with terminal alkynes usually requires bases. However, difluoromethylating agents with high reduction potentials often decompose in the presence of bases because of their acidities, and those with low reduction potentials are stable but difficult to undergo the desired single electron transfer (SET) reduction. Using the linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and Hammett substituent constants (&#963;) of difluoromethyl aryl sulfones, we solved the dilemma between acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. Herein, we report the first enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone with high enantioselectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). We also extended this asymmetric fluoroalkylation&#8208;alkynylation reaction with other fluoroalkyl sulfones, which enabled efficient installation of trifluoromethyl, difluoroalkyl, difluorobenzyl, (benzenesulfonyl)&#8208;difluoromethyl and monofluoromethyl groups into products.

         <title>Unlocking Reversible Silicon Redox for High&#8208;Performing Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible Si redox has been unlocked in Cl&#8208;based batteries through rational electrolyte dilution and anode passivation, which demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and high practicability. It enables us to revisit the overlooked Cl&#8208;based batteries and to harness them for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage.







Abstract
Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;based batteries such as Li/Cl2 batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl&#8208;based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well&#8208;documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl&#8208;based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl&#8208;based batteries. Here we show, for the first time, reversible Si redox in Cl&#8208;based batteries through efficient electrolyte dilution and anode/electrolyte interface passivation using 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane and cyclized polyacrylonitrile as key mediators. Our Si anode chemistry enables significantly increased cycling stability and shelf lives compared with conventional Li metal anodes. It also avoids the use of a large excess of anode materials, thus enabling the first rechargeable Cl2 full battery with remarkable energy and power densities of 809&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 4,277&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively. The Si anode chemistry affords fast kinetics with remarkable rate capability and low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, indicating its great potential in practical applications.

         <title>Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity as Solid Ion Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes based on polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) are proposed as ideal solid electrolytes for lithium batteries. Benefiting from rational material selection and structure design, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries deliver high discharge specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and prolonged cycling life (247&#8197;cycles). The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries can operate steadily for over 100&#8197;cycles after a series of abuse tests (bending and twisting).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity and superior stability are considered to be a key technology for the safe operation of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, current SSEs are incapable of meeting the requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here we report a general strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance SSEs by engineering polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs). Taking advantage of the interconnected ion pathways generated from the ionizable groups, high ionic conductivity (1.06&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) is achieved for the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs. The mechanically strong (50.0&#8197;MPa) and non&#8208;flammable SSEs combine the two superiorities of outstanding Li+ conductivity and electrochemical stability, which can restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short&#8208;circuiting even after more than 2200&#8197;h cycling. Benefiting from the rational design of SSEs, PIMs&#8208;based SSEs Li&#8208;metal batteries can achieve good cycling performance and superior feasibility in a series of withstand abuse tests including bending, cutting, and penetration. Moreover, the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs endow high specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (247&#8197;cycles) for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The PIMs&#8208;based SSEs present a powerful strategy for enabling safe operation of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C(sp2)&#8722;F Bond Alkylation of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefin HFO&#8208;1234yf</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of inexpensive industrial chemical HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents has been developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the less electron&#8208;rich pyridine&#8208;oxazoline or bipyridine&#8208;based ligands feature comparable or even higher rates of C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands in the presence of lithium bromide.







Abstract
The selective transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization of inexpensive industrial fluorochemicals represents one of the most attractive approaches to valuable fluorinated compounds. However, the selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond carbofunctionalization of refrigerant hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) remains challenging. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents. The resulting 2&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes can serve as a versatile synthon for diversified transformations, including the anti&#8208;Markovnikov type hydroalkylation and the synthesis of bioactive molecule analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that lithium salt is essential to promote the oxidative addition of Ni0(Ln) to the C&#8722;F bond; the less electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;based ligands, such as bipyridine and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, feature comparable or even higher oxidative addition rates than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands; the strong &#963;&#8208;donating phosphine ligands, such as PMe3, are detrimental to transmetallation, but the less electron&#8208;rich and bulky N&#8208;based ligands, such as pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, facilitate transmetallation and reductive elimination to form the final product.

The resulting 2-trifluoromethylalkenes can serve as a versatile synthon for diversified transformations, including the &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov type hydroalkylation and the synthesis of bioactive molecule analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that lithium salt is essential to promote the oxidative addition of Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C&#8722;F bond; the less electron-rich &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-based ligands, such as bipyridine and pyridine-oxazoline, feature comparable or even higher oxidative addition rates than the electron-rich phosphine ligands; the strong &#963;-donating phosphine ligands, such as PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are detrimental to transmetallation, but the less electron-rich and bulky &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-based ligands, such as pyridine-oxazoline, facilitate transmetallation and reductive elimination to form the final product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions through Fragment Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linked fragments for molecular glue development for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are described. Two classes of fragments were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule that was further optimized, guided by 20 crystal structures, resulting in a selective 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; PPIs.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule stabilization of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy in chemical biology and drug discovery. However, the systematic discovery of PPI stabilizers remains a largely unmet challenge. Herein we report a fragment&#8208;linking approach targeting the interface of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and a peptide derived from the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) protein. Two classes of fragments&#8212;a covalent and a noncovalent fragment&#8212;were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule in which the original fragment interactions were largely conserved. Supported by 20 crystal structures, this initial hybrid molecule was further optimized, resulting in selective, 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; interaction. The high&#8208;resolution structures of both the single fragments, their co&#8208;crystal structures and those of the linked fragments document a feasible strategy to develop orthosteric PPI stabilizers by linking to an initial tethered fragment.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Responsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Capsule Displaying Unusual Encapsulation&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative assembly of bent amphiphiles with two ferrocene units leads to a ferrocene&#8208;based capsule in water. Besides redox&#8208;responsive disassembly/assembly properties, the new capsule displays unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions upon encapsulation of electron&#8208;accepting molecules in the multi&#8208;ferrocene cavity. The CT interactions are facilely dissociated by a redox&#8208;triggered stimulus.







Abstract
A ferrocene&#8208;based capsule is spontaneously and quantitatively formed in water by the assembly of bent amphiphiles carrying two ferrocene units. The disassembly and assembly of the new organometallic capsule, with a well&#8208;defined and highly condensed ferrocene core, are demonstrated by chemical redox stimuli in a fully reversible fashion under ambient conditions. In contrast to previously reported multiferrocene assemblies, only the present capsule efficiently encapsulates typical organic/inorganic dyes as well as electron&#8208;accepting molecules in water. As a result, unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, displaying relatively wide absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;=650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm), are observed upon the encapsulation of acceptors (i.e., chloranil and TCNQ). The resultant encapsulation&#8208;induced CT interactions can be released by a redox stimulus through the disassembly of the capsule.

         <title>Achieving Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long persistent luminescence (LPL) of 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites based on the self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. Through doping engineering, the LPL decay time is increased, the emission color is adjustable, and the thermal stability of PL enhances dramatically. Furthermore, we highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;halide perovskites have been enriched over recent years to offer remarkable features from diverse chemical structures and environmental stability endowed with exciting functionalities in photoelectric detectors and phosphorescence systems. However, the low conversion efficiency of singlet to triplet in 2D hybrid halide perovskites reduces phosphorescence lifetimes. In this study, the long persistent luminescence of 2D all&#8208;inorganic perovskites with a self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. The results show that the decay time of the long persistent luminescence increases from 450&#8197;s to 600&#8197;s, and the luminescence color changes from cyan to orange, and the thermal stability of photoluminescence enhances dramatically after replacing Cd2+ by appropriate Mn2+ ions in 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites. Furthermore, diversified anti&#8208;counterfeiting modes are fabricated to highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems with tunable persistent luminescence in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Therefore, our studies provide a novel model for realizing tunable long persistent luminescence of perovskite with 2D self&#8208;assembled layered structure for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry makes the next move in advancing organometallic synthesis. In their Research Article (e202305775), Riina Aav, Dzmitry G. Kananovich et&#8197;al. report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes the limitations of the classic solvent&#8208;based approach. Mechanochemical activation enables the rapid generation of Grignard reagents&#160;in situ, making the process resistant to air and allowing solid Br&#248;nsted acids to be used as additives to improve yields.

         <title>An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Tackling Conformational Energy Uncertainties in Chiroptical Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assignment of the absolute configuration of chiral compounds critically depends on the comparison with predictions of chiroptical spectra with intrinsically inaccurate quantum chemical calculations. Wybren&#8197;Jan Buma, Valentin&#8197;Paul Nicu et&#8197;al. report in their Research Article (e202307053) a novel protocol based on genetic algorithm analyses and hierarchical clustering that overcomes these inaccuracies as demonstrated by the elucidation of the absolute configuration and conformational landscape of natural products derived from the Haliclona sp. marine sponge.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Water and Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2O2 is a significant chemical widely utilized in the environmental and industrial fields, with growing global demand. Without sacrificial agents, simultaneously photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels from seawater is green and sustainable but still challenging. Herein, two novel thiophene&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (TD&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF) were first constructed and served as catalysts for H2O2 synthesis via indirect 2e&#8208; ORR and direct 2e&#8208; WOR channels. The photocatalytic H2O2 production performance can be regulated by adjusting the N&#8208;heterocycle modules (pyridine and triazine) in COFs. Notably, with no sacrificial agents, just using air and water as raw materials, TD&#8208;COF exhibited high H2O2 production yields of 4060 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, and 3364 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 in deionized water and natural seawater, respectively. Further computational mechanism studies revealed that the thiophene was the primary photoreduction unit for ORR, while the benzene ring (linked to the thiophene by the imine bond) was the central photooxidation unit for WOR. The current work exploits thiophene&#8208;containing COFs for overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via ORR and WOR dual channels and provides fresh insight into creating innovative catalysts for photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Microbial Corrosion by Magnetite and Electrically Conductive Pili through Direct Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;Microbe Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrobiocorrosion, the process in which microbes extract electrons from metallic iron (Fe0) through direct Fe0&#8208;microbe electrical connections, is thought to contribute to the costly corrosion of iron&#8208;containing metals that impacts many industries. However, electrobiocorrosion mechanisms are poorly understood. We report here that electrically conductive pili (e&#8208;pili) and the conductive mineral magnetite play an important role in the electron transfer between Fe0 and Geobacter sulfurreducens, the first microbe in which electrobiocorrosion has been rigorously documented. Genetic modification to express poorly conductive pili substantially diminished corrosive pitting and rates of Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;microbe electron flux. Magnetite reduced resistance to electron transfer, increasing corrosion currents and intensifying pitting. Studies with mutants suggested that the magnetite promoted electron transfer in a manner similar to the outer&#8208;surface c&#8208;type cytochrome OmcS. These findings, and the fact that magnetite is a common product of iron corrosion, suggest a potential positive feedback loop of magnetite produced during corrosion further accelerating electrobiocorrosion. The interactions of e&#8208;pili, cytochromes, and magnetite demonstrate mechanistic complexities of electrobiocorrosion, but also provide insights into detecting and possibly mitigating this economically damaging process.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Lewis Acid&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium&#8208;Aryloxide Catalysis: Pyrazolone Addition to Nitroolefins as Entry to Diaminoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. A polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst which enables their addition to nitroolefins with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol is presented. DFT studies show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The products were used to form bioactive compounds, pyrazolidinones and &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides.







Abstract
Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Their asymmetric synthesis is thus widely studied. Still, a generally highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to nitroolefins providing products with adjacent stereocenters is elusive. In this article, a new polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst is presented which enables this reaction type with high stereocontrol. DFT studies revealed that the triazolium stabilizes the transition state by hydrogen bonding between C(5)&#8722;H and the nitroolefin and verify a cooperative mode of activation. Moreover, they show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage/pore structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, by which stereocontrol is achieved. Control catalyst systems confirm the crucial role of the triazolium, aryloxide and CuII, requiring a sophisticated structural orchestration for high efficiency. The addition products were used to form pyrazolidinones by chemoselective C=N reduction. These heterocycles are shown to be valuable precursors toward &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides by chemoselective nitro and N&#8722;N bond reductions. Morphological profiling using the Cell painting assay identified biological activities for the pyrazolidinones and suggest modulation of DNA synthesis as a potential mode of action. One product showed biological similarity to Camptothecin, a lead structure for cancer therapy.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxidation of Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites as the most promising absorber materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved the record efficiency of over 14%. Although suppressing the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is a frequently concerned topic for Sn&#8208;based PSCs, many studies have given vague explanations and the mechanisms are still under debate. This is in principal due to the lack of the in&#8208;depth understanding of various and complex intrinsic and extrinsic factors causing the oxidation process. In this context, we critically review the chemical mechanism of facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and differentiate its detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level. More importantly, we classify and introduce the intrinsic factors (raw materials and solvent of perovskite precursors) and extrinsic factors (exposure to neutral oxygen and superoxide) causing the oxidation with their corresponding anti&#8208;oxidation improvement methods. The presented comprehensive understanding and prospect of the oxidation provide insightful guidance for suppressing the oxidation in Sn&#8208;based PSCs &#8220;from the beginning to the end&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Semiconducting Polymers Based on Simple Electron&#8208;Deficient Cyanated trans&#8208;1, 3&#8208;Butadienes for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance but low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers remains a significant challenge in the commercialization of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). To achieve this objective, it is essential to design the key electron&#8208;deficient units with simple molecular structure and facile preparation process, which can directly facilitate the production of low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers. Herein, by sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene &#960;&#8208;skeleton, we developed a series of structurally simple but highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNDE), 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNFDE), and 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNDFDE), featuring highly coplanar backbone and deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (&#8208;3.03&#8208;4.33 eV), which render them highly attractive building blocks for developing n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. Notably, all these electron&#8208;deficient units can be easily accessed via a two&#8208;step high&#8208;yield synthetic protocol from low&#8208;cost raw materials, thus rendering them highly promising candidates for commercial applications. Upon polymerized with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units, three copolymers are developed and demonstrated unipolar n&#8208;type transport characteristics in OFETs with the highest electron mobility &gt; 1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. Hence, CNDE, CNFDE, and CNDFDE represent a class of novel, simple, and efficient electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers, providing valuable insights for the OFET applications.</dc:description>

Upon polymerized with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units, three copolymers are developed and demonstrated unipolar n-type transport characteristics in OFETs with the highest electron mobility &amp;gt; 1 cm2 V-1 s-1. Hence, CNDE, CNFDE, and CNDFDE represent a class of novel, simple, and efficient electron-deficient units for constructing low-cost n-type polymers, providing valuable insights for the OFET applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fragment Screening and Fast Micromolar Detection on a Benchtop NMR Spectrometer Boosted by Photoinduced Hyperpolarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fragment&#8208;based drug design is a well&#8208;established strategy for rational drug design, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on high&#8208;field spectrometers as the method of reference for screening and hit validation. However, high&#8208;field NMR spectrometers are not only expensive, but require specialized maintenance, dedicated space, and depend on liquid helium cooling which became critical over the recurring global helium shortages. We propose an alternative to high&#8208;field NMR screening by applying the recently developed approach of fragment screening by photoinduced hyperpolarized NMR on a cryogen&#8208;free 80 MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer yielding signal enhancements of up to three orders in magnitude. It is demonstrated that it is possible to discover new hits and kick&#8208;off drug design using a benchtop NMR spectrometer at low micromolar concentrations of both protein and ligand. The approach presented performs at higher speed than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;field NMR approaches while exhibiting a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Photoinduced hyperpolarization is known to be inexpensive and simple to be implemented, which aligns greatly with the philosophy of benchtop NMR spectrometers. These findings open the way for the use of benchtop NMR in near&#8208;physiological conditions for drug design and further life science applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(Ethylene Piperidinium)s for Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) that possess both high hydroxide conductivity and stable mechanical and chemical properties poses a major challenge to the development of high&#8208;performance fuel cells. Improving one side of the balance between conductivity and stability usually means sacrificing the other. Herein, we used facile, high&#8208;yield chemical reactions to design and synthesize a piperidinium polymer with a polyethylene backbone for AEM fuel cell applications. To improve the performance, we introduced ionic crosslinking into high&#8208;cationic&#8208;ratio AEMs to suppress high water uptake and swelling while further improving the hydroxide conductivity. Remarkably, PEP80&#8208;20PS achieved a hydroxide conductivity of 354.3 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C while remaining mechanically stable. Compared with the base polymer PEP80, the water uptake of PEP80&#8208;20PS decreased by 69% from 813% to 350%, and the swelling decreased substantially by 85% from 350.0% to 50.2% at 80 &#176;C. PEP80&#8208;20PS also showed excellent alkaline stability, 84.7% remained after 35 days of treatment with an aqueous KOH solution. The chemical design in this study represents a significant advancement toward the development of simultaneously highly stable and conductive AEMs for fuel cell applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Generation Through Singlet Fission in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: An Alternative Route to Inefficient Singlet&#8208;Triplet Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High quantum yield triplets, populated by initially prepared excited singlets, are desired for various energy conversion schemes in solid working compositions like porous MOFs. However, a large disparity in the distribution of the excitonic center of mass, singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) in such assemblies is inhibited, so much so that a carboxy&#8208;coordinated zirconium heavy metal ion cannot effectively facilitate the ISC through spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Circumventing this sluggish ISC, singlet fission (SF) is explored as a viable route to generating triplets in solution&#8208;stable MOFs. Efficient SF is achieved through a high degree of interchromophoric coupling that facilitates electron super&#8208;exchange to generate triplet pairs. Here we show that a predesigned chromophoric linker with extremely poor ISC efficiency (kISC) but  &#160;form triplets in MOF in contrast to the frameworks that are built from linkers with sizable kISC but . This work opens a new photophysical and photochemical avenue in MOF chemistry and utility in energy conversion schemes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides by Using Ball Milling and a Piezoelectric Material as the Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8208;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine &#160;and a terminal reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polymethacrylates made by ATRP and RAFT Polymerization: High&#8208;Yielding Depolymerization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although controlled radical polymerization is an excellent tool to make precision polymeric materials, reversal of the process to retrieve the starting monomer is far less explored despite the significance of chemical recycling. Here, we investigate the bulk depolymerization of RAFT and ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers under identical conditions. RAFT&#8208;synthesized polymers undergo a relatively low&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free depolymerization back to monomer thanks to the partial in&#8208;situ transformation of the RAFT end&#8208;group to macromonomer. Instead, ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers can only depolymerize at significantly higher temperatures (&gt;350 &#730;C) through random backbone scission. To aid a more complete depolymerization at even lower temperatures, we performed a facile and quantitative end&#8208;group modification strategy in which both ATRP and RAFT end&#8208;groups were successfully converted to macromonomers. The macromonomers triggered a lower temperature bulk depolymerization with an onset at 150 &#730;C yielding up to 90% of monomer regeneration. The versatility of the methodology was demonstrated by a scalable depolymerization (~10 g of starting polymer) retrieving 84% of the starting monomer intact which could be subsequently used for further polymerization. This work presents a new low&#8208;energy approach for depolymerizing controlled radical polymers and creates many future opportunities as high&#8208;yielding, solvent&#8208;free and scalable depolymerization methods are sought.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Reactivity of Borocarbonitride in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borocarbonitride (BCN) materials are newly developed oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes. However, BCN materials tend to form bulky B2O3 due to over&#8208;oxidation at the high reaction temperature, resulting in significant deactivation. Here, we report a series of super stable BCN nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance of the BCN nanosheets can be easily regulated by changing the guanine dosage. The control experiment and structural characterization indicate that the introduction of a suitable amount of carbon could prevent the formation of excessive B2O3 from BCN materials and maintain the 2D skeleton at a high temperature of 520 oC. The best&#8208;performing catalyst BCN exhibits 81.9% selectivity towards olefins with a stable propane conversion of 35.8%, and the propene productivity reaches 16.2 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, much better than commercial BN catalysts. Density functional theory calculation results show&#160;that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can significantly affect the electronic microenvironment of hexagonal BN (h&#8208;BN), thereby boosting the catalytic activity of BCN.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Interactions on Platinum/(Metal&#8208;Oxide)&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Boost Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By supporting platinum (Pt) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles on indium oxide (In2O3), we fabricate a CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst. Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) is achieved on CdS/Pt/In2O3 having electronic Pt&#8208;In2O3 interactions, with CH4 selectivity reaching to 100%, which is higher than that on CdS/Pt/In2O3 without electronic Pt&#8208;In2O3 interactions (71.7%). Moreover, enhancement effect of electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions on selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 also occurs by using other common metal oxides as photocatalyst supports, including titanium oxide, gallium oxide, zinc oxide and tungsten oxide. The electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions separate photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and convert CO2 into CO2&#948;&#8208; which can be easily hydrogenated into CH4 via a CO2&#948;&#8208; &#8594; HCOO* &#8594; HCO* &#8594; CH* &#8594; CH4 path, thus boosting selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. This offers a new way to achieve selective photoreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Modulation Enhances Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Deep Cycling of Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable Zn anodes with a high utilization efficiency pose a challenge due to notorious dendrite growth and severe side reactions. Therefore, electrolyte additives are developed to address these issues. However, the additives are always consumed by the electrochemical reactions over cycling, affecting the cycling stability. Here, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is reported as an electrolyte additive for achieving stable cycling of Zn anodes. HMPA reshapes the solvation structures and promotes anion decomposition, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. More interestingly, this anion decomposition does not involve HMPA, preserving its long&#8208;term impact on the electrolyte. Thus, the symmetric cells with HMPA in the electrolyte survive ~500 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8208;2 or ~200 h at 40 mA cm&#8208;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8208;2 with a Zn utilization rate of 85.6%. The full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio = 12 &#956;L mAh&#8208;1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio = 1.8) and a high areal capacity (6.6 mAh cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Diboriranide &#963;&#8208;complexes of d&#8208; and p&#8208;block metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diboriranides are the smallest conceivable monoanionic aromatic cycles, yet only limited examples have been reported and their reactivity and complexation behavior remain completely unexplored. We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; as its lithium salt via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane from a readily available 1,2&#8208;dichlorodiborane(4) (Dur = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl). With the preparation and complete characterization of representative complexes with tin, copper, gold and zinc, we demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring&#8217;s 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Controlled CdS/Ti3C2 MXene Schottky Junction for Highly Selective and Active Photocatalytic Dehydrogenation&#8208;Reductive Amination&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic valorization and selective transformation of biomass&#8208;derived platform compounds offer great opportunities for efficient utilization of renewable resources under mild conditions. Here, the novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction (MCdS) composed of surface&#8208;controlled CdS and pretreated Ti3C2 MXene is created for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived amino acid production under ambient temperature with unprecedented activity and selectivity. Schottky junction efficiently promotes photoexcited charge migration and separation and inhibits photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination, which results in a super&#8208;high activity. Meanwhile, CdS with the reduced surface energy supplies sufficient hydrogen sources for imine reduction and induces the preferential orientation of alanine, thus contributing superior selectivity. Moreover, a wide range of hydroxyl acids are successfully converted into corresponding amino acids and even one&#8208;pot conversion of glucose to alanine is easily achieved over MCdS. This work illustrates the mechanism of crystal orientation control and heterojunction construction in controlling catalytic behavior of photocatalytic nanoreactor, providing a paradigm for construction of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Bromination, Chlorination and Thiocyanation Using Inorganic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative halogenations of alkyl carboxylic acids are highly valuable reactions for the synthesis of stucturally diverse alkyl halides. However, many reported protocols rely on stoichiometric strong oxidants or highly electrophilic halogenating agents. Herein, we describe visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative halogenations of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide&#8208;activated carboxylic acids that avoid stiochiometric oxidants and use inexpensive inorganic halide salts as the halogenating agents. Brominations with lithium bromide proceed under simple, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using an organic photoredox catalyst and no other additives, whereas dual photoredox&#8211;copper&#8208;catalysis is required for chlorinations with lithium chloride. The mild conditions display excellent functional group tolerance, which is demonstrated through the transformation of a diverse range of structurally complex carboxylic acid&#8208;containing natural products into the corresponding alkyl bromides and chlorides. In addition, we show the generality of the dual photoredox&#8211;copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalizations with inorganic salts by extension to a thiocyanation with potasium thiocyanide, which was applied to the synthesis of complex alkyl thiocyanates.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8216;material of choice&#8217; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three&#8208;dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208;oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrolytically degradable block copolymer nanoparticles are prepared via reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in aqueous media. This efficient one&#8208;pot protocol involves the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMAC) using a monofunctional or bifunctional trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) precursor. DMAC monomer is employed as a co&#8208;solvent to solubilize the hydrophobic PCL chains. At an intermediate DMAC conversion of 20&#8208;60%, the homogeneous reaction mixture is diluted with water to 10&#8208;25% w/w solids. The growing amphiphilic block copolymer chains undergo nucleation to form sterically&#8208;stabilized PCL&#8208;core nanoparticles with PDMAC coronas. 1H NMR studies confirm &gt;99% DMAC conversion while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) studies indicate well&#8208;controlled RAFT polymerizations (Mw/Mn &#8804; 1.30). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicate spheres of 20&#8208;120 nm diameter. As expected, hydrolytic degradation occurs within days at 37 &#186;C in either acidic or alkaline solution. Degradation is also observed in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 37 &#186;C. However, no degradation can be detected over a three&#8208;month period when these nanoparticles are stored at 20 &#186;C in deionized water (pH 6.7).

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electrolysis to Formic Acid over a Wide Potential Window: An Electrocatalyst Comprised of Indium Nanoparticles on Chitosan&#8208;Derived Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium nanoparticles on chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) create bifunctional active centers that integrate chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for CO2 electrolysis. The electrocatalyst demonstrated outstanding performance for the CO2 reduction reaction with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward HCOOH across a wide potential window and with high current density.







Abstract
Realizing industrial&#8208;scale production of HCOOH from the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is very important, but the current density as well as the electrochemical potential window are still limited to date. Herein, we achieved this by integration of chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for the CO2RR via anchoring In nanoparticles (NPs) on biomass&#8208;derived substrates to create In/X&#8722;C (X=N, P, B) bifunctional active centers. The In NPs/chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) catalyst had outstanding performance for the CO2RR with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH across a wide potential window. Particularly, at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, the FE of HCOOH was as high as 96.0&#8201;%, and the reduction potential was as low as &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs RHE. When using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), a pure HCOOH solution could be obtained at the cathode without further separation and purification. The FE of HCOOH was still up to 93.3&#8201;% at 0.52&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the HCOOH production rate could reach 9.051&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our results suggested that the defects and multilayer structure in In/N&#8208;dG could not only enhance CO2 chemical adsorption capability, but also trigger the formation of an electron&#8208;rich catalytic environment around In sites to promote the generation of HCOOH.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;cis Disubstituted Cycloalkanes by Convergent NiH Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiH&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) of easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixture of cycloalkenes and a NiH&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization transformation of prochiral cyclic alkenes are reported. This migratory hydroalkylation process produces enantioenriched thermodynamically disfavored 1,2&#8208;cis cycloalkanes with excellent levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enantioenriched multi&#8208;substituted cycloalkanes constitute an essential class of compounds in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Here we report an NiH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric migratory hydroalkylation process for the efficient and selective construction of such compounds. Through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT), easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixtures of cycloalkenes could be directly utilized as starting materials, convergently producing thermo&#8208;dynamically disfavored chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes bearing vicinal stereocenters with high levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In addition, prochiral cyclic alkenes can be also employed, and deliver chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes through desymmetrization process.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed&#8208;loop recycling of vinylogous urethane vitrimers made from acetoacetate&#8208;terminated polyethyleneglycol and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine is presented. Treatment with water allows the selective and quantitative recovery of the monomers, even from mixed waste streams. The modular synthetic approach allows the synthesis of materials that cover a broad range of mechanical properties and that are easy to reprocess.







Abstract
Devising energy&#8208;efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis&#8208;polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (&#8776;98&#8201;%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG&#8208;based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed&#8208;loop recycling characteristics.

Novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step approach for the synthesis of polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) by incorporating nanogels into microgels via droplet&#8208;based microfluidics yielding different internal morphologies including phase&#8208;separated coacervates, statistically distributed coacervates and core&#8211;shell like arrangements by variation of synthesis parameters such as nanogel concentration, ionic strength and pH value.







Abstract
In pH&#8208;responsive drug carriers, the distribution of charges has been proven to affect delivery efficiency but is difficult to control and verify. Herein, we fabricate polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) and show that the arrangement of the nanogels (NG) can easily be manipulated by adapting synthesis conditions. Positively and negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive NG are synthesized by precipitation polymerization and labelled with different fluorescent dyes. The obtained NG are integrated into microgel (MG) networks by subsequent inverse emulsion polymerization in droplet&#8208;based microfluidics. By confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we verify that depending on NG concentration, pH value and ionic strength, NiM&#8722;C with different NG arrangements are obtained, including Janus&#8208;like phase&#8208;separation of NG, statistical distribution of NG, and core&#8211;shell arrangements. Our approach is a major step towards uptake and release of oppositely charged (drug) molecules.

         <title>In situ Generated Iridium Nanoparticles as Hydride Donors in Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions with Deuterium and Tritium Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the synergistic approach of in situ generated iridium nanoparticles in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization hydrogen isotope exchange with deuterium and tritium gas.







Abstract
We have studied the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reaction with deuterium or tritium gas as isotope sources and in situ formed transition metal nanoparticles as hydrogen atom transfer pre&#8208;catalysts. By this means we have found synergistic reactivities applying two different HIE mechanisms, namely photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization HIE leading to the synthesis of highly deuterated complex molecules. Finally, we adopted these findings successfully to tritium chemistry.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a Bond&#8208;Localized C2h Structure and a Challenge for Computational Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a computational challenge. Highly correlated methods and popular DFT functionals predict a bond&#8208;delocalized D2h symmetry, but excellent agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts suggests a true C2h geometry.







Abstract
Whether tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a symmetric D2h structure or a bond&#8208;alternating C2h structure remains a standing puzzle. Close agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts based on minima structures optimized at the M06&#8208;2X, &#969;B97X&#8208;D, and M11 levels confirm a bond&#8208;localized C2h symmetry, which is consistent with the expected strong antiaromaticity of TtB&#8208;s&#8208;indacene.

         <title>Polymerization Induced Microphase Separation for the Fabrication of Nanostructured Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) uses the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers during bulk polymerization to create nanostructured materials with highly tunable domain sizes and morphologies, including highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PIMS chemistry, and explores the wide variety of materials and applications accessible by the PIMS technique.







Abstract
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed with at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nanostructured materials with the highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11&#8197;years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence&#8208;based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.

         <title>Protein&#8208;based Nanoparticles: From Drug Delivery to Imaging, Nanocatalysis and Protein Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, significant progress was made in the development of protein nanoparticles, transitioning from artificial assemblies for drug delivery, to multifunctional systems for nanocatalysis and protein therapy. Advanced biohybrid materials, combined with dynamic chemistries and mild methods of particle formation produce nanoparticles that take advantage of the catalytic activity or targeting capabilities of the underlying proteins and enzymes.







Abstract
Proteins and enzymes are versatile biomaterials for a wide range of medical applications due to their high specificity for receptors and substrates, high degradability, low toxicity, and overall good biocompatibility. Protein nanoparticles are formed by the arrangement of several native or modified proteins into nanometer&#8208;sized assemblies. In this review, we will focus on artificial nanoparticle systems, where proteins are the main structural element and not just an encapsulated payload. While under natural conditions, only certain proteins form defined aggregates and nanoparticles, chemical modifications or a change in the physical environment can further extend the pool of available building blocks. This allows the assembly of many globular proteins and even enzymes. These advances in preparation methods led to the emergence of new generations of nanosystems that extend beyond transport vehicles to diverse applications, from multifunctional drug delivery to imaging, nanocatalysis and protein therapy.

         <title>Acidic Media Impedes Tandem Catalysis Reaction Pathways in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis effects in electrochemical CO2 reduction were investigated through an isotopic labelling strategy involving the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures. The results provide evidence that tandem catalysis does indeed occur in neutral electrolyte but is curtailed under acidic conditions. This is due to Cu becoming less effective at utilizing tandem&#8208;supplied CO in the presence of hydronium ions.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) in acidic media with Cu&#8208;based catalysts tends to suffer from lowered selectivity towards multicarbon products. This could in principle be mitigated using tandem catalysis, whereby the *CO coverage on Cu is increased by introducing a CO generating catalyst (e.g. Ag) in close proximity. Although this has seen significant success in neutral/alkaline media, here we report that such a strategy becomes impeded in acidic electrolyte. This was investigated through the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures using a series of Cu and CuAg catalysts. These experiments provide strong evidence for the occurrence of tandem catalysis in neutral media and its curtailment under acidic conditions. Density functional theory simulations suggest that the presence of H3O+ weakens the *CO binding energy of Cu, preventing effective utilization of tandem&#8208;supplied CO. Our findings also provide other unanticipated insights into the tandem catalysis reaction pathway and important design considerations for effective CO2R in acidic media.

         <title>MET&#8208;Activating Ubiquitin Multimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric small protein ligands, referred to as U&#8208;body constructs, were developed from ubiquitin and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via genetic implantation (lasso&#8208;grafting) and spacer optimization, showing antagonist or &#8220;enhancer&#8221; activity for a receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Subsequently, multimeric U&#8208;body&#8208;based proteins, U&#8208;bodies, were constructed, exhibiting potent agonist activity for MET.







Abstract
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U&#8208;bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET and are derived from MET&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U&#8208;body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso&#8208;grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U&#8208;body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability.

     alt="MET-Activating Ubiquitin Multimers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monomeric small protein ligands, referred to as U-body constructs, were developed from ubiquitin and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via genetic implantation (lasso-grafting) and spacer optimization, showing antagonist or &#8220;enhancer&#8221; activity for a receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Subsequently, multimeric U-body-based proteins, U-bodies, were constructed, exhibiting potent agonist activity for MET.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)-based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U-bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET and are derived from MET-binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U-body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso-grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U-body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U-body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF-induced MET-phosphorylation. Their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U-bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation-promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso-grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein-based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Type&#8208;II Red Phosphorus: Wavy Packing of Twisted Pentagonal Tubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of type&#8208;II red phosphorus is investigated by various structural characterizations, including 3D electron diffraction, atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. A triclinic unit cell with a large volume containing around 250 phosphorus atoms is identified via 3D electron diffraction. The twisted wavy tubular motif, a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, is also revealed via STEM.







Abstract
Elemental phosphorus exhibits fascinating structural varieties and versatile properties. The unique nature of phosphorus bonds can lead to the formation of extremely complex structures, and detailed structural information on some phosphorus polymorphs is yet to be investigated. In this study, we investigated an unidentified crystalline phase of phosphorus, type&#8208;II red phosphorus (RP), by combining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural characterization techniques. Electron diffraction tomography, atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were concurrently used to elucidate the hidden structural motifs and their packing in type&#8208;II RP. Electron diffraction tomography, performed using individual crystalline nanowires, was used to identify a triclinic unit cell with volume of 5330&#8197;&#197;3, which is the largest unit cell for elemental phosphorus crystals up to now and contains approximately 250 phosphorus atoms. Atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, which was performed along different crystal&#8208;zone axes, confirmed that the twisted wavy tubular motif is the basic building block of type&#8208;II RP. Our study discovered and presented a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, and it provides insights to clarify the complexities observed in phosphorus as well as other relevant systems.

         <title>Autohydrolysis of Diglycine&#8208;Activated Succinic Esters Boosts Cellular Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxy&#8208;terminal diglycine&#8208;modified succinate compounds undergo autohydrolysis at physiological pH. This process converts supramolecular assemblies from nanofibers to nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. This approach also restores drug efficacy, promoting effective intracellular therapeutics.







Abstract
Rapid cellular uptake of synthetic molecules remains a challenge, and the motif frequently employed to generate prodrugs, succinic ester, unfortunately lowers the efficacy of the desired drugs due to their slow ester hydrolysis and low cell entry. Here we show that succinic ester&#8208;containing diglycine drastically boosts the cellular uptake of supramolecular assemblies or prodrugs. Specifically, autohydrolysis of the diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters turns the nanofibers of the conjugates of succinic ester and self&#8208;assembling motif into nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. The autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters and drug conjugates also restores the efficacy of the drugs. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests that a &#8220;U&#8208;turn&#8221; of diglycine favors intramolecular hydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters to promote autohydrolysis. As an example of rapid autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters for instant cellular uptake, this work illustrates a nonenzymatic bond cleavage approach to develop effective therapeutics for intracellular targeting.

         <title>Fluorogenic and Cell&#8208;Permeable Rhodamine Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Live&#8208;Cell Protein Labeling in Bioimaging and Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the equilibrium between a nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion state (protein&#8208;bound), fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamine dyes have been developed for high&#8208;contrast protein labeling in living cells. Such new generation of probes offer exceptional performance in multi&#8208;color/lifetime imaging, superresolution microscopy, single protein tracking, and chemigenetic biosensors.







Abstract
The advancement of fluorescence microscopy techniques has opened up new opportunities for visualizing proteins and unraveling their functions in living biological systems. Small&#8208;molecule organic dyes, which possess exceptional photophysical properties, small size, and high photostability, serve as powerful fluorescent reporters in protein imaging. However, achieving high&#8208;contrast live&#8208;cell labeling of target proteins with conventional organic dyes remains a considerable challenge in bioimaging and biosensing due to their inadequate cell permeability and high background signal. Over the past decade, a novel generation of fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable dyes has been developed, which have substantially improved live&#8208;cell protein labeling by fine&#8208;tuning the reversible equilibrium between a cell&#8208;permeable, nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion (protein&#8208;bound) of rhodamines. In this review, we present the mechanism and design strategies of these fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamines, as well as their applications in bioimaging and biosensing.

Polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF)&#8208;based battery separator as an ideal lightweight barrier (ca. 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was first directly involved in the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (Li&#8722;S) system to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect through supramolecularly recognizing polysulfide guests and then catalyzing their conversion while simultaneously accelerating Li+ ions diffusion in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Developing polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF) still remains challenging due to an extremely difficult task in rationally interconnecting two dissimilar building blocks. Here we report an unprecedented POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF crystalline structure produced through the self&#8208;assembly process of a Krebs&#8208;type POM, [Zn2(WO2)2(SbW9O33)2]10&#8722;, and two &#946;&#8208;CD units. The as&#8208;prepared POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF&#8208;based battery separator can be applied as a lightweight barrier (approximately 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The designed Li&#8722;S batteries equipped with the POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF modified separator exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, attributed to fast Li+ diffusion through the supramolecular channel of &#946;&#8208;CD, efficient polysulfide&#8208;capture ability by the dynamic host&#8211;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD, and improved sulfur redox kinetics by the bidirectional catalysis of POM cluster. This research provides a broad perspective for the development of multifunctional supramolecular POM frameworks and their applications in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <dc:description>Stability issues could refrain from commercializing lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) despite having comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long&#8208;term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets (Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7% in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) PSCs. Devices retain 93.8% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Access to a Bowl&#8208;Type Macrocycle and a Barrel&#8208;Type Heptanuclear Complex Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) is a powerful and widely applied tool in modern synthetic chemistry, which is based on the reversible cleavage and formation of covalent bonds. One of the inherent strengths of this approach is the perspective to reversibly generate novel structural motifs in an operationally simple approach, which are difficult or impossible to access with more traditional methods and require multiple bond cleaving and bond forming steps. To date, these fundamentally important synthetic and conceptual challenges in the context of DCvC have predominantly been tackled by exploiting compounds of lighter p&#8208;block elements, albeit heavier p&#8208;block elements show low bond dissociation energies and appear to be ideally suited for this approach. Here we show that a dinuclear organometallic bismuth compound, containing BiMe2 groups that are connected by a thioxanthene linker, readily undergoes selective and reversible cleavage of its Bi&#8211;C bonds upon exposure to external stimuli. The exploitation of DCvC in the field of organometallic heavy p&#8208;block chemistry grants access to unprecedented macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type oligonuclear compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real&#8208;time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative in situ technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non&#8208;invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light&#8208;driven catalysts enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Metallic Superionic Layers Suppressing Voltage Fading of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Towards Superior&#8208;Stable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs) with greater specific capacity density are constrained by voltage attenuation and inferior rate performance because of irreversible oxygen release, metal dissolving and poor lithium&#8208;ion transport capacity. Herein, a simple surface modification is designed to solve the performance degradation and structural collapse of LRLOs. Combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO) with spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, is introduced to the surface of the cathode restrains the activated surficial lattice oxygen ions by its stable oxygen vacancies. Additionally, Ni doping results in a fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 structure (LNO) with lowered lithium ions diffusion barrier, which is tightly conjugating to substrate and synergistically reinforces the Li diffusion path through the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Moreover, Mn dissolution is successfully relieved due to the decrease in Mn concentration in the coating layers. As a result, the modified material (LRLO@LMO@LNO) exhibits an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 120.4 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 10 C with a very small discharge voltage attenuation of 313 mV after 600 cycles (0.52 mV per cycle) at 1 C. Undoubtedly, this method discloses a simple and effective approach to promote the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density.</dc:description>

         <title>Alignment and Dynamic Inversion of Planar Chirality in Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pillar[n]arenes are symmetrical macrocyclic compounds composed of benzene panels with para&#8208;methylene linkages. Each panel usually exhibits planar chirality and prefers chirality&#8208;aligned states. Because of this feature, pillar[n]arenes are attractive scaffolds for chiroptical materials that are easy to prepare and optically resolve and show intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. In addition, rotation of the panels endows the chirality of pillar[n]arenes with a dynamic nature. The chirality in tubular oligomers and supramolecular assemblies sometimes show time&#8208; and procedure&#8208;dependent alignment phenomena. Furthermore, the CD signals of some pillar[n]arenes respond to the addition of chiral guests when their dynamic chirality is coupled with host&#8211;guest properties. By using diastereomeric pillar[n]arenes with additional chiral structures, the response can also be caused by achiral guests and changes of the environment, providing molecular sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Generation of Cyanocarbenes from Alkynyl Triazenes for the Synthesis of Nitrile Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists and especially acid&#8208;induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern involving the cleavage of the N1&#8208;N2 bond of the triazene moiety resulting in a unique approach to cyanocarbenes from a readily available, stable, and insensitive precursor. This allows to access various nitrile compounds without the use of a toxic cyanating agent by exploiting the reactivity pattern of carbenes. By variation of the reaction conditions and light sources, different substitution patterns can be obtained selectively in good yields under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions, thus introducing the alkynyl triazene unit as a photo accessible methylene nitrile synthon. Using this synthon, subclasses like &#945;&#8208;alkoxynitriles, &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrazones become easily available. These exhibit synthetically valuable substitution patterns for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, intermediates for total synthesis and amino acid synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on the Development of Pouch&#8208;Type Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; in the energy storage field due to their high energy density (theoretically &gt;500 Wh kg&#8208;1). Recently, tremendous efforts have been made to promote the research &amp; development (R&amp;D) of pouch&#8208;type LMBs toward practical application. This article aims to provide a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth review of recent progress on pouch&#8208;type LMBs from full cell aspect, and to offer insights to guide its future development. It will review pouch&#8208;type LMBs using both liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and cover topics related to both Li and cathode (including LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2, S and O2) as both electrodes impact the battery performance. The key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs and their relationship in between are introduced first, then the major challenges facing the development of pouch&#8208;type LMBs are discussed in detail, especially those severely aggravated in pouch cells compared with coin cells. Subsequently, the recent progress on mechanistic understandings of the degradation of pouch&#8208;type LMBs is summarized, followed with the practical strategies that have been utilized to address these issues and to improve the key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs. In the end, it provides perspectives on advancing the R&amp;Ds of pouch&#8208;type LMBs towards their application in practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Titanium and Chromium Catalysis in a Reaction Network for the Reprogramming of [BH4]&#8208; as Electron Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reagent for Radical Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We describe a unique catalytic system with an efficient coupling of Ti&#8208; and Cr&#8208;catalyst in a reaction network that allows the use of [BH4]&#8208; as stoichiometric hydrogen atom and electron donor in catalytic radical chemistry. The key feature is a relay hydrogen atom transfer from [BH4]&#8208; to Cr generating the active catalysts under mild conditions. This enables epoxide reductions, regiodivergent epoxide opening and radical cyclizations that are not possible with cooperative catalysis with radicals or by epoxide reductions via Meinwald rearrangement and ensuing carbonyl reduction. No typical SN2&#8208;type reactivity of [BH4]&#8208; salts is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective activation of strong C&#8211;Cl bond for highly selective photosynthesis of bibenzyl via homo&#8208;coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;carbon&#160;coupling of organic halides as an important process in organic synthesis has been successfully achieved in homogeneous catalysis, while the dependence on rare noble metals, complicated metal&#8208;complex and poor catalyst stability and recyclability, need&#160;to be tackled. The past few years have witnessed heterogeneous photocatalysis as&#160;green and novel methods for organic synthesis processes. However, the study on C&#8211;C coupling of chloride substrates is very limited due to the extremely high bond energy of C&#8211;Cl bond (327 kJ mol&#8208;1). Here, we report a robust heterogeneous photocatalyst (Cu/ZnO) to drive the homo&#8208;coupling of benzyl chloride with high efficiency, which achieves an unprecedented high selectivity of bibenzyl (93%) and yield rate of 92% at room temperature. Moreover, this photocatalytic process can be applied to 10 benzyl chlorides with high yields. With detailed characterisation (XPS, EPR, TPD) and DFT calculation, the high selectivity is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of reactants, stabilisation of intermediates (benzyl radicals) for the selective coupling by the Cu loading and the moderate oxidation ability of ZnO support, besides the promoted charge separation and transfer by Cu species. Therefore, this work offers a new route to highly selective synthesise bibenzyl from chloride substrates by a stable heterogeneous system.</dc:description>

         <title>NH4+ Charge Carrier Coordinated H&#8208;Bonded Organic Small Molecule for Fast and Superstable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small molecules as high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Zn&#8722;organic batteries have inspired numerous interests, but are trapped by their easy&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes. Here we knit ultrastable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks between 2, 7&#8208;dinitropyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (DNPT) and NH4+ charge carrier. DNPT with octuple&#8208;active carbonyl/nitro centers (H&#8208;bond acceptor) are redox&#8208;exclusively accessible for flexible tetrahedral NH4+ ions (H&#8208;bond donator) but exclude larger and rigid Zn2+, due to a lower activation energy (0.14 vs. 0.31 eV). NH4+ coordinated H&#8208;bonding chemistry conquers the stability barrier of DNPT in electrolyte, and gives fast diffusion kinetics of non&#8208;metallic charge carrier. A stable two&#8208;step 4e&#8722; NH4+ coordination with DNPT cathode harvests a high capacity (320 mAh g&#8722;1), a high&#8208;rate capability (50 A g&#8722;1) and an ultralong life (60,000 cycles). This finding points to a new paradigm for H&#8208;bond stabilized organic small molecules to design advanced zinc batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry Reveals Kinetics Information of Metal&#8208;Ion Battery Materials with Multiple Redox Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue (PB) has emerged as a promising cathode material in aqueous batteries. It possesses two distinct redox centers, and the potassium ions (K+) are unevenly distributed throughout the compound, adding complexity to the interpretation of the K+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion kinetic mechanism. Traditional ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements are limited in uncovering the precise kinetic information of the PB particles, as the results are influenced by the construction of the porous composite electrode and the redox behavior from different particles. In this study, the electrochemical processes of individual PB particles were investigated using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. By varying the potentials, different types of transient current signals were obtained that revealed the kinetic mechanism of each oxidation/reduction reaction in combination with theoretical simulation. Additionally, a partially contradictory conclusion between single&#8208;particle analysis and the ensemble&#8208;averaged measurement was discussed. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the electrochemical processes of cathode materials with multiple redox centers, which facilitates the development of effective strategies to optimize these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Cation Solvation Structure for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balancing the activation of H2O is crucial for highly selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), as the protonation steps of CO2RR require fast H2O dissociation kinetics, while suppressing hydrogen evolution (HER) demands slow H2O reduction. We herein proposed one molecular engineering strategy to regulate the H2O activation using aprotic organic small molecules with high Gutmann donor number as a solvation shell regulator. These organic molecules occupy the first solvation shell of K+ and accumulates in the electrical double layer, decreasing the H2O density at the interface and the relative content of proton suppliers (free and coordinated H2O), suppressing the HER. The adsorbed H2O was stabilized via second sphere effect and its dissociation was promoted by weakening the O&#8208;H bond, which accelerates the subsequent *CO2 protonation kinetics and reduces the energy barrier from 0.93 to 0.42 eV. In the model electrolyte containing 5 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive (KCl&#8208;DMSO&#8208;5), the highest CO selectivity over Ag foil increased to 99.2%, with FECO higher than 90.0% within &#8208;0.75 to &#8208;1.15 V (vs. RHE). This molecular engineering strategy for cation solvation shell can be extended to other metal electrodes, such as Zn and Sn, and organic molecule like N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Tribochemically Controlled Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Enabled by Contact Electrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional mechanochemically controlled reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) utilizes ultrasound or ball milling to regenerate activators, which induce the side reactions because of the high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency stimuli. Here, we proposed a facile approach for tribochemically controlled ATRP (tribo&#8208;ATRP), relying on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis between titanium oxide (TiO2) particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethylamine (TPMA), without any high&#8208;energy input. Under the friction induced by stirring, the titanium oxide particles were electrified, continuously reducing CuBr2/TPMA into CuBr/TPMA, thereby conversing alkyl halides into active radicals to start ATRP. In addition, the effect of friction on the reaction was elucidated by the theoretical simulation. The results indicated that elevated frequency could reduce the energy barrier for the electron transfer from titanium oxide (TiO2) particles to CuBr2/TPMA. In this study, the design of tribo&#8208;ATRP was successfully achieved, enabling a contact&#8208;electrification&#8208;catalysis (~ 10 Hz) access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Carbanionic Synthesis of Fully Bio&#8208;Based Triblock Structures Derived from &#946;&#8208;Farnesene and ll&#8208;Dilactide: Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current environmental challenges and the shrinking fossil&#8208;fuel feedstock are important criteria for the next generation of polymer materials. In this context, we present a fully bio&#8208;based material, which shows promise as thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Due to the use of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and L&#8208;lactide as monomers, bio&#8208;based feedstocks, namely sugar cane and corn can be used. A bifunctional initiator for the carbanionic polymerization was employed, to permit an efficient synthesis of ABA&#8208;type block structures. In addition, the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent MTBE (methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether) was used. This afforded low dispersity (&#272; = 1.07 to 1.10) and telechelic polyfarnesene macro&#173;initiators. These were employed for lactide polymerization to obtain H&#8208;shaped triblock copolymers. TEM and SAXS revealed clearly phase&#8208;separated morphologies and tensile tests revealed elastic mechanical properties. The materials featured two glass transition temperatures, at &#8208; 66 &#176;C and 51 &#176;C as well as gyroid or cylindrical morphologies, resulting in soft elastic materials at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Dearomatization of Phenols via Ligand&#8208;Enabled Cooperative Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By employing a chiral bifunctional phosphine ligand, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed efficient and highly enantioselective dearomatization of phenols is achieved via versatile metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. The reaction is proven to be remarkably general in scope, permitting substitutions at all four remaining benzene positions, accommodating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups including strongly deactivating nitro, and allowing carbon&#8208;based groups of varying steric bulk including t&#8208;butyl at the alkyne terminus. Moreover, besides N&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)alkynylamides, the corresponding ynoates and ynones are all suitable substrates. Spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones, spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;butenolides, and spirocyclohexadenone&#8208;cyclopentenones are formed in yields up to 99% and with ee up to 99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene Formation or Reduction of the Diazo Functional Group? An Unexpected Solvent&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Cyclic Diazo Imides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of the reactivity of diazo compounds is commonly achieved by the choice of a suitable catalyst, e.g. via stabilization of singlet carbenes or radical intermediates. Herein, we report on the light&#8208;promoted reactivity of cyclic diazo imides with thiols, where the choice of solvent results in two fundamentally different reaction pathways. In dichloromethane (DCM), a carbene is formed initially and engages in a cascade C&#8208;H functionalization/thiolation reaction to deliver indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidines in good to excellent yields. When switching to acetonitrile solvent, the carbene pathway is shut down and an unusual reduction of the diazo compound occurs under otherwise identical reaction conditions, where the aryl thiol acts as reductant. A combined set of experimental and computational studies was carried out to obtain mechanistic understanding and to support that indane formation proceeds via the insertion of a triplet carbene, while the reduction of diazo imides proceeds via an electron transfer process.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked [2]Rotaxane Aerogels with Tunable Morphologies and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanical bonds have been utilized as promising motifs to construct mechanically interlocked aerogels (MIAs) with mechanical adaptivity and multifunctionality. However, fabricating such aerogels with not only precise chemical structures but also dynamic features remains challenging. Herein, we present MIAs carrying dense [2]rotaxane units, thereby enabling both the stability and flexibility of the aerogel network. Owing to the stable chemical structure of [2]rotaxane, MIAs possessing precise and full&#8208;scale mechanically interlocked network could be fabricated with the aid of diverse solvents. In addition, the dynamic nature of [2]rotaxane resulted in morphologies and mechanical performances of MIAs that can be dramatically modulated under chemical stimuli. We hope that the structure&#8208;property relationship in MIAs will facilitate the development of mechanically interlocked materials and provide novel opportunities toward constructing smart materials with multifunctionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Endocyclic 1&#8208;Azaallyl Anions: Concise Synthesis of Unprotected Enantioenriched cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;Diarylpiperidines</title>

         <dc:description>
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized from readily available piperidines in only three operations. The key step is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and endocyclic 1&#8208;azallyl anions, elusive intermediates derived from the in situ deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction can be achieved enantioselectively with a chiral mono&#8208;phosphine ligand.







Abstract
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized through an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and elusive endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions. These intermediates are generated in situ by the deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines, precursors that are readily prepared in two operations from simple piperidines. An asymmetric version of this reaction with (2R, 3R)&#8208;iPr&#8208;BI&#8208;DIME as the ligand provides products in moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of endocyclic 1&#8208;azaallyl anions.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Platinum Hybrids for Covalent Binding of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Structural Basis and Application to Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of G4&#8208;targeting organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, designed to covalently bind to the G4 binding site, could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway, induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and stimulate potent immunotherapy in vivo. This study highlights the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent binding in G4&#8208;targeting drug design.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been revived as promising therapeutic targets with the development of immunotherapy, but the G4&#8208;mediated immune response remains unclear. We designed a novel class of G4&#8208;binding organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, with spatial matching for G4 binding and G4 DNA reactivity for binding site locking. The solution structure of L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;MYT1L G4 demonstrated the effectiveness of the covalent binding and revealed the covalent binding&#8208;guided dynamic balance, accompanied by the destruction of the A5&#8208;T17 base pairs to achieve the covalent binding of the platinum unit to N7 of the G6 residue. Furthermore, L1&#8208;cispt&#8208; and L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;mediated genomic dysfunction could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). The use of L1&#8208;cispt/L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;treated dying cells as therapeutic vaccines stimulated a robust immune response and effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent locking in G4&#8208;trageting drug design and their potential in immunotherapy.

         <title>Unidirectional Sidechain Engineering to Construct Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Acceptors for 19.23&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Energy Loss and Efficient Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptor is developed using unidirectional sidechain engineering. Thanks to the low energy loss and efficient charge transfer properties, the corresponding organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values among annealing&#8208;free devices.







Abstract
Achieving both high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) to boost power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) is a major challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs), wherein high energy loss (Eloss) and inefficient charge transfer usually take place. Here, three new Y&#8208;series acceptors of mono&#8208;asymmetric asy&#8208;YC11 and dual&#8208;asymmetric bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC9 and bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 are developed. They share the same asymmetric D1AD2 (D1=thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and D2=selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) fused&#8208;core but have different unidirectional sidechain on D1 side, allowing fine&#8208;tuned molecular properties, such as intermolecular interaction, packing pattern, and crystallinity. Among the binary blends, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 one has better morphology with appropriate phase separation and higher order packing than the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;asy&#8208;YC9 and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC11 ones. Therefore, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs offer a higher PCE of 17.16&#8201;% with both high Voc and Jsc, due to the reduced Eloss and efficient charge transfer properties. Inspired by the high Voc and strong NIR&#8208;absorption, bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 is introduced into efficient binary PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO to construct ternary OSCs. Thanks to the broadened absorption, optimized morphology, and furtherly minimized Eloss, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion PCE of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among these annealing&#8208;free devices. Our developed unidirectional sidechain engineering for constructing bi&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptors provides an approach to boost PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Deciphering Reversible Homogeneous Catalysis of the Electrochemical H2 Evolution and Oxidation: Role of Proton Relays and Local Concentration Effects
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analytical treatment allows determining all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen mediated by DuBois/Shaw nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant bases. This analysis shed light on the key activity descriptors responsible for reversible vs. bidirectional catalysis and paves the way towards rational optimization of such molecular catalysts







Abstract
Nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant amines form a unique series of catalysts (so&#8208;called DuBois&#8217; catalysts) capable of bidirectional/reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen. This unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed close to the metal center. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a mechanistic model and its kinetic treatment that may apply to all DuBois&#8217; catalysts and show that it allows for a good fit of experimental data measured at different pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from balanced equilibria related to hydrogen uptake/evolution on one side and (metal)&#8208;hydride installation/capture on the other side, both controlled by concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays and connected by two square schemes corresponding to proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. We show that the catalytic bias is controlled by the kinetic of the H2 uptake/evolution step. Reversibility does not require that the energy landscape be flat, with redox transitions occurring at potentials up to 250&#8197;mV away for the equilibrium potential, although such large deviations from a flat energy landscape can negatively impacts the rate of catalysis when coupled with slow interfacial electron transfer kinetics.

         <title>Atomically Precise Copper Nanoclusters for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 towards Hydrocarbons via Breaking the Coordination Symmetry of Cu Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the coordination symmetry of Cu site in atomically precise Cu6 cluster to form Cu&#8208;S2N1 site, which rank the dx2&#8208;y2 orbital as the highest occupied d orbital to favor the specific coordination between C atom of CO2 and Cu&#8722;S2N1 site. This binding mode is conductive to the generation of *COOH instead of *OCHO, thereby switching the product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons.







Abstract
We propose an effective highest occupied d&#8208;orbital modulation strategy engendered by breaking the coordination symmetry of sites in the atomically precise Cu nanocluster (NC) to switch the product of CO2 electroreduction from HCOOH/CO to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons. An atomically well&#8208;defined Cu6 NC with symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 active sites (named Cu6(MBD)6, MBD=2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole) was designed and synthesized by a judicious choice of ligand containing both S and N coordination atoms. Different from the previously reported high HCOOH selectivity of Cu NCs with Cu&#8722;S3 sites, the Cu6(MBD)6 with Cu&#8722;S2N1 coordination structure shows a high Faradaic efficiency toward hydrocarbons of 65.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (including 42.5&#8201;% CH4 and 23&#8201;% C2H4), with the hydrocarbons partial current density of &#8722;183.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 sites can rearrange the Cu 3d orbitals with 
 as the highest occupied d&#8208;orbital, thus favoring the generation of key intermediate *COOH instead of *OCHO to favor *CO formation, followed by hydrogenation and/or C&#8722;C coupling to produce hydrocarbons. This is the first attempt to regulate the coordination mode of Cu atom in Cu NCs for hydrocarbons generation, and provides new inspiration for designing atomically precise NCs for efficient CO2RR towards highly&#8208;valued products.

         <title>Automated Generation of Microkinetics for Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reactions Considering Correlated Uncertainties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study presents an ab&#8208;initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first&#8208;principles&#8208;based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange&#8208;correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT&#8208;constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation with Polyhydride Ni/Ga Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic cluster [Ni3(GaTMP)7] reversibly forms di&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and hexahydride species under hydrogen pressure in solution, that were characterized by low temperature COSY and ROESY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. The work conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal main&#8208;group bimetallic clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.







Abstract
The bimetallic, decanuclear Ni3Ga7&#8208;cluster of the formula [Ni3(GaTMP)3(&#956;2&#8208;GaTMP)3(&#956;3&#8208;GaTMP)] (1, TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl) reacts reversibly with dihydrogen under the formation of a series of (poly&#8208;)hydride clusters 2. Low&#8208;temperature 2D NMR experiments at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C show that 2 consist of a mixture of a di&#8208; (2Di), tetra&#8208; (2Tetra) and hexahydride species (2Hexa). The structures of 2Di and 2Tetra are assessed by a combination of 2D NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The cooperation of both metals is essential for the high hydrogen uptake of the cluster. Polyhydrides 2 are catalytically active in the semihydrogenation of 4&#8208;octyne to 4&#8208;octene with good selectivity. The example is the first of its kind and conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal/main group metal clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial MVs induced silent secondary metabolite production in a wide range of bacteria by imitating interbacterial interactions. X.&#8197;innexi activated the production of xeinamides, xeidopeptides and xenoamicins through quorum sensing suppression by B.&#8197;multivorans MVs treatment. Xenoamicins carried in X.&#8197;innexi MVs suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, indicating interbacterial hostile interaction by MVs and secondary metabolites.







Abstract
Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B.&#8197;multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X.&#8197;innexi. In turn, the X.&#8197;innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B.&#8197;multivorans and X.&#8197;innexi through MV exchange.

         <title>Linkage Microenvironment of Azoles&#8208;Related Covalent Organic Frameworks Precisely Regulates Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable covalent organic framework (COF) platform with three azole&#8208;related linkages was prepared through linker exchange reactions. The linkage microenvironment changes the photoelectric properties and photocatalytic performance. The thiazole linkage was more favorable for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production than that of the oxazole and imidazole linkages.







Abstract
Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts is promising for wastewater treatment. The effect of linkage chemistry of COFs as functional basis to photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalysis remains a significant challenge. In this study, three kinds of azoles&#8208;linked COFs including thiazole&#8208;linked TZ&#8208;COF, oxazole&#8208;linked OZ&#8208;COF and imidazole&#8208;linked IZ&#8208;COF were successfully synthesized. More accessible channels of charge transfer were constructed in TZ&#8208;COF via the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure between thiazole linkage and pyrene linker, leading to efficient suppression of photoexcited charge recombination. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental studies, demonstrating that the thiazole linkage is more favorable for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production than that of the oxazole and imidazole linkages. The real active sites in COFs located at the benzene ring fragment between pyrene unit and azole linkage.

         <title>Nonclassical Crystallization Causes Dendritic and Band&#8208;Like Microscale Patterns in Inorganic Precipitates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic experiments yield compositionally pure Ni(OH)2 membranes that show internal microscale structures such as parallel bands, dendritic trees, and disorganized spots. These light&#8208;scattering patterns result from nonclassical crystallization and nanoparticle aggregation. The particles form in the flowing NiCl2 solution and self&#8208;organize aggregation zones&#8212;that for band patterns&#8212;move over the membrane surface in the upstream direction.







Abstract
The self&#8208;organization of complex solids can create patterns extending hierarchically from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. A frequently studied model is the chemical garden system which consists of life&#8208;like precipitate shapes. In this study, we examine the thin walls of chemical gardens using microfluidic devices that yield linear Ni(OH)2 precipitate membranes. We observe distinct light&#8208;scattering patterns within the compositionally pure membranes, including disorganized spots, dendrites, and parallel bands. The bands are tilted with respect to the membrane axis and their spacing (20&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;m) increases with increasing flow rates. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the bands consist of submicron particles embedded in a denser material and these particles are also found in the reactant stream. We propose that dendrites and bands arise from the attachment of solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles. The bands are generated by particle&#8208;aggregation zones moving upstream along the slowly advancing membrane surface. The speed of the aggregation zones is proportional to the band distance and defines the system's dispersion relation. This speed&#8208;wavelength dependence and the flow&#8208;opposing motion of the aggregation zones are likely caused by low particle concentrations in the wake of the zones that only slowly recover due to Brownian motion and particle nucleation.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Organoboron Species as Lewis Superacids and Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils a T&#8208;shaped organoboron system with three stable oxidation states, which allowed for the isolation of geometrically constrained superacidic boron dication, ambiphilic boron radical cation and superbasic borylene.







Abstract
This report unveils an advancement in the formation of a Lewis superacid (LSA) and an organic superbase by the geometrical deformation of an organoboron species towards a T&#8208;shaped geometry. The boron dication [2]2+ supported by an amido diphosphine pincer ligand features both a large fluoride ion affinity (FIA&gt;SbF5) and hydride ion affinity (HIA&gt;B(C6F5)3), which qualifies it as both a hard and soft LSA. The unusual Lewis acidic properties of [2]2+ are further showcased by its ability to abstract hydride and fluoride from Et3SiH and AgSbF6 respectively, and effectively catalyze the hydrodefluorination, defluorination/arylation, as well as reduction of carbonyl compounds. One and two&#8208;electron reduction of [2]2+ affords stable boron radical cation [2]&#8901;+ and borylene 2, respectively. The former species has an extremely high spin density of 0.798e at the boron atom, whereas the latter compound has been demonstrated to be a strong organic base (calcd. pKBH+ (MeCN)=47.4) by both theoretical and experimental assessment. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong ability of geometric constraining to empower the central boron atom.

The boron dication [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; supported by an amido diphosphine pincer ligand features both a large fluoride ion affinity (FIA&amp;gt;SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydride ion affinity (HIA&amp;gt;B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which qualifies it as both a hard and soft LSA. The unusual Lewis acidic properties of [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are further showcased by its ability to abstract hydride and fluoride from Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH and AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, and effectively catalyze the hydrodefluorination, defluorination/arylation, as well as reduction of carbonyl compounds. One and two-electron reduction of [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; affords stable boron radical cation [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and borylene &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. The former species has an extremely high spin density of 0.798&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; at the boron atom, whereas the latter compound has been demonstrated to be a strong organic base (calcd. p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (MeCN)=47.4) by both theoretical and experimental assessment. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong ability of geometric constraining to empower the central boron atom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework with Oxidative and Reductive Sites for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline network is constructed by incorporating rhenium complexes and triazine ring structures as catalytic sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bonding. Appreciable charge&#8208;separation and transfer efficiency drive both the photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions in the conversion of CO2 to CO with H2O, and without any additional sacrificial agents or photosensitizers.







Abstract
Constructing a powerful photocatalytic system that can achieve the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction half&#8208;reaction and the water (H2O) oxidation half&#8208;reaction simultaneously is a very challenging but meaningful task. Herein, a porous material with a crystalline topological network, named viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re, was rationally synthesized by incorporating rhenium complexes as reductive sites and triazine ring structures as oxidative sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bond linkages. The charge&#8208;separation ability of viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re is promoted by low polarized &#960;&#8208;bridges between rhenium complexes and triazine ring units, and the efficient charge&#8208;separation enables the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs, followed by an intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer process, to form photogenerated electrons involved in CO2 reduction and photogenerated holes that participate in H2O oxidation simultaneously. The viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re shows the highest catalytic photocatalytic carbon monoxide (CO) production rate (190.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with about 100&#8201;% selectivity) and oxygen (O2) evolution (90.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among all the porous catalysts in CO2 reduction with H2O as sacrificial agents. Therefore, a powerful photocatalytic system was successfully achieved, and this catalytic system exhibited excellent stability in the catalysis process for 50&#8197;hours. The structure&#8211;function relationship was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

         <dc:description>
A straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis allows the microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) photocatalyst UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to expand its porosity with a tailored pore environment. The resulting material accommodates single&#8208;site Cu species, shows significant mesoporosity and enhanced charge photogeneration. It has excellent performance in photocatalytic reactions for the functionalization of terminal alkynes.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with expanding porosity and tailored pore environments are intriguing for catalytic applications. We report herein a straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis to introduce desirable mesopores into mono&#8208;ligand MOFs, which is different from the classical thermolyzing method that starts from mixed&#8208;linker MOFs. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, after partial ligand thermolysis, exhibits significant mesoporosity, retained crystal structure, improved charge photogeneration and abundant anchoring sites, which is ideal to explore single&#8208;site photocatalysis. Atomically dispersed Cu is then accommodated in the tailored pore. The resulting single&#8208;site Cu catalyst exhibits excellent performance for photocatalytic alkylation and oxidation coupling for the functionalization of terminal alkynes. The study highlights the advantage of controlled partial linker thermolysis to synthesize hierarchical MOFs to achieve the advanced single&#8208;site photocatalysis.

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics from Metallacages for Mimicking Light&#8208;Harvesting Antenna</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalent organic cages with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized metallacages. These covalent cages performed well as energy donors for the construction of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems for the photocatalytic dehalogenation reaction.







Abstract
A series of covalent organic cages built from fluorophores capable of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized M2(LA)3(LB)2&#8208;type metallacages, simultaneously taking advantage of the synthetic accessibility and well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of metallacages, the good chemical stability of the covalent cages as well as the bright emission of AIE fluorophores. Moreover, the covalent cages could be further post&#8208;synthetically modified into an amide&#8208;functionalized cage with a higher quantum yield. Furthermore, these presented covalent cages proved to be good energy donors and were used to construct light&#8208;harvesting systems employing Nile Red as an energy acceptor. These light&#8208;harvesting systems displayed efficient energy transfer and relatively high antenna effect, which enabled their use as efficient photocatalysts for a dehalogenation reaction. This research provides a new avenue for the development of luminescent covalent cages for light&#8208;harvesting and photocatalysis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Units as Photocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs) were prepared with different donor building units. Their photophysical studies indicated that the Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs with higher charge&#8208;carrier density and longer conjugation length led to a more efficient charge separation with a reduced exciton binding energy, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction into CO.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a promising platform for photocatalysts. Their crystalline porous nature allows comprehensive mechanistic studies of photocatalysis, which have revealed that their general photophysical parameters, such as light absorption ability, electronic band structure, and charge separation efficiency, can be conveniently tailored by structural modifications. However, further understanding of the relationship between structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity is required from the viewpoint of charge&#8208;carrier transport, because the charge&#8208;carrier property is closely related to alleviation of the excitonic effect. In the present study, COFs composed of a fixed cobalt (Co) porphyrin (Por) centered tetraamine as an acceptor unit with differently conjugated di&#8208;carbaldehyde based donor units, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), thienothiophene (TT), or phenyl (TA), were synthesized to form Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT, Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT, or Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide was in the order of Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA. The results indicated that the excitonic effect, associated with their charge&#8208;carrier densities and &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, was a significant factor in photocatalysis performance.

         <title>Discovery of Two&#8208;dimensional Hexagonal MBene HfBO and Exploration on its Potential for Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of DFT calculations and experiments were used to discover a large class of exfoliable h&#8208;MAB phases and their derivative h&#8208;MBenes. A representative 2D h&#8208;MBene, HfBO, was successfully synthesized by selectively etching the In layers from Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO was demonstrated to show lithium&#8208;ion storage performance for the first time.







Abstract
The practical applications of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal borides (MBenes) have been severely hindered by the lack of accessible MBenes because of the difficulties in the selective etching of traditional ternary MAB phases with orthorhombic symmetry (ort&#8208;MAB). Here, we discover a family of ternary hexagonal MAB (h&#8208;MAB) phases and 2D hexagonal MBenes (h&#8208;MBenes) by ab initio predictions and experiments. Calculations suggest that the ternary h&#8208;MAB phases are more suitable precursors for MBenes than the ort&#8208;MAB phases. Based on the prediction, we report the experimental synthesis of h&#8208;MBene HfBO by selective removal of In from h&#8208;MAB Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO delivered a specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, demonstrating the potential for energy&#8208;storage applications. The discovery of this h&#8208;MBene HfBO added a new member to the growing family of 2D materials and provided opportunities for a wide range of novel applications.

         <title>Gallium Triggers Ferroptosis through a Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga&#8208;1 anchors to mitochondria by binding to the membrane phospholipids and results in the dysfunction of the electron transfer chain as well as iron release, eventually triggering ferroptosis. In addition, Ga&#8208;1 inhibits protein disulfide isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum, breaking the antioxidant glutathione system. Both actions synergistically induce ferroptosis. In addition, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid enhances ferroptosis.







Abstract
The gallium ion (Ga3+) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non&#8208;apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (Ga&#8208;1); we found that Ga&#8208;1 acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, Ga&#8208;1 also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of Ga&#8208;1 and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti&#8208;neoplastic effect.

         <title>Nucleophilic Attack at Pentaarsaferrocene [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)]&#8208;The Way to Larger Polyarsenide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective way for the nucleophilic substitution of the cyclo&#8208;As5 ligand in [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) was found, resulting in first As5R entities. By the reduction of I, an access to the dianionic compound [(Cp*Fe)2{&#956;&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;As10}]2&#8722; (4), and by using As&#8208;based nucleophiles, the straightforward formation of tetramers representing the largest polyarsenide&#8208;containing (As20) molecular complexes could be achieved.







Abstract
By the reaction of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp*=C5Me5) with main group nucleophiles, unique functionalized products with &#951;4&#8208;coordinated polyarsenide (Asn) units (n=5, 6, 20) are obtained. With carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles such as MeLi or KBn (Bn=CH2Ph), the anionic organo&#8208;substituted polyarsenide complexes, [Li(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5Me)] (1&#8201;a) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe{&#951;4&#8208;As5(CH2Ph)}] (1&#8201;b), are accessible. The use of KAsPh2 leads to a selective and controlled extension of the As5 unit and the formation of the monoanionic compound [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6Ph2)] (2). When I is reacted with [M]As(SiMe3)2 (M=Li&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF; K), the formation of the largest known anionic polyarsenide unit in [M&#8242;(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(Cp*Fe)4{&#956;5&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4:&#951;3:&#951;3:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;As20}] (3) occurred (M&#8242;=Li (3&#8201;a), K (3&#8201;b)).

         <title>Fast Polysulfide Conversion Catalysis and Reversible Anode Operation by A Single Cathode Modifier in Li&#8208;Metal Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functionalities were enabled by a single cathode modifier: i)&#8197;for the cathode, it can work as an effective catalyst to promote cathode reaction kinetics; ii)&#8197;for the anode, trace amounts of dissolved In and Se ions are incorporated as LiInS2 and LiInSe2 in the anode solid electrolyte interface to facilitate reversible Li deposition/stripping.







Abstract
The two major issues confronting the commercialization of rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur electrochemical reactions on the cathode and inadequate lithium deposition/stripping reversibility on the anode. They are commonly mitigated with additives designed specifically for the anode and the cathode individually. Here, we report the use of a single cathode modifier, In2Se3, which can effectively catalyse the polysulfide reactions on the cathode, and also improve the reversibility of Li deposition and removal on the anode through a LiInS2/LiInSe2 containing solid electrolyte interface formed in situ by the Se and In ions dissolved in the electrolyte. The amounts of dissolved Se and In are small relative to the amount of In2Se3 administered. The benefits of using this single modification approach were verified in Li&#8208;metal anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;S batteries with a Li2S loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low electrolyte/Li2S ratio of 7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The resulting battery showed 60&#8201;% capacity retention after 160&#8197;cycles at the 0.2&#8197;C rate and an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.27&#8201;%, comparing very well with recent studies using separate electrode modifiers.

         <title>Chiral PSiSi&#8208;Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Silylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral pincer silyl ligand is developed, which enables an Iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction. Key to the success of this transformation relies on using a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the C&#8722;H silylation process with high chem&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation offers an efficient approach for the rapid construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, but remains a significant challenge. Herein, a new type of chiral silyl ligand is developed, which enables the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction of 2&#8208;arylisoquinolines. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, and remarkable yield with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee), delivering enantioenriched axially chiral silane platform molecules with facile convertibility. Key to the success of this unprecedented transformation relies on a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation process with perfect chem&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.

         <title>Bis&#8208; and Tris&#8208;norbornadienes with High Energy Densities for Efficient Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems can convert, store and release solar energy in chemical bonds, i.e., as chemical energy. In this work, phenyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;norbornadienes are presented as promising MOST systems with very high energy densities. The substrates were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions and their absorption properties and characteristic parameters for MOST applications were investigated. The norbornadiene derivatives showed absorption onsets of up to 386 nm and photoisomerization quantum yields of 56% per photoisomerization event. The resulting quadricyclane products have half&#8208;lifes up to 14 d and very high energy densities of up to 734 KJ/Kg. Overall, these norbornadienes fulfill necessary criteria for an optimal MOST system and are, therefore, a highly promising basis for the development of materials for efficient solar energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk and Surface Contributions to Ionisation Potentials of Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determining the absolute band edge positions in solid materials is crucial for optimising their performance in wide&#8208;ranging applications including photocatalysis and electronic devices. However, obtaining absolute energies is challenging, as seen in CeO2, where experimental measurements show substantial discrepancies in the ionisation potential (IP). Here, we have combined several theoretical approaches, from classical electrostatics to quantum mechanics, to elucidate the bulk and surface contributions to the IP of metal oxides. We have determined a theoretical bulk contribution to the IP of stoichiometric CeO2 of only 5.38 eV, while surface orientation results in intrinsic IP variations from 4.2 eV to 8.2 eV. Highly tuneable IPs were also found in TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, in which surface polarisation plays a pivotal role in long&#8208;range energy level shifting. Our analysis, in addition to rationalising the observed range of experimental results, provides a firm basis for future interpretations of experimental and computational studies of oxide band structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Xylene Synthesis Through Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation and Toluene Methylation Over a Composite ZnZrO Zeolite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective synthesis of specific value&#8208;added aromatics from CO2 hydrogenation is of paramount interest for mitigating energy and climate problems caused by CO2 emission. Herein, we report a highly active composite catalyst of ZnZrO and HZSM&#8208;5 (ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG) for xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation via coupling reaction in the presence of toluene, achieving a xylene selectivity of 86.5% with CO2 conversion of 10.5%. A remarkably high space time yield of xylene could reach 215 mg gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, transcending most reported catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The enhanced performance of ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG could be owing to high dispersion and abundant oxygen vacancies of ZZO component for CO2 adsorption, more feasible hydrogen activation and transfer due to the close interaction between two components, and enhanced stability of the formate intermediate. The consumption of methoxy and methanol from the deep hydrogenation of formate by introduced toluene also propels an oriented conversion of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;emissive Iridium(III) Complexes as Phosphorescent Probes with Orthogonal Responses to Analyte Binding and Oxygen Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorescent probes often show sensitive response toward analytes at a specific wavelength. However, oxygen quenching usually occurs at the same wavelength and thus hinders the accurate detection of analytes. In this study, we have developed dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes that exhibit phosphorescence responses to copper(II) ions at a wavelength distinct from that where oxygen quenching occurs. The complexes displayed colorimetric phosphorescence response in aqueous solutions under different copper(II) and oxygen conditions. In cellular imaging, variation in oxygen concentration over a large range from 5% to 80% can modulate the intensity and lifetime of green phosphorescence without affecting the response of red phosphorescence toward intracellular copper(II) ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Aggregation to Chaperon NPs Across Fluid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles (NPs) transfer is usually induced by adding ligands to modify NP surfaces, but aggregation of NPs oftentimes hampers the transfer. Here, we show that aggregation during NP phase transfer does not necessarily result in transfer failure. Using a model system comprising gold NPs and amphiphilic polymers, we demonstrate an unusual mechanism by which NPs can undergo phase transfer from the aqueous phase to the organic phase via a single&#8208;aggregation&#8208;single pathway. Our discovery challenges the conventional idea that aggregation inhibits NP transfer and provides an unexpected pathway for transferring larger&#8208;sized NPs (&gt; 20 nm). The charged amphiphilic polymers effectively act as chaperons for the NP transfer and offer a unique way to manipulate the dispersion and distribution of NPs in two immiscible liquids. Moreover, by intentionally jamming the NP&#8208;polymer assembly at the liquid/liquid interface, the transfer process can be inhibited.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Pt Single Atoms through Pt&#8211;Se Electron Bridges on Vacancy&#8208;enriched Nickel Selenide for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts provides a promising strategy to significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. The enriched vacancies of nickel selenide substrate supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst was prepared via a hydrothermal&#8208;impregnation stepwise approach. Through experimental testation and DFT theoretical calculation, we confirm that Pt single atoms are well loaded at cationic vacancies of nickel selenide with loading of 3.2 wt. %. Moreover, the atomic Pt combined with the high electronegative Se to from Pt&#8208;Se bond as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between single atoms and substrate for fast electron translation. The novel catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 45 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability over 120 h. Furthermore, the nickel selenide support Pt SACs exhibits long&#8208;term stability for practical application, which maintains a high current density of 390 mA cm&#8208;2 over 80 h with a retention of 99 %. This work points a promising direction for designing single atoms catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for advanced green energy conversion technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxy&#8208;rich Fe Single Atom Sites Boost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe single atom catalysts with sulfur and epoxy groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions. The presence of sulfur and epoxy groups modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, while the epoxy group also participate in the reduction reaction through reversible cleavage, lowering the energy barrier by functioning as an anchor site for OH* intermediates.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for energy conversion and storage devices. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88&#8197;V), Fe single atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89&#8197;V) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The spectroscopic measurements reveal that the presence of sulfur group induces the formation of epoxy groups near the FeN4S2 centers, which not only modulate the electronic structure of Fe single atoms but also participate the catalytic process to improve the kinetics. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate&#8208;limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanode prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition was first unraveled to mainly result from the phase impurity caused by the relatively easy vanadium volatilization. Consequently, a BiVO4 photoanode free of tetragonal phase and decorated with NiFeOx cocatalyst was fabricated to exhibit a benchmark photocurrent density.







Abstract
Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO4 prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25&#8197;cm2), demonstrating the advantage of MOD method in scalable preparation. Our work provides new insight and highlights the glorious future of MOD method for the design of scale&#8208;up efficient BiVO4 photoanode.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Carbonylation of Light and Heavy Hydrocarbons with Carbon Monoxide via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalysis in Flow
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient C&#8722;H functionalization process, enabling the regioselective installation of carbonyls in light and heavy hydrocarbons by using inexpensive carbon monoxide. Safe processing of hazardous CO and flammable alkanes is ensured in flow, with high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics. Our method demonstrates the valorization of gaseous reagents, coupling light alkanes, CO, and an olefin as a terminal radical trap.







Abstract
Despite their abundance in organic molecules, considerable limitations still exist in synthetic methods that target the direct C&#8722;H functionalization at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. This is even more the case for light alkanes, which bear some of the strongest C&#8722;H bonds known in Nature, requiring extreme activation conditions that are not tolerant to most organic molecules. To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C&#8722;H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8722;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.

         <title>Atomic Insights into Synergistic Nitroarene Hydrogenation over Nanodiamond&#8208;Supported Pt1&#8722;Fe1 Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method was developed for Pt1&#8722;Fe1/nanodiamond dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst construction. Synergistic chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes was achieved, whereby hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and nitro group is preferentially adsorbed at the Fe1 site.

Fundamental understanding of the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts is of extreme significance in heterogeneous catalysis, but a great challenge lies in the precise construction of uniform dual&#8208;metal sites. Here, we develop a novel method for constructing Pt1&#8722;Fe1/ND dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, by anchoring Pt single atoms on Fe1&#8722;N4 sites decorating a nanodiamond (ND) surface. Using this catalyst, the synergy of nitroarenes selective hydrogenation is revealed. In detail, hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and the nitro group is strongly adsorbed on the Fe1 site via a vertical configuration for subsequent hydrogenation. Such synergistic effect decreases the activation energy and results in an unprecedented catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, 24 types of substrates). Our findings advance the applications of dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts in selective hydrogenations and open up a new way to explore the nature of synergistic catalysis at the atomic level.

&lt;p&gt;A simple method was developed for Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/nanodiamond dual-single-atom catalyst construction. Synergistic chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes was achieved, whereby hydrogen is activated on the Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dual site and nitro group is preferentially adsorbed at the Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site. The activation energy is decreased, resulting in an appreciable catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, and a scope of 24 substrates).

         <title>Enhanced Spatial Charge Separation in a Niobium and Tantalum Nitride Core&#8208;Shell Photoanode: In Situ Interface Bonding for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electron/hole separation and collection has been achieved by in situ interface bonding of an ultrathin high&#8208;crystallinity Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell and conductive NbNx nanorod core. The photoanode attains a photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V RHE with a Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has emerged as a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the inefficient electron&#8208;hole separation remains a bottleneck that impedes its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a core&#8211;shell nanoarray photoanode of NbNx&#8208;nanorod@Ta3N5 ultrathin layer enhances light harvesting and forms a spatial charge&#8208;transfer channel, which leads to the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. Consequently, an impressive photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE is obtained with an ultrathin Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm, accompanied by excellent stability and a low onset potential (0.46&#8197;VRHE). Mechanistic studies reveal the enhanced performance is attributed to the high&#8208;conductivity NbNx core, high&#8208;crystalline Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell, and the intimate Ta&#8722;N&#8722;Nb interface bonds, which accelerate the charge&#8208;separation capability of the core&#8211;shell photoanode. This study demonstrates the key roles of nanostructure design in improving the efficiency of PEC devices.

         <title>The Keto&#8208;Switched Photocatalysis of Reconstructed Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local reconstruction of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) unlocks visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic H2 evolution. The keto units in skeletal building blocks are active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons are emitted to Pt nanoparticles across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer for reduction of protons to H2. A new benchmark H2 production rate of 53&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
The keto&#8208;switched photocatalysis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient H2 evolution was reported for the first time by engineering, at a molecular level, the local structure and component of the skeletal building blocks. A series of imine&#8208;linked BT&#8208;COFs were synthesized by the Schiff&#8208;base reaction of 1, 3, 5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde with diamines to demonstrate the structural reconstruction of enol to keto configurations by alkaline catalysis. The keto groups of the skeletal building blocks served as active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons were provided to Pt nanoparticles (NPs) across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer. The characterization results, together with density functional theory calculations, indicated clearly that the formation of keto&#8208;injectors not only made the conduction band level more negative, but also led to an inhomogeneous charge distribution in the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular building blocks to form a strong intramolecular built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, visible&#8208;light photocatalysis of TP&#8208;COFs&#8208;1 with one keto group in the skeletal building blocks was successfully enabled and achieved an impressive H2 evolution rate as high as 0.96&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Also, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of the reconstructed BT&#8208;COFs&#8208;2 and &#8208;3 with two and three keto&#8208;injectors were significantly enhanced by alkaline post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Relaxing Wrinkles in Jammed Interfacial Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autonomous stress&#8208;relaxation by dynamic jammed assemblies of nanoparticles and lipids at the interface was demonstrated. Such a lipid&#8208;based self&#8208;relaxing system may find applications in soft robots, medical and materials applications.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent bonding has emerged as a mean by which stresses in a network can be relaxed. Here, the strength of the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible liquids affect the same results in jammed assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants. Beyond a critical degree of overcrowding induced by the compression of jammed interfacial assemblies, the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles (NPs) can be broken, resulting in a desorption of the NPs from the interface. This reduces the areal density of nanoparticle surfactants at the interface, allowing the assemblies to relax, not to a fluid state but rather another jammed state. The relaxation of the wrinkles caused by the compression reflects the tendency of these assemblies to eliminate areas of high curvature, favoring a more planar geometry. This enabled the generation of giant vesicular and multivesicular structures from these assemblies.

         <title>Overlooked Formation of Carbonate Radical Anions in the Oxidation of Iron(II) by Oxygen in the Presence of Bicarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#8901;&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;) is shown. The results highlight the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon and show that the presence of bicarbonate dramatically changes the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction of Fe(H2O)62++O2 under physiological and environmental conditions.







Abstract
Iron(II), (Fe(H2O)62+, (FeII) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of FeII oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O2, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO3&#8722;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O2&#8901;&#8722;, H2O2, and HO&#8901;) in FeII oxidation by O2 has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#8901;&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO3&#8722;. The rate of the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; may be expressed as d[CO3&#8901;&#8722;]/dt=[FeII[[O2][HCO3&#8722;]2. The formation of reactive species was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of FeII oxidation by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.

&lt;p&gt;Iron(II), (Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, (Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and HO&#8901;) in Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in the oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The rate of the formation of CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; may be expressed as d[CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;]/dt=[Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;[[O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The formation of reactive species was investigated using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Given their chemical and structural variability, dynamic organic and coordination cage architectures are increasingly being used in the formation of more complex systems&#8212;smart materials. In this Review we present basic know&#8208;how for modifying active surfaces with cage systems. The structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the cage used and the potential application of the obtained systems are also discussed.







Abstract
The interest in capsular assemblies such as dynamic organic and coordination cages has blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural variability, these systems have found applications in diverse fields of research, including energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation, molecular recognition, and live&#8208;cell imaging. In the exploration of the potential of these discrete architectures, they are increasingly being employed in the formation of more complex systems and smart materials. This Review highlights the most promising pathways to overcome common drawbacks of cage systems (stability, recovery) and discusses the most promising strategies for their hybridization with systems featuring various dimensionalities. Following the description of the most recent advances in the fabrication of zero to three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;based systems, this Review will provide the reader with the structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the employed cages and the properties of the materials.

         <title>Synergistic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Active Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Cage for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stable CoII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages are efficient catalysts for photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 in pure water and O2 or air atmospheres. The metal&#8208;nonmetal active site operates synergistically during photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis and the reaction substrate can more fully contact the catalytically active site through host&#8211;guest chemistry of cages, ultimately achieving a high H2O2 production rate.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potential clean method, but the long distance between the oxidation and reduction sites in photocatalysts hinders the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges, limiting the improvement of its performance. Here, a metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst, Co14(L&#8722;CH3)24, is constructed by directly coordinating metal sites (Co sites) used for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with non&#8208;metallic sites (imidazole sites of ligands) used for the H2O oxidation reaction (WOR), which shortens the transport path of photogenerated electrons and holes, and improves the transport efficiency of charges and activity of the photocatalyst. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 production under O2&#8208;saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time; i.e., to build a synergistic metal&#8208;nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host&#8211;guest chemistry inherent in the metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC)to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytically active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Coupling Benzylamine Oxidation with CO2 Photoconversion to Ethanol over a Black Phosphorus and Bismuth Tungstate S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction for efficient ethanol production is challenging. A 2D/2D S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction comprised of black phosphorus and bismuth tungstate (BP/BWO) was constructed for CO2 reduction, coupled with benzylamine (BA) oxidation to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BDA). The catalyst generates ethanol with high yield and selectivity. This work provides insight into heterogeneous photocatalysts based on cooperative photoredox systems.







Abstract
Photoconversion of CO2 and H2O into ethanol is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of ethanol with high activity and selectivity is challenging owing to the less efficient reduction half&#8208;reaction involving multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), a slow C&#8722;C coupling process, and sluggish water oxidation half&#8208;reaction. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction consisting of black phosphorus and Bi2WO6 (BP/BWO) was constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupling with benzylamine (BA) oxidation. The as&#8208;prepared BP/BWO catalyst exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance toward CO2 reduction, with a yield of 61.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethanol (selectivity of 91&#8201;%).In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that S&#8208;scheme heterojunction can effectively promote photogenerated carrier separation via the Bi&#8722;O&#8722;P bridge to accelerate the PCET process. Meanwhile, electron&#8208;rich BP acts as the active site and plays a vital role in the process of C&#8722;C coupling. In addition, the substitution of BA oxidation for H2O oxidation can further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction to C2H5OH. This work opens a new horizon for exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in CO2 photoconversion to C2H5OH based on cooperative photoredox systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing organic materials can absorb externally provided nutrient compounds to modify their sizes, shapes, structures, and properties. This Minireview describes the concept of these materials and their recent progress, including the self&#8208;growing strategies, mass transport mechanisms in growth, simulation models, and potential applications. It provides researchers with a comprehensive understanding of this emerging new field.







Abstract
The growth of living systems is ubiquitous. Living organisms can continually update their sizes, shapes, and properties to meet various environmental challenges. Such a capability is also demonstrated by emerging self&#8208;growing materials that can incorporate externally provided compounds to grow as living organisms. In this Minireview, we summarize these materials in terms of six aspects. First, we discuss their essential characteristics, then describe the strategies for enabling crosslinked organic materials to self&#8208;grow from nutrient solutions containing polymerizable compounds. The developed examples are grouped into five categories based on their molecular mechanisms. We then explain the mechanism of mass transport within polymer networks during growth, which is critical for controlling the shape and morphology of the grown products. Afterwards, simulation models built to explain the interesting phenomena observed in self&#8208;growing materials are discussed. The development of self&#8208;growing materials is accompanied by various applications, including tuning bulk properties, creating textured surfaces, growth&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, 4D printing, self&#8208;growing implants, actuation, self&#8208;growing structural coloration, and others. These examples are then summed up. Finally, we discuss the opportunities brought by self&#8208;growing materials and their facing challenges.

         <title>Mild Synthesis of Polychlorinated Arenes for Efficient Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with Dual Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polychlorinated (hetero)arenes have shown great promise for organic optoelectronics applications. However, the harsh synthesis of polychlorinated compounds and the possible luminescence quenching from the compact intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking induced by chlorine atoms limit their investigations and applications in luminescent materials. Herein, two isomeric polychlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds JY&#8208;1&#8208;Cl and JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl consisting of rigidified aryl ketones and amine are designed and synthesized under mild conditions through nucleophilic chlorination intermediated by electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex. Among them, due to the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions induced by chlorine atoms, JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl exhibits bright monomer and dimer emissions with dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characters. Notably, in compared with the non&#8208;chlorinated compounds, high photoluminescence quantum yield is well maintained after introducing multiple chlorine atoms in JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl. Eventually, the first dual&#8208;TADF organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are also successfully fabricated with maximum external quantum efficiency as high as 29.1% employing JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl as emitter. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of polychlorinated amine&#8208;carbonyl PAHs and demonstrates the great potential of the chlorinated materials for luminescent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External Stimulus&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic processes involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a kinetic bottleneck due to the existence of linear&#8208;scaling relationships, which bind the energies of the different intermediates in the mechanism limiting optimization. Here, we offer a way to break these scaling relationships and enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a Co&#8211;Fe Prussian blue modified electrode in OER by applying external stimuli. Improvements of ~11% and ~57% were achieved under magnetic field (0.2 T) and light irradiation (100 mW.cm&#8722;2), respectively, when working at fixed overpotential, &#414; = 0.6 V at pH 7. The observed enhancements strongly tie in with the intermetallic charge transfer (IMCT) intensity between Fe and Co sites. Density Functional Theory simulations suggest that tuning the IMCT can lead to a change of the OER mechanism to an external stimuli&#8208;sensitive spin crossover&#8208;based pathway, which opens the way for switchable electrocatalytic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Imaging of Nascent DNA in Live Cells by Monitoring the Fluorescence Lifetime of DNA&#8208;Incorporated Thiazole Orange&#8208;Modified Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modified 2'&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate derivative (dCTOTP) bearing thiazole orange moiety tethered via an oligoethylene glycol linker was designed and synthesized. The nucleotide was found to incorporate into DNA by DNA polymerases in vitro as well as in live cells. Upon incorporation of dCTOTP into DNA, the thiazole orange moiety exhibited a fluorescence lifetime that differed significantly from the non&#8208;incorporated (i.e. free and non&#8208;covalently intercalated) forms of dCTOTP. When dCTOTP was delivered into live U&#8208;2 OS cells using a synthetic nucleoside triphosphate transporter, it allowed us to distinguish and monitor in real time the cells that were actively synthesizing DNA from the very first moments after treatment. We anticipate that this probe can be used to study chromatin organization and dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Vesicle Signal Transduction Using a Photo&#8208;Responsive Zinc Ionophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transmission of chemical information between cells and across lipid bilayer membranes is of profound significance in many biological processes. The design of synthetic signaling systems is a critical step towards preparing artificial cells with collective behaviour. Here, we report the first example of a synthetic inter&#8208;vesicle signaling system, in which diffusible chemical signals trigger transmembrane ion transport in a manner reminiscent of signaling pathways in biology. The system is derived from novel ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl and BODIPY photo&#8208;caged Zn(II) transporters, in which cation transport is triggered by photo&#8208;decaging with UV or red light, respectively. This decaging reaction can be used to trigger the release of the cationophores from a small population of sender vesicles. This in turn triggers the transport of ions across the membrane of a larger population of receiver vesicles, but not across the sender vesicle membrane, leading to overall inter&#8208;vesicle signal transduction and amplification.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Manufacturing of Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystal Elastomers by Stress&#8208;Induced Alignment and Hydrogen Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid elastomers (LCEs) capable of performing large and reversible deformation in response to an external stimulus are an important class of soft actuators. However, their manufacturing process typically undergoes a multistep approach that requires harsh conditions. For the very first time, LCEs with customized geometries that can be manufactured via a rapid one&#8208;step approach at room temperature are developed. The LCEs are hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) crosslinked main chain polymers comprising flexible short side chains. Applying a stretching/shear force to the LCE can simultaneously induce mesogen alignment and H&#8208;bond exchange, allowing for the formation of well&#8208;aligned LCE network stabilized by H&#8208;bonds. Based on this working principle, soft actuators in fibers and 2D/3D objects can be manufactured via mechanical stretching or melt extrusion within a short time (e.g., &lt; 1 min). These actuators can perform reversible macroscopic motions with large, controlled deformations up to 38%. The dynamic nature of H&#8208;bonds also provides the actuators with reprocessability and reprogrammability. Thus, this work opens the way for the one&#8208;step and custom manufacturing of soft actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Ozone Decomposition over Water&#8208;activated Monolithic MoO3/Graphdiyne Nanowalls under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic ozone (O3) decomposition at high relative humidity (RH) remains a great challenge due to the catalysts poison and deactivation under high humidity. Here, we firstly elaborate the role of water activation and the corresponding mechanism of the promoted O3 decomposition over the three&#8208;dimensional monolithic molybdenum oxide/graphdiyne (MoO3/GDY) catalyst. The O3 decomposition over MoO3/GDY reaches up to 100% under high humid condition (75% RH) at room temperature, which is 4.0 times as high as that of dry conditions, significantly surpasses other carbon&#8208;based MoO3 materials(&#8804; 7.1%). The sp&#8208;hybridized carbon in GDY donates electrons to MoO3 along the C&#8208;O&#8208;Mo bond, facilitating water activation to form hydroxyl species. As a result, hydroxyl species dissociated from water act as new active sites, promoting the adsorption of O3 and the generation of new intermediate species (hydroxyl &#8901;OH and superoxo &#8901;O2&#8722;), which significantly lowers the energy barriers of O3 decomposition (0.57 eV lower than dry conditions).</dc:description>

         <title>Gradually Tuning the Flexibility of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks via Stepwise Structural Transformation and Their Flexibility&#8208;Dependent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are intriguing for their dynamic properties distinctive from rigid counterparts but still suffer from limited accessibility. Especially, controlling flexibility of COFs is challenging and the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs has rarely been unveiled. This article reports stepwise adjustment on flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional COFs, which is realized by the designed synthesis of rigid COF (R&#8208;COF), semi&#8208;flexible COF (SF&#8208;COF), and flexible COF (F&#8208;COF) through polymerization, linker exchange, and linkage conversion with a newly developed method for reduction of hydrazone, respectively. Significant difference in breathing behavior and self&#8208;adaptive capability of the three COFs are uncovered through vapor response and iodine capture experiments. Gas sorption experiments indicate that the porosity of F&#8208;COF could switch from "close" state in nitrogen to "open" state in carbon dioxide, which are not observed for R&#8208;COF and SF&#8208;COF. This study not only develops a strategy to adjust the flexibility of COFs by tuning their linkers and linkages, but also provides a deep insight into the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs, which lays a foundation for the development of this new class of dynamic porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Liposomal Enzyme Nanoreactors based on Nanoconfinement for Efficient Anti&#8208;Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumor and produce cytotoxic species, therefore are promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature that enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposome. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of intermediate product H2O2 as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H2O2 and acidity accelerate the second&#8208;step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in anti&#8208;tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered a potential alternative to high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high reactivity of metallic sodium towards common liquid organic electrolytes renders such battery technology particularly challenging. Herein, we propose a multi&#8208;block single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) doped with ethylene carbonate as suitable electrolyte system for SMBs. This novel SIPE provides a very high ionic conductivity (2.6 mS cm&#8208;1) and an electrochemical stability window of about 4.1 V at 40 &#176;C, enabling stable sodium stripping and plating and excellent rate capability of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells up to 2C. Remarkably, such cells provide a capacity retention of about 85% after 1,000 cycles at 0.2C thanks to the very high Coulombic efficiency (99.9%), resulting from an excellent interfacial stability towards sodium metal and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Zweifel Olefination and its Mechanistic Dichotomy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective Zweifel olefination using boronate complexes carrying two different reactive &#960;&#8208;systems was achieved to synthesize vinyl heteroarenes and conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes in good yield and up to 100% stereoselectivity, which remains unexplored until now. Most importantly, we report the unprecedented formation of E vs. Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes for different heteroarenes under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) investigations unveil the mechanistic dichotomy between olefin and heteroarene activation followed by 1,2&#8208;migration, leading to E or Z&#8208;vinyl heteroarenes respectively. We also report a previously unknown reversal of stereoselectivity by using 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) as an electrophile. The Zweifel olefination using a boronate complex that carries two different olefins was previously unexplored due to significant challenges associated with the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins. We have solved this problem and reported the site&#8208;selective activation of olefins for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing F/P Hybrid Polymer as Ultrastable Cationic Shielding&#160;Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendrite growth on electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase has severely limited applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we developed an ionic alternating polymer with fluorocarbons and phosphonium cations in repeating units to regulate Li deposition for the first time. The combined functionalities in the F/P hybrid polymer exhibit remarkable characteristics as a protective layer on top of Li anode, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical stability, ion flux redistributing capability and adaptive chain mobility. Based on characterizations and simulations, this cationic interlayer could effectively furnish long&#8208;standing electrostatic shielding for anodes, allowing restrained coating decomposition and homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, and enabling full cells with enhanced rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Given the importance of LMBs, this work will promote polymer design to stabilize anodes with superior electrochemical behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H Amidation for the Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo&#8208;protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2&#8208;diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents. It was found applicable to both &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, for which a two&#8208;step protocol involving intermolecular olefin hydroamination and C(sp3)&#8211;H amidation was developed. Kinetic and computational studies provided insights into the observed reactivity difference between pairs of diastereoisomeric substrates.</dc:description>
