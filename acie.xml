      <title>Macrocyclic Dinuclear Palladium Complex as Novel Doubly Threaded [3]Rotaxane Scaffold and its Application to Rotaxane Cross&#8208;linker</title>
      <dc:description>A dinuclear Pd(II) complex possessing a cyclic ligand was developed as a novel doubly threaded [3]rotaxane scaffold and applied to a rotaxane cross&#8208;linker reagent. The dinuclear complex&#160;(PdMC)2&#160;was prepared by one&#8208;step macrocyclization followed by double palladation reactions.&#160;1H NMR and UV&#8211;vis measurements revealed the formation of a doubly threaded pseudo[3]rotaxane by the complexation of&#160;(PdMC)2&#160;with 2 eq. of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridine&#160;3&#160;through double metal coordination. The treatment of&#160;(PdMC)2&#160;with 2 eq. of 4&#8208;vinylpyridine (VP) afforded a doubly threaded [3]rotaxane cross&#8208;linker&#160;(PdMC&#8208;VP)2. Radical co&#8208;polymerization of VP and&#160;t&#8208;butylstyrene in the presence of&#160;(PdMC&#8208;VP)2&#160;afforded a stable rotaxane cross&#8208;linked polymer (RCP). An elastic RCP was also prepared using&#160;n&#8208;butyl acrylate as a monomer.

      <title>Composition&#8208;Tunable Antiperovskite CuxIn1&#8208;xNNi3 as Superior Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a group of newly reported antiperovskite nitrides Cu  x  In  1&#8208;  x  NNi  3  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with tunable composition are employed as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Cu  0.4  In  0.6  NNi  3  shows the highest&#8208;intrinsic performance of the developed catalysts in this work with a merely 42 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  . High current density stability test at 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  shows its super&#8208;stable performance with only 7 mV increasing on the overpotential after more than 60&#8208;hour measurement, which surpass that of the commercial Pt/C (increase 170 mV). By partial substitution, the derived antiperovskite nitride achieves a smaller kinetic barrier of water dissociation compared to the unsubstituted InNNi  3  and CuNNi  3  , revealed by first&#8208;principle calculations. It is found that the partially substituted Cu  x  In  1&#8208;x  NNi  3  suggests a thermal neutral and desirable Gibbs free energy of hydrogen for HER. This enhancement is assumed to the tailoring of the energy of d&#8208;band center arose by the A&#8208;site (A = Cu or In) substitution, which optimizes the interaction between the antiperovskite nitride and the adsorbates. This work ushers in an effective strategy for optimizing the electrocatalytic activity of antiperovskite nitrides by tuning their composition.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Carboxylates</title>
      <dc:description>Carboxylate esters have many desirable features as electrophiles for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling: they are easy to access, robust during multistep synthesis, and mass efficient in coupling reactions. Alkenyl carboxylates, a class of readily prepared non&#8208;aromatic electrophiles, remain difficult to functionalize via cross&#8208;coupling. We demonstrate that Pd catalysis is effective for coupling electron&#8208;deficient alkenyl carboxylates with arylboronic acids in the absence of base or oxidants. Furthermore, these reactions can proceed by two distinct mechanisms for C&#8211;O bond activation. A Pd(0)/(II) catalytic cycle is viable when using a Pd(0) precatalyst, with turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8211;O oxidative addition; however, an alternative pathway that involves alkene carbopalladation and &#946;&#8208;carboxyl elimination is proposed for Pd(II) precatalysts. This work provides a clear path toward engaging myriad oxygen&#8208;based electrophiles in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring Poly(ether sulfone) Bipolar Membrane for Osmotic Energy Generator with High Power Density</title>
      <dc:description>Osmotic energy, obtained through different concentration of salt solutions, is recognized as a kind of sustainable energy source because few pollutants are discharged during electricity generation process. Lately, asymmetric aromatic compound membranes have attracted worldwide concern thanks to their low cost and high performance in osmotic energy conversion. However, the membrane formation process,  forms of  functional groups, membrane thickness and the dimensional change could also be the interfering factors of power generation performance.

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part C. Toward Consilience</title>
      <dc:description>
In the last part of our Essay, we outline a path of consilience, with a role both for simulation and for understanding. Experiment draws us together. Two case studies show what brings joy, and make it clear that how intertwined computation and theory&#8208;building has been for the authors. In the conjoined future we imagine (far out for some) chemistry's streak of creation provides a link to Art, and a passage to a renewed vision of the sacred in science.







Abstract
In the last part of our Essay, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and for searchers for understanding. We begin by looking at theory and simulation, surrounded as they are by and interacting with experiment, especially in Chemistry. Experimenters ask questions both conceptual and numerical, and so draw the communities together. Two case studies show what brings the theoretician authors joy in this playground, and two more detailed ones make it clear that computation/simulation is anyway deeply intertwined with theory&#8208;building in what we do, or for that matter, anywhere in the profession. From a definition of science we try to foresee how simulation and theory will interact in the AI&#8208;dominated future. We posit that Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a link to Art, and a passage to a renewed vision of the sacred in science.

      <title>Enantiodivergent cyclization by inversion of the reactivity in ambiphilic molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Inverting the reactivity of the functional groups in ambiphilic molecules provides a new synthetic strategy to carry out late&#8208;stage enantiodivergence. Both enantiomers of the final compound can be obtained from a common chiral precursor. As a proof of concept, the synthesis of substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered oxacycles is described. The key step is the cyclization of an ambiphilic linear precursor bearing a propargylic alcohol and an epoxide linked through an alkyl chain. Through a slight modification of these linear precursors and employing different reaction conditions, these functional groups can inverse their chemical reactivity, producing one enantiomer or another of the final product. This enantiodivergent cyclization involves three stereogenic centers that can undergo fully controlled retention or inversion of their configuration depending on the cyclization pathway that is activated. The cyclization provides late&#8208;stage enantiodivergence, enabling the synthesis of either enantiomers of the oxacycles from a common chiral substrate with total transfer of the enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

      <title>Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Triarylboranes: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <dc:description>Achieving highly efficient phosphorescence in purely organic luminophors at room temperature remains a major challenge due to slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates in combination with effective non&#8208;radiative processes in those systems. Most room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) organic materials have O&#8208; or N&#8208;lone pairs leading to low lying (n, &#960;*) and (&#960;, &#960;*) excited states which accelerate  k  isc  through El&#8208;Sayed&#8217;s rule. Herein, we report the first persistent RTP with lifetimes up to 0.5 s from simple triarylboranes which have no lone pairs. RTP is only observed in the crystalline state and in highly doped PMMA films which are indicative of aggregation induced emission (AIE). Detailed crystal structure analysis suggested that intermolecular interactions are important for efficient RTP. Furthermore, photophysical studies of the isolated molecules in a frozen glass, in combination with DFT/MRCI calculations, show that (&#963;, B p)&#8594;(&#960;, B p) transitions accelerate the ISC process. This work provides a new approach for the design of RTP materials without (n, &#960;*) transitions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Arrangement of polymer&#8208;chains dictates the bulk properties of polymers and there is great interest in methodologies for aligning polymer chains in desired topologies. To synthesize a 1D polymer in a novel twist&#8208;stacked topology, we designed a peptide&#8208;monomer HC&#8801;CCH  2  &#8208;NH&#8208;Ile&#8208;Leu&#8208;N  3,  which crystallizes in P6  5  space group with its molecules H&#8208;bonded along a six&#8208;fold screw axis. These H&#8208;bonded columns pack parallelly such that molecules arrange head&#8208;to&#8208;tail forming linear non&#8208;covalent chains in planes perpendicular to the screw axis. These chains arrange parallelly to form molecular layers, which twist&#8208;stack along the screw axis. Crystals of this monomer, on heating, undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) Topochemical Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization to yield exclusively 1,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymer in a twist&#8208;stacked layered topology.

Key to the success for this process is the use of a specific sterically demanding phosphine ligand based on N  &#8208;arylated imidazole ( L11  ) in the presence of Pd(MeCN) 2  Cl 2  as pre&#8208;catalyst. A variety of easily available alkynols provide under additive&#8208;free conditions the corresponding &#945;  &#8208;methylene&#8208; &#946;  &#8208;lactones in moderate to good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first general and regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclocarbonylation to give &#945;  &#8208;methylene&#8208; &#946;  &#8208;lactones is reported. Key to the success for this process is the use of a specific sterically demanding phosphine ligand based on N  &#8208;arylated imidazole ( L11  ) in the presence of Pd(MeCN) 2  Cl 2  as pre&#8208;catalyst. A variety of easily available alkynols provide under additive&#8208;free conditions the corresponding &#945;  &#8208;methylene&#8208; &#946;  &#8208;lactones in moderate to good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The applicability of this novel methodology is showcased by the direct carbonylation of biologically active molecules including natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Imide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an extensively studied class of porous materials, which distinguish themselves from other porous polymers in their crystallinity and high degree of modularity, enabling a wide range of applications. COFs are most commonly synthesized solvothermally, which is often a time consuming process and restricted to well soluble precursor molecules. Synthesis of polyimide&#8208;linked COFs (PI&#8208;COFs) is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the ring closing reaction under solvothermal conditions. Herein, we report the ionothermal synthesis of crystalline and porous PI&#8208;COFs in zinc chloride and eutectic salt mixtures. This synthesis does not require soluble precursors and the reaction time is significantly reduced as compared to standard solvothermal synthesis methods. In addition to applying the synthesis to previously reported imide COFs, a new perylene based COF was also synthesized, which could not be obtained by using the classical solvothermal route. In situ high temperature XRPD analysis hints to the formation of precursor&#8208;salt adducts as crystalline intermediates, which then react with each other to form the COF.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity of the Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate: Triggerable C&#8208;C Bond Formation and Rate Control in Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity (MLC) had a remarkable impact on transition metal chemistry and catalysis. By use of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate, [1]  &#8208;  , which features a square&#8208;planar Al(III), we transfer this concept into the p&#8208;block and fully elucidate its mechanisms by experiment and theory. Complementary to transition metal&#8208;based MLC (aromatization upon substrate binding), substrate binding in [1]  &#8208;  occurs by dearomatization of the ligand. The aluminate trapps carbonyls by the formation of C&#8208;C and Al&#8208;O bonds, but the products maintain full reversibility and outstanding dynamic exchange rates. Remarkably, the C&#8208;C bonds can be formed or cleaved by the addition or removal of lithium cations, permitting unprecedented control over the system's constitutional state. Moreover, the metal&#8208;ligand cooperative substrate interaction allows to twist the kinetics of catalytic hydroboration reactions in a unique sense. Ultimately, this work describes the evolution of an anti&#8208;van't Hoff/Le Bel species from their being as a structural curiosity to their application as a reagent and catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging to Reveal Mitochondrial Nucleoprotein Dynamics with Reactive Oxygen Species Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the biomolecular interactions in a specific organelle has been a long&#8208;standing challenge because it requires super&#8208;resolution imaging to resolve the spatial locations and dynamic interactions of multiple biomacromolecules. Two key difficulties, however, are that molecular probes suitable for super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy are rather rare, and more adversely the use of multiple probes complicates their cellular uptakes, biodistributions, and spectral distinctions. Here, we report a quinolinium derivative probe that is selectively enriched in mitochondria, and switches on in three different fluorescence modes in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), protein, and nucleic acid, enabling the visualization of mitochondrial nucleoprotein dynamics. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy reveals that the proteins localize at mitochondrial cristae and largely fuse with nucleic acids to form nucleoproteins, whereas increasing H2O2 level leads to disassociation of nucleic acid&#8208;protein complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Why Boron Nitride is such a Selective Catalyst for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, boron&#8208;containing materials and in particular boron nitride, have been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes such as propane. Until now, no mechanism exists that can explain both the unprecedented selectivity, the observed surface oxyfunctionalization, as well as the peculiar kinetic features of the reaction.&#160;&#160;In this contribution we combine catalytic activity measurements with quantum chemical calculations to put forward a bold new hypothesis. Based on our results, we argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface&#8208;mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase. Based on known radical propagation steps, we quantitatively describe the oxygen pressure&#8208;dependent relative formation of the main product propylene and by&#8208;product ethylene. The free radical intermediates are most likely what differentiates this catalytic system from less selective vanadium&#8208;based catalysts. Indeed, although the mechanism of this benchmark catalyst is also not yet unambiguously established, it is generally assumed that radical intermediates are rapidly converted to stable molecular products on the catalyst surface before they can desorb. The new insights obtained in this work highlight the importance of the mechanistic differences between these two catalyst families which could lead to better design principles and improved catalytic systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic features of transition states for &#946;&#8208;scission reactions of alkenes over acid zeolites revealed by AIMD simulations</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolite&#8208;catalyzed alkene cracking is key to optimize the size of hydrocarbons. The nature and stability of intermediates and transition states (TS) are, however, still debated. Herein, transition path sampling and blue moon ensemble density functional theory simulations are combined to unravel the behavior of C7 alkenes in CHA zeolite.

      <dc:description>Understanding the thermal aggregation behaviors of metal atoms is of significant importance for precise synthesis of supported metal clusters.

      <title>A High Performing Zn&#8208;ion Battery Cathode Enabled by in&#8208;situ Transformation of V2O5 Atomic Layers</title>
      <dc:description>Developing high capacity and stable cathodes is a key to successful commercialization of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Pure layered V  2  O  5  has a high theoretical capacity (585 mAh/g), but it suffers severe capacity decay. Pre&#8208;inserting cations into V  2  O  5  can substantially stabilize the performance, but at an expense of lowered capacity. Here we show that an atomic layer deposition derived V  2  O  5  can be an excellent ZIB cathode with high capacity and exceptional cycle stability at once. We report for the first time a rapid  in&#8208;situ  on&#8208;site transformation of V  2  O  5  atomic layers into Zn  3  V  2  O  7  (OH)  2  &#8901;2H  2  O (ZVO) nanoflake clusters, also a known Zn&#8208;ion and proton intercalatable material. The extraordinary electrochemical performance arises from the unique attributes of the ALD&#8208;V  2  O  5  : high concentration of reactive sites, strong bonding to the conductive substrate, nanosized thickness and binder&#8208;free composition, all of which facilitate ionic transport and promote the best utilization of the active material. We also provide new insights into the V  2  O  5  &#8208;dissolution mechanisms for different Zn&#8208;salt aqueous electrolytes and their implications to the cycle stability.

      <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Conversion of a Paramagnetic FeCo Complex into a Molecular Magnetic Switch with Tuneable Hysteresis</title>
      <dc:description>A key challenge in the design of magnetic molecular switches is to obtain bistability at room temperature. Here, we show that a moderate pressure allows converting a paramagnetic Fe  III  2  Co  II  2  square complex into a molecular switch exhibiting a full dia&#8208; to para&#8208;magnetic transition: Fe  II  Co  III  &#11012; Fe  III  Co  II  . Moreover, the complex follows a rare behavior: the higher the pressure is, the broader the magnetic hysteresis is. Thus, the application of an adequate pressure allows inducing a magnetic bi&#8208;stability at room temperature with predictable hysteresis width. The structural studies at different pressures suggest that the pressure&#8208;enhanced bi&#8208;stability is due to the strengthening of intermolecular interactions upon pressure increase. An original microscopic Ising&#8208;like model including pressure effects, is developed to simulate this unprecedented behavior. Overall, this study shows that FeCo complexes could be very sensitive piezo&#8208;switches with potential use as sensors.</dc:description>

Hihath, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002300). By using separate electrically&#8208;controllable reactions for the forward and reverse reactions the bistable norbornadiene&#8211;quadricyclane system can be set in either state. The device can be switched through multiple cycles when a square&#8208;wave voltage signal is applied to the molecule. Each state has a unique conductance value allowing the system to act as a switch or memory device.&#160;

Escaping from the planar geometry of trivalent boron Lewis acids is possible by incorporating a boron atom at the edge of the triptycene scaffold. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003119), G. Berionni and co&#8208;workers describe the preparation of the elusive 9&#8208;boratriptycene, a triarylborane with unprecedented structure and high Lewis acidity, due to the very low reorganization energy of the triptycene core and the absence of conjugation of its B atom orbitals with the orthogonally oriented aryl rings.

Just like a horse capturing a pawn to win the position at a chess game, nitrogen&#8208;centered radical selectivity for hydrogen atom abstraction allows for a novel directed aliphatic C&#8722;H fluorination methodology. As described by D. Bafaluy, Z. Georgieva, and K. Mu&#241;iz in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202004902), the unique and outstanding performance of halogen catalysis enables the use of simple fluoride as fluorine source in a homogeneous approach to 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;fluoroamines.

Surfactant&#8208;directed functionalization is a promising tool for enabling targeted modification of two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials and open up a whole new spectrum of exciting chemistry to be explored. As demonstrated by C.

      <title>Highly Selective Removal of Perfluorinated Contaminants by Adsorption on All&#8208;Silica Zeolite Beta</title>
      <dc:description>
Perfluorinated compounds have found wide applications but have adverse effects on health and environment. There is a need to selectively recover them from process and surface waters. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002953), D.&#8197;E. De&#8197;Vos et&#8197;al. show that a microporous zeolite Beta, in its all&#8208;silica form, shows outstanding capacity and affinity for the uptake of PFCs like perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, even in the presence of other organics.

      <title>Infrared Spectrum of the Adamantane+&#8211;Water Cation: Hydration&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Free Internal Water Rotation</title>
      <dc:description>
C&#8722;H bond activation of the Jahn&#8211;Teller distorted adamantane cation by a single H2O molecule is probed by IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations in the Research Article by O. Dopfer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003637). The results provide a quantitative molecular level understanding of the initial activation by a single polar solvent molecule in the radical cation mechanism for functionalization of diamondoids. A drastic C&#8722;H stretch frequency shift along with quasi&#8208;free internal rotation of the H2O ligand is observed.

      <title>Keteniminium&#8208;Driven Umpolung Difunctionalization of Ynamides</title>
      <dc:description>
Trapped: A nondirected keteniminium&#8208;driven multicomponent 1,2&#8208;umpolung difunctionalization of ynamides with aryl diazonium salts and aryl boronic acids under Pd catalysis for the synthesis of triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is showcased for the first time. This transformation proceeds by 1,3&#8208;migration of an electrophile from in situ generated keteniminium species to the electrophilic &#945;&#8208;position of the ynamide, followed by trapping of nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;vinylic metal species with a nucleophile.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling of ynamides, aryl diazonium salts, and aryl boronic acids for the synthesis of novel triaryl&#8208;substituted enamides is described. This transformation represents the first example of an umpolung regioselective unsymmetrical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylation/aryl&#8208;olefination of ynamides. The aryl moieties of the diazonium salt (electrophile) and boronic acid (nucleophile) are explicitly incorporated in the electrophilic &#945;&#8208; and nucleophilic &#946;&#8208;position, respectively, of the ynamide, resulting in a single isomer of the N&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted olefin. The scope is broad (68 examples), showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. DFT calculations substantiate the rationale of the mechanistic cycle and the regioselectivity. The chemoselectivity and synthetic potential of the enamide products were also studied.

      <dc:description>The ability to precisely measure and monitor temperature at high resolution at the nanoscale is an important task for better understanding the thermodynamic properties of functional entities at the nanoscale in complex systems, or at the level of a single cell. However, the development of high&#8208;resolution and robust thermal nano&#8208;sensors is challenging. Here we describe the design, assembly and characterization of a group of thermal&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;joints which consist of two interlocked double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) rings. The described DNA nano&#8208;joint can reversibly switch between the static and mobile state at different temperatures without a special annealing process. The temperature response range of the DNA nano&#8208;joint can be easily tuned by changing the length or the sequence of the hybridized region in its structure, and due to its interlocked structure, the temperature response range of the DNA nano&#8208;joint is largely unaffected by its own concentration, which is different from systems that consist of separated components.</dc:description>

      <title>Hypoxia&#8208;instructed pro&#8208;protein therapy assisted with self&#8208;catalyzed nanozymogen</title>
      <dc:description>The success of intracellular protein therapy demands potent intracellular delivery efficiency and selective protein activity in diseased cells. To fulfil these requirements, a cascaded nanozymogen incorporating hypoxia&#8208;instructed pro&#8208;protein engineering and hypoxia&#8208;strengthened intracellular protein delivery was developed. RPAB, a pro&#8208;protein of RNase A reversibly caged with hypoxia&#8208;cleavable azobenzene yet deprived of the enzymatic activity, was designed and co&#8208;delivered with glucose oxidase (GOx) using hypoxia&#8208;dissociable nanocomplexes (NCs) consisting of azobenzene&#8208;cross&#8208;linked oligoethylenimine (AOEI) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Upon NCs&#8208;mediated tumor targeting, cancer cell internalization, and endolysosomal escape, GOx catalyzed intracellular glucose decomposition and aggravated tumoral hypoxia, which drove the recovery of RPAB back to the hydrolytically active RNase and concurrently expedited the degradation of AOEI to release more protein cargoes. Thus, the catalytic reaction of the nanozymogen was self&#8208;accelerated and self&#8208;cycled, ultimately leading to cooperative anti&#8208;cancer efficacies between GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy and RNase&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;apoptotic therapy. This study represents the first example of hypoxia&#8208;instructed pro&#8208;protein engineering, which expands the available chemical tools for the conditional control over protein functions. The self&#8208;catalyzed nanozymogen design also provides an effective strategy to mediate intracellular protein delivery and highly sensitive and selective intracellular pro&#8208;protein activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Concentrated Electrolyte towards Enhanced Energy Density and Cycling Life of Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have attracted much attention owing to their low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;voltage, and environmental friendliness. As the source of active ions during the charging/discharging process, the electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of DIBs, including capacity, energy density, and cycling life. However, most used electrolyte systems based on the LiPF  6  salt shows unsatisfied performance in DIBs. In this work, we successfully developed a 7.5 m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in carbonate electrolyte system. Compared with diluted electrolytes, this highly concentrated electrolyte exhibits several advantages: (1) enhanced intercalation capacity and cycling stability of graphite cathode; (2) optimized structural stability of Al anode; (3) significantly increased battery energy density. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept DIB based on this concentrated electrolyte exhibits a discharge capacity of 94.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 200 mA g  &#8208;1  and 96.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. By counting both the electrode materials and electrolyte, the energy density of this pro&#8208;type DIB reaches up to ~180 Wh kg  &#8208;1  , which is among the best performance of previously reported DIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Two Pyrophosphates with Large Birefringences and Second&#8208;Harmonic Responses as Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Two new pyrophosphates nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, Rb3PbBi(P2O7)2 (I) and Cs3PbBi(P2O7)2 (II), were successfully designed and synthesized. Both compounds exhibit large nonlinear optical (NLO) effects and birefringences. Especially, I presents the scarce case of possessing the coexistence of large birefringence (0.031 at 1064 nm and 0.037 at 532 nm) and second harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.8 &#215; KDP) in ultraviolet (UV) NLO phosphates and breaks through the zero pyrophosphates with large SHG (&gt;2 &#215; KDP). Both I and II have three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystal structures composed of corner&#8208;shared RbO12 (CsO11), RbO10 (CsO10), BiO6, PbO7 (PbO6) and P2O7 groups, in which P2O7 and PbO7 (PbO6) units form alveolate [PbPO]&#8734; skeleton frame. Theoretical calculations reveal that the P&#8208;O and Bi&#8208;O units are mainly responsible for the birefringence, while P&#8208;O and Pb&#8208;O groups are essential for large SHG efficiency for I.</dc:description>

      <title>The mineral/water interface probed with nonlinear optical spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The interaction between minerals and water is relevant for a wide range of geological, atmospheric, environmental, and electro(photo&#8208;)chemical systems. This interaction is manifold and complex: the mineral surface can be (de&#8208;)protonated by water, thereby changing its charge, and thus the interaction with water; mineral ions dissolved into the aqueous phase screen the surface charges, also modifying the water interaction. Intrinsically molecular&#8208;level processes and interactions thus govern macroscopic phenomena such as flow&#8208;induced dissolution, wetting, and charging. This realization is increasingly prompting molecular&#8208;level studies of mineral&#8208;water interfaces. Here, we review recent developments in second&#8208;order nonlinear spectroscopy techniques like Sum Frequency and Second Harmonic Generation (SFG/SHG), which can provide information about the molecular arrangement of the first few layers of water molecules directly at the mineral surface. The results illustrate the subtleties of both chemical and physical interactions between water and the mineral and the critical role of mineral dissolution and other ions in solution for determining those interactions.

      <title>An RCM&#8208;Based Total Synthesis of the Antibiotic Disciformycin B</title>
      <dc:description>The total synthesis of the potent new antibiotic disciformycin B (2) is described, which shows significant activity against methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/VRSA) strains. The synthetic route is based on macrocyclization of a tetraene substrate to the 12&#8208;membered macrolactone core by ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis (RCM). Although macrocyclization was accompanied by concomitant cyclopentene formation by an alternative RCM pathway, conditions could eventually be established that gave the macrocycle as the major product. Key steps in the construction of the RCM&#8208;substrate included a highly efficient Evans syn&#8208;aldol reaction, the asymmetric Brown allylation of angelic aldehyde and the stereoselective Zn(BH4)2&#8208;mediated 1,2&#8208;reduction of an enone. The synthesis was completed by late&#8208;stage dehydrative glycosylation to introduce the D&#8208;arabinofuranosyl moiety and final chemoselective allylic alcohol oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Template&#8208;directed copying of RNA by non&#8208;enzymatic ligation</title>
      <dc:description>The non&#8208;enzymatic replication of the primordial genetic material is thought to have enabled the evolution of early forms of RNA&#8208;based life. However, the replication of oligonucleotides long enough to encode catalytic functions is problematic due to the low efficiency of template copying with mononucleotides. Here we show that template&#8208;directed ligation can assemble long RNAs from shorter oligonucleotides, which would be easier to replicate. The rate of ligation can be greatly enhanced by employing a 3&#697;&#8208;amino group at the 3&#697;&#8208;end of each oligonucleotide, in combination with an N&#8208;alkyl imidazole organocatalyst. These modifications enable the copying of RNA templates by the multi&#8208;step ligation of tetranucleotide building blocks, as well as the assembly of long oligonucleotides using short splint oligonucleotides. We also demonstrate the formation of long oligonucleotides inside model prebiotic vesicles, suggesting a potential route to the assembly of artificial cells capable of evolution.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The non&#8208;enzymatic replication of the primordial genetic material is thought to have enabled the evolution of early forms of RNA&#8208;based life. However, the replication of oligonucleotides long enough to encode catalytic functions is problematic due to the low efficiency of template copying with mononucleotides. Here we show that template&#8208;directed ligation can assemble long RNAs from shorter oligonucleotides, which would be easier to replicate. The rate of ligation can be greatly enhanced by employing a 3&#697;&#8208;amino group at the 3&#697;&#8208;end of each oligonucleotide, in combination with an N&#8208;alkyl imidazole organocatalyst. These modifications enable the copying of RNA templates by the multi&#8208;step ligation of tetranucleotide building blocks, as well as the assembly of long oligonucleotides using short splint oligonucleotides. We also demonstrate the formation of long oligonucleotides inside model prebiotic vesicles, suggesting a potential route to the assembly of artificial cells capable of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H activation was achieved with excellent selectivity under mild conditions and inquisitively 30 mol% of NaF additive was found to be crucial for the efficient dienylation. The methodology features high stereoselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance. C&#8208;8 Alkenylation of quinoline&#8208;  N  &#8208;oxides was achieved in case of allenes devoid of leaving groups as coupling partners.

      <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite Y via a Combined Strategy of In Situ Hydroxyl Radical Assistance and Post&#8208;Synthesis Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolite Y with high SiO  2  /Al  2  O  3  ratio (SAR) plays an important role in fluidized catalytic cracking process. However, in situ synthesis of zeolite Y with high SAR remains challenges due to kinetic limitations. Herein, zeolite Y with SAR of 6.35 was first synthesized via a hydroxyl radical&#8208;assisted route coupled with post&#8208;synthesis treatment, where hydrogen peroxide was used as the initiator of hydroxyl radicals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that hydroxyl radicals preferentially enhanced the formation of Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonds, thus leading to an increased SAR. To further increase SAR, a dealumination process was carried out by citric acid followed by second&#8208;step hydrothermal crystallization, giving SAR up to 7.5 while maintaining good crystallinity and high product yield. The resultant zeolite Y showed superior performance in cumene cracking. This work introduces a new strategy for synthesizing high SAR zeolite Y that is heavily used in commercial applications.</dc:description>

This process utilizes various commercially available carbamates and sulfonamides to generate allenylic amines including commonly employed protected groups (Boc, Fmoc, Cbz, Ts, Ns) in 62&#8208;82% yield and 87&#8208;98% ee. The products generated via this scalable procedure serve as effective linchpins for the rapid, enantiospecific synthesis of a wide range of complex structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling Through Crossing Potential Energy Surfaces: Cyclization of a Triplet 2&#8208;Formylarylnitrene to a Singlet 2,1&#8208;Benzisoxazole</title>
      <dc:description>Not long ago, the occurrence of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) chemistry involving atoms heavier than hydrogen was considered unreasonable. Contributing to the shift of this paradigm, we present here the discovery of a new and distinct heavy&#8208;atom QMT reaction. Triplet  syn  &#8208;2&#8208;formyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluorophenylnitrene, generated in argon matrices by UV&#8208;irradiation of an azide precursor, was found to spontaneously cyclize to singlet 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole. Monitoring the transformation by IR spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;independent rate constants (  k  ~1.4 &#215; 10  &#8722;3  s  &#8722;1  ; half&#8208;life of ~8 min) were measured from 10 to 20 K. Computations estimate rate constants in fair agreement with experimental values, providing evidence for a mechanism involving heavy&#8208;atom QMT through crossing triplet to singlet potential energy surfaces. Moreover, the heavy&#8208;atom QMT takes place with considerable displacement of the oxygen atom, which establishes a new limit for the heavier atom involved in a QMT reaction in cryogenic matrices.</dc:description>

      <title>Graphdiyne:A New Structure of Fluorescent Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) as an emerging two&#8208;dimensional carbon allotrope exhibits excellent performance in energy chemistry, catalytic chemistry, optoelectronics, electronics, etc. due to the unique structure combines sp&#8208; and sp2 hybrid carbon network. However, the poor solubility of pristine GDY is the major obstacle to its applications in many fields. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to control the preparation of graphdiyne quantum dots (GDY&#8208;Py QDs), in which pyrene groups are covalently linked to GDY by Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The as&#8208;prepared GDY&#8208;Py QDs with average diameter of about 3 &#177; 0.1 nm show superior dispersibility in many organic solvents and water. The GDY&#8208;Py QDs display not only brightly fluorescent with a high relative quantum yield (QY) of 42.82%, but also well&#8208;behaved as contrast agents in cell&#8208;imaging. The GDY&#8208;Py QDs are bestowed with high stability and non&#8208;cytotoxicity and exhibit long fluorescent time, which could offer great potential in optical imaging and biomedical application.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermarriage of Halide Perovskites and Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>This review examines the intermarriage of perovskite and metal&#8208;organic framework crystals as bringing new paradigms for material design and functionality. The strategic combination of halide perovskites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals has generated a new family of porous composite materials that will enable new applications including optoelectronic, catalysis, sensing, and data encryption. This review surveys the current progress of this exciting new area. The fundamental aspects, including perovskite nucleation and growth, heterojunction electron&#8208;hole transfer, electronic structure and luminescence within confined spaces, are highlighted, suggesting the approaches by which guest confinement within MOFs can be synthetically designed. We further address the underlying principles and discuss the new insights and tools for the manipulation of these composite materials, pointing the way to the development of synthetic microporous semiconducting composites, as well as new strategies for host&#8208;guest interfacial engineering.</dc:description>

      <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Formation Pathway for CdTeSe Alloy Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Little is known about the pathway of room&#8208;temperature formation of ternary CdTeSe magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) obtained via mixing binary CdTe and CdSe induction period&#160;samples containing binary precursor compounds (PCs) of MSCs, monomers (Ms), and fragments (Fs). Also, unestablished are dispersion effects that occur when as&#8208;mixed samples (without incubation) are placed in toluene (Tol) and octylamine (OTA) mixtures. The resulting ternary MSCs, exhibiting sharp optical absorption peaking at 399 nm, are labelled &#8220;CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399&#8221;, and their particular PCs are &#8220;CdTeSe PC&#8208;399&#8221;. It is shown that when the amount of the primary amine (OTA) was relatively small, single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 evolved without binary CdTe or CdSe MSCs. When the OTA amount was relatively large, CdTe MSC&#8208;371 appeared initially and then disappeared, while single&#8208;ensemble MSC&#8208;399 developed more deliberately. The larger the OTA amount was, the more slowly these changes proceeded. The substitution reaction of CdTe PC + CdSe M/F &#8660; CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdTe M/F is proposed to be rate&#8208;determining for the MSC&#8208;399 formation in a Tol and OTA mixture. The present study provides further understanding regarding the transformation pathway between MSCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Advances in the Interfacial Assembly of Mesoporous Silica on Magnetite Particles</title>
      <dc:description>
Multifaceted materials: Interface assembly enables the integration of magnetic particles and mesoporous materials to form advanced core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous materials for a variety of applications in catalysis, environmental remediation, and biomedicine. This Minireview summarizes progress made in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.







Abstract
Interfacing magnetic particles with ordered mesoporous materials is an effective direction for the development of functional porous composite materials with rationally designed core&#8211;shell structures. Owing to the combined properties of magnetic nanoparticles and mesoporous silica (high surface area, large pore volume, porosity, and biocompatibility), core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica materials have generated tremendous interest in various disciplines, including chemistry, materials, bioengineering, and biomedicine. Interfacial assembly strategies enable the rational construction of magnetic mesoporous silica materials with well&#8208;defined core&#8211;shell structure, morphology, pore parameters, and surface wettability, which can decisively influence their physical and chemical properties and thus improve their application performance. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis of core&#8211;shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.

      <dc:description>
More light in chemistry: This Minireview highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging techniques in theoretical and computational photochemistry. This is a challenging and rapidly evolving field that relates time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy with electronic structure theory and molecular dynamics for electronic excited states.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a fascinating branch of chemistry that is concerned with molecules and light. However, the importance of simulating light&#8208;induced processes is reflected also in fields as diverse as biology, material science, and medicine. This Minireview highlights recent progress achieved in theoretical chemistry to calculate electronically excited states of molecules and simulate their photoinduced dynamics, with the aim of reaching experimental accuracy. We focus on emergent methods and give selected examples that illustrate the progress in recent years towards predicting complex electronic structures with strong correlation, calculations on large molecules, describing multichromophoric systems, and simulating non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics over long time scales, for molecules in the gas phase or in complex biological environments.
