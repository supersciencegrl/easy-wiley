         <title>NBN&#8208;Doped Bis&#8208;Tetracene and Peri&#8208;Tetracene: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel double NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes, bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT), are achieved through a combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis. The chemical structures are clearly characterized by STM and AFM. Moreover, NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT can be further tailored to dications, which demonstrate similar electronic properties to their all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based isoelectronic structures bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene.







Abstract
Combining solution&#8208;based and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis, we demonstrate the first synthesis of NBN&#8208;doped bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT). The chemical structures are clearly elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) characterizations reveal that NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT possess higher energy gaps than bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene. Interestingly, NBN&#8208;BT can undergo stepwise one&#8208;electron oxidation and convert into its corresponding radical cation and then to its dication. The energy gap of the NBN&#8208;BT dication is similar to that of bis&#8208;tetracene, indicating their isoelectronic relationship. Moreover, a similar energy gap between the NBN&#8208;PT dication and peri&#8208;tetracene can be predicted by DFT calculations. This work provides a novel synthesis along with characterizations of multi&#8208;NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged peri&#8208;acenes with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>SmCo5 with a Reconstructed Oxyhydroxide Surface for Spin&#8208;Selective Water Oxidation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarized spins occurring at the ferromagnetic/oxyhydroxide interface of surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy led to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins were aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C (see picture).







Abstract
The efficiency of electrolytic hydrogen production is limited by the slow reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface&#8208;reconstructed ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts with a spin&#8208;pinning effect at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface could enhance the spin&#8208;dependent OER kinetics. However, in real&#8208;life applications, electrolyzers are operated at elevated temperature, which may disrupt the spin orientations of FM catalysts and limit their performance. In this study, we prepared surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy, which possesses polarized spins at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface that lead to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins could be further aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. Moreover, the operation temperature was elevated to mimic the practical operation conditions of water electrolyzers. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Versatile Polymer Nanocapsules via Redox Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse and tunable polymer nanocapsules are synthesized via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules, dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. This streamlined method not only provides functional nanocapsules, but also enables the facile accommodation of functional cores for yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures, expediting the development of multifunctional nanosystems.







Abstract
Polymer nanocapsules have demonstrated significant value in materials science and biomedical technology, but require complicated and time&#8208;consuming synthetic steps. We report here the facile synthesis of monodisperse polymer nanocapsules via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules: dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol (BDT). Specifically, BDT forms core templates and modulates the oxidation kinetics of dopamine into polydopamine (PDA) shells. These uniform nanoparticles can be tuned between &#8776;70 and 200&#8197;nm because the core diameter directly depends on BDT while the shell thickness depends on dopamine. The supramolecular core can then rapidly disassemble in organic solvents to produce PDA nanocapsules. Such nanocapsules exhibit enhanced physicochemical performance (e.g., loading capacity, photothermal transduction, and anti&#8208;oxidation) versus their solid counterparts. Particularly, this method enables a straightforward encapsulation of functional nanoparticles providing opportunities for designing complex nanostructures such as yolk&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Assisted Artesunate Delivery by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Synergistic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled nanomedicine based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with hidden missing linkers shows enhanced artesunate and photosensitizer co&#8208;loading capacity. In the presence of abundant physiological HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ from MOFs activates artesunate&#8208;based oxidative death of cancer cells. Released linkers undergo a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione, contributing to synergistic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Clinical translation of artesunate (ATS) as a potent antitumor drug has been obstructed by its rapid degradation and low bioavailability. Herein, we report the development of an ATS nanomedicine through the self&#8208;assembly with Mn[Co(CN)6]2/3&#9633;1/3 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that have hidden missing linkers. The defects in MOFs originating from the missing linkers play a key role in increasing the biological stability and tumor accumulation of ATS. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ATS can be co&#8208;loaded into MOFs for a synergistic antitumor efficacy. In the presence of intracellular HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ acts as an efficient catalyst to promote the bicarbonate&#8208;activated H2O2 system which oxidizes ATS to generate reactive oxygen species and induce oxidative death to cancer cells. The released [CoIII(CN)6] linker undergoes a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione to prevent the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species, contributing to synergistic chemodynamic therapy of ATS and photodynamic therapy of Ce6. Thus, defect&#8208;engineered MOFs with hidden missing linkers hold great promise in advancing the practical use of ATS as an antitumor medicine.

         <title>Reconfigurable Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Lattices: Static and Dynamic Angle Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Branching orientation control of four&#8208;arm junction lattices: by branch point sequences or by enforcing struts.







Abstract
Branched DNA motifs serve as the basic construction elements for all synthetic DNA nanostructures. However, precise control of branching orientation remains a key challenge to further heighten the overall structural order. In this study, we use two strategies to control the branching orientation. The first one is based on immobile Holliday junctions which employ specific nucleotide sequences at the branch points which dictate their orientation. The second strategy is to use angle&#8208;enforcing struts to fix the branching orientation with flexible spacers at the branch points. We have also demonstrated that the branching orientation control can be achieved dynamically, either by canonical Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing or non&#8208;canonical nucleobase interactions (e.g., i&#8208;motif and G&#8208;quadruplex). With precise angle control and feedback from the chemical environment, these results will enable novel DNA nanomechanical sensing devices, and precisely&#8208;ordered three&#8208;dimensional architectures.

         <title>Rapid Iron(III)&#8722;Fluoride&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIII&#8722;F (formed via ScIII activation) activates C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with reaction rates equivalent to or higher than FeIII&#8722;OH and FeIV=O oxidants. The driving force for fast C&#8722;H activation is ascribed to the higher bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the product formed (BDEF&#8722;H&gt;&#8811;BDEO&#8722;H).







Abstract
We anticipate high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;fluoride species will be highly effective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) oxidants because of the magnitude of the H&#8722;F bond (in the product) that drives HAT oxidation. We prepared a dimeric FeIII(F)&#8722;F&#8722;FeIII(F) complex (1) by reacting [FeII(NCCH3)2(TPA)](ClO4)2 (TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) with difluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane (difluoroiodobenzene). 1 was a sluggish oxidant, however, it was readily activated by reaction with Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids to yield a monomeric [FeIII(TPA)(F)(X)]+ complex (2) where X=F/OTf. 1 and 2 were characterized using NMR, EPR, UV/Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry. 2 was a remarkably reactive FeIII reagent for oxidative C&#8722;H activation, demonstrating reaction rates for hydrocarbon HAT comparable to the most reactive FeIII and FeIV oxidants.

         <title>Diazaborines Are a Versatile Platform to Develop ROS&#8208;Responsive Antibody Drug Conjugates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of physiologically stable diazaborines in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the key to the construction of ROS&#8208;responsive antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. These conjugates are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells. In this study we show for the first time the synthesis of a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ADC (VL&#8208;DAB31&#8208;SN&#8208;38) that is highly selective and cytotoxic to B&#8208;cell lymphoma (CLBL&#8208;1 cell line, IC50 value of 54.1&#8197;nM). The synthesis of this ADC was possible due to the discovery that diazaborines (DABs) are a very effective ROS&#8208;responsive unit that are also very stable in buffer and in plasma. DFT calculations performed on this system revealed a favorable energetic profile (&#916;GR=&#8722;74.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) similar to the oxidation mechanism of aromatic boronic acids. DABs&#8217; very fast formation rate and modularity enabled the construction of different ROS&#8208;responsive linkers featuring self&#8208;immolative modules, bioorthogonal functions, and bioconjugation handles. These structures were used in the site&#8208;selective functionalization of a VL antibody domain and in the construction of the homogeneous ADC.

         <title>Site&#8208;Fixed Hydroboration of Terminal and Internal Alkenes using BX3/iPr2NEt**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and general method for the hydroboration of alkenes, including aryl alkenes, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, aliphatic alkenes, and bio&#8208;derived alkenes, using BX3 as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The reaction was also applied to the synthesis of linear and branched 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes. The reaction is thought to proceed by a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general hydroboration of alkenes with BX3 (X=Br, Cl) as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The addition of iPr2NEt not only suppresses alkene polymerization and haloboration side reactions but also provides an &#8220;H&#8221; source for hydroboration. More importantly, the site&#8208;fixed installation of a boryl group at the original position of the internal double bond is readily achieved in contrast to conventional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration processes. Further application to the synthesis of 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes (n=3&#8211;10) is also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a major reaction pathway that involves radical species and operates through a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.

         <title>Rationally Designed Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 Hollow Heterostructures from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) are rationally designed and fabricated through a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;engaged synthetic approach. With the structural and compositional advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows efficient Zn&#8208;ion storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycle life.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn&#8208;based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8211;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8211;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn2+ insertion/extraction reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Heterostructured Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;ZnMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) are rationally designed and fabricated through a two-step metal&#8211;organic framework-engaged synthetic approach. With the structural and compositional advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows efficient Zn-ion storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and ultra-stable cycle life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mn-based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn-ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn-based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two-step metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;ZnMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8211;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8211;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion/extraction reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibition of Autophagy by a Small Molecule through Covalent Modification of the LC3 Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent probe, DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5, was discovered which demonstrates high selectivity to LC3A/B in the proteome. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 inhibits autophagy by attenuating LC3B lipidation, which subsequently reduces the extent of autophagic structure formation and later substrate degradation.







Abstract
The autophagic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein LC3 functions through interactions with LC3&#8208;interaction regions (LIRs) of other autophagy proteins, including autophagy receptors, which stands out as a promising protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) target for the intervention of autophagy. Post&#8208;translational modifications like acetylation of Lys49 on the LIR&#8208;interacting surface could disrupt the interaction, offering an opportunity to design covalent small molecules interfering with the interface. Through screening covalent compounds, we discovered a small molecule modulator of LC3A/B that covalently modifies LC3A/B protein at Lys49. Activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) based evaluations reveal that a derivative molecule DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 exhibits a potent covalent reactivity and selectivity to LC3A/B in HeLa cells. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 compromises LC3B lipidation in&#8197;vitro and in HeLa cells, leading to deficiency in the formation of autophagic structures and autophagic substrate degradation. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 could serve as a powerful tool for autophagy research as well as for therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Bis(perfluoropinacolato)silane: A Neutral Silane Lewis Superacid Activates Si&#8722;F Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Si&#8208;based Lewis superacid was synthesized by using highly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoropinacolato substituents. The formed silane was obtained as the acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct and comprehensively characterized. The reaction with Et3SiF led to fluoride abstraction yielding the anionic fluorosilicate and the acetonitrile stabilized silylium ion. Catalysis screenings demonstrated high activity in Lewis acid catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Despite the earth abundance and easy availability of silicon, only few examples of isolable neutral silicon centered Lewis superacids are precedent in the literature. To approach the general drawbacks of limited solubility and unselective deactivation pathways, we introduce a Lewis superacid, based on perfluorinated pinacol substituents. The compound is easily synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale as the corresponding acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct 1&#8901;(MeCN) and was fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SC&#8208;XRD) and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations. Lewis acidity investigations by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and fluoride abstraction experiments indicate a Lewis superacidic nature. The challenging Si&#8722;F bond activation of Et3SiF is realized and promising catalytic properties are demonstrated, consolidating the potential applicability of silicon centered Lewis acids in synthetic catalysis.

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Neutralization Assay Using Single Molecule Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed a simple neutralization assay based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. This assay can assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. We used this assay to profile neutralization capacity in patients infected with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and vaccinated individuals and show that this assay is useful for various clinical applications.







Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) manifests with high clinical variability and warrants sensitive and specific assays to analyze immune responses in infected and vaccinated individuals. Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed an assay to assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. The assay does not require live viruses or cells and can be performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory within two hours. We used this assay to assess neutralization and antibody levels in patients who died of COVID&#8208;19 and patients hospitalized for a short period of time and show that neutralization and antibody levels increase over time. We also adapted the assay for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and measured neutralization capacity in pre&#8208;pandemic healthy, COVID&#8208;19 infected, and vaccinated individuals. This assay is highly adaptable for clinical applications, such as vaccine development and epidemiological studies.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Peptide Dendrimer Inspired from Glatiramer Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To identify an alternative to the polymeric peptide drug Glatiramer Acetate (GA) used to treat multiple sclerosis, we tested peptide dendrimers with a size and composition similar to that of GA for their ability to induce the release of the cytokine IL1&#8208;Ra from primary human monocytes. The best dendrimer is as active as GA and is shown by fluorescence labelling to internalize into monocytes and to trigger a distinct anti&#8208;inflammatory response.







Abstract
Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a random polypeptide drug used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease. With the aim of identifying a precisely defined alternative to GA, we synthesized a library of peptide dendrimers with an amino acid composition similar to GA. We then challenged the dendrimers to trigger the release of the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;1 receptor antagonist (IL&#8208;1Ra) from human monocytes, which is one of the effects of GA on immune cells. Several of the largest dendrimers tested were as active as GA. Detailed profiling of the best hit showed that this dendrimer induces the differentiation of monocytes towards an M2 (anti&#8208;inflammatory) state as GA does, however with a distinct immune marker profile. Our peptide dendrimer might serve as starting point to develop a well&#8208;defined immunomodulatory analog of GA.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Doped SnS2 Nanoflowers for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based materials have been extensively explored in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction to formate, but reaching high selectivity and durability at large current densities remains challenging. Here, a catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy was formed in situ through dynamic restructuring of Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers, leading to an excellent CO2 to formate performance over a wide potential window.







Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing energy consumption and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into chemicals/fuels is becoming a promising yet challenging solution. Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as attractive electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate but suffer from insufficient selectivity and activity, especially at large cathodic current densities. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers can undergo in situ dynamic restructuring to generate catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy for highly selective electrochemical CO2RR to formate over a wide potential window. Theoretical thermodynamic analysis of reaction energetics indicates that the optimal electronic structure of the Sn active site can be regulated by both S&#8208;doping and Cu&#8208;alloying to favor formate formation, while the CO and H2 pathways will be suppressed. Our findings provide a rational strategy for electronic modulation of metal active site(s) for the design of active and selective electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

     alt="Dynamic Restructuring of Cu-Doped SnS2 Nanoflowers for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sn-based materials have been extensively explored in the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction to formate, but reaching high selectivity and durability at large current densities remains challenging. Here, a catalytically active S-doped Cu/Sn alloy was formed in situ through dynamic restructuring of Cu-doped SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers, leading to an excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formate performance over a wide potential window.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ever-increasing energy consumption and continuous rise in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into chemicals/fuels is becoming a promising yet challenging solution. Sn-based materials are identified as attractive electrocatalysts for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to formate but suffer from insufficient selectivity and activity, especially at large cathodic current densities. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu-doped SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers can undergo in situ dynamic restructuring to generate catalytically active S-doped Cu/Sn alloy for highly selective electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to formate over a wide potential window. Theoretical thermodynamic analysis of reaction energetics indicates that the optimal electronic structure of the Sn active site can be regulated by both S-doping and Cu-alloying to favor formate formation, while the CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pathways will be suppressed. Our findings provide a rational strategy for electronic modulation of metal active site(s) for the design of active and selective electrocatalysts towards CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Modular Cascade Synthetic Strategy Toward Structurally Constrained Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel modular synthetic strategy for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via a cascade reaction. Notably, the obtained BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking.







Abstract
A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs) via a cascade reaction from the readily available ortho&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4&#8208;boron migration and successive two&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs bearing B&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;a&#8208;1&#8201;i) or BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;n&#8208;1&#8201;t) and double [4]helicene (1&#8201;u&#8208;1&#8201;v) are constructed by this cascade reaction. Remarkably, this synthetic strategy is characterized by modest yields (20&#8211;50&#8201;%) and broad substrate scope (18 examples) with versatile functional group tolerance. The resultant sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs show good stability under ambient conditions and are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Interestingly enough, BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene 1&#8201;o forms a unique alternating &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer of enantiomers within a helical columnar superstructure, while BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene 1&#8201;u establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking. The synthetic approach reported herein represents a powerful tool for the rapid generation of novel sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs, which are highly attractive for the elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship and for potential optoelectronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel modular synthetic strategy for the construction of difficult-to-access structurally constrained boron-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via a cascade reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult-to-access structurally constrained boron-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc-B-PAHs) via a cascade reaction from the readily available ortho-aryl-substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4-boron migration and successive two-fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc-B-PAHs bearing B-doped [4]helicene (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;i&lt;/b&gt;) or BN-doped [4]helicene (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;n&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;t&lt;/b&gt;) and double [4]helicene (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;u&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;v&lt;/b&gt;) are constructed by this cascade reaction.

         <title>A DNA Molecular Robot that Autonomously Walks on the Cell Membrane to Drive Cell Motility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA molecular robot that autonomously walks on the cell membrane to drive the cell motility has been developed. The DNA robot could move stepwise on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signal pathway regulation of desired cellular behavior.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular robots can execute sophisticated molecular tasks at nanometer resolution. However, a molecular robot capable of controlling cellular behavior remains unexplored. Herein, we report a self&#8208;propelled DNA robot operating on the cell membrane to control the migration of a cell. Driven by DNAzyme catalytic activity, the DNA robot could autonomously and stepwise move on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signaling for cell motility. The cell membrane&#8208;associated continuous motion and operation of a DNA robot allowed for the ultrasensitive regulation of MET/AKT signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling to enhance cell migration. Finally, we designed distinct conditional DNA robots to orthogonally manipulate the cell migration in a coculture of mixed cell populations. We have developed a novel strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;driving molecular robot, representing a promising avenue for precise cell manipulation with nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Rapid, Ordered Polymerization of Crystalline Semiconducting Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid synthesis of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) and exploration of the polymerization mechanism are highly desired for the research of crystalline porous polymers, but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a scalable microwave&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy to successfully prepare a series of highly crystalline and semiconducting CTFs within 20 minutes for the first time. By in&#8208;situ imaging and time&#8208;dependent characterization, we proposed an ordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization mechanism for crystalline CTFs, in which the monomers rapidly polymerize into periodic 2D molecular sheets within 10 s and then grow into more ordered framework structures. Photocatalytic study of CTF with different crystallinity revealed that large crystalline domain could significantly improve the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, single&#8208;layer and few&#8208;layer crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets could be obtained through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered CTFs and exhibit nearly fivefold improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate up to 7971 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is superior to most reported polymeric photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy is presented to synthesize unsymmetrically&#8208;linked heterocycles within stereoselective tetrasubstituted olefins. This reaction is proposed to occur via a vinyl&#8211;Pd II intermediate capable of initiating the cyclization of various alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles. Products are formed in up to 96% yield and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained using low catalyst loadings. The transformation was scalable up to 1 mmol and mechanistic studies suggest a syn &#8208; carbopalladation of the carbamoyl chloride followed by Pd II &#8208; catalyzed cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled In&#8208;Cell Generation of Active Palladium(0) Species for Bioorthogonal Decaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water&#8208;soluble Na2PdCl4 as a simple source of Pd(II) which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd(0) species. Once generated, Pd(0) triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalysed Asymmetric Addition and Alkylation of Secondary Phosphine Oxides for the Synthesis of P&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordination group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides. A series of tertiary phosphine oxides were generated with up to 99% yield and 99.5% ee with wide functional group tolerances. Mechanistic studies reveal that (R)&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides preferentially interact with the cobalt catalysts to produce P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Non&#8208;Natural Photoenzyme for Improved Photon Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoenzymes are biological catalysts that use light to convert starting materials to products. These catalysts require photon absorption for each turnover, making quantum efficiency an important optimization parameter. Flavin&#8208;dependent 'ene&#8217;&#8208;reductases (EREDs) display latent photoenzymatic activity for synthetically valuable hydroalkylations; however, protein engineering has not been used to optimize this non&#8208;natural function. Here, we describe a protein engineering platform for the high throughput optimization of photoenzymes. A single round of engineering results in improved catalytic function toward the synthesis of &#120574; , &#120575; , &#120576; &#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides. Mechanistic studies indicate that key mutations can alter the enzyme's excited state dynamics, enhance its photon efficiency, and ultimately increase catalyst performance. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that engineered variants display dramatically decreased radical lifetimes &#8211; indicating an evolution toward a concerted mechanism. Overall, this platform enables the development and optimization of photoenzymes for tailored applications in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>An NADPH&#8208;Dependent Ketoreductase Catalyses the Tetracyclic to Pentacyclic Skeletal Rearrangement in Chartreusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rearrangement from the tetracyclic to the pentacyclic compound in the biosynthesis of the antitumor antibiotic chartreusin is very concise and only requires two redox enzymes. ChaZ mediates a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation to give a lactone intermediate. Subsequently, ChaE catalyses an unusual ketoreduction on an ester carbonyl group to give an acetal moiety, followed by a series of spontaneous reaction to construct the pentacyclic compound.







Abstract
Redox tailoring enzymes play key roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in type&#8197;II polyketides. In chartreusin biosynthesis, the early 13C&#8208;labeling experiments and bioinformatic analysis suggest the unusual aglycone is originated from a tetracyclic anthracyclic polyketide. Here, we demonstrated that the carbon skeleton rearrangement from a linear anthracyclic polyketide to an angular pentacyclic biosynthetic intermediate requires two redox enzymes. The flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase ChaZ catalyses a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation on resomycin C to form a seven&#8208;membered lactone. Subsequently, a ketoreductase ChaE rearranges the carbon skeleton and affords the &#945;&#8208;pyrone containing pentacyclic intermediate in an NADPH&#8208;dependent manner via tandem reactions including the reduction of the lactone carbonyl group, Aldol&#8208;type reaction, followed by a spontaneous &#947;&#8208;lactone ring formation, oxidation and aromatization. Our work reveals an unprecedented function of a ketoreductase that contributes to generate structural complexity of aromatic polyketide.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Site Concerted Proton&#8211;Electron Transfer in a Manganese&#8208;Based Complete Functional Model for [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a mononuclear manganese complex, synchronous e&#8722; and H+ transfer occurred by a concerted pathway from spatially distinct sites to the reaction center (see scheme). By virtue of the multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET) mechanism, this model complex lowered the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to approximately 20&#8197;mV when the weak acid phenol was used as a proton source.







Abstract
The active site of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (H2ase) is preorganized with an amine (azadithiolate) as a proton relay and a [4Fe4S] subunit as an electron reservoir, which together lower the overpotential for proton reduction and hydrogen oxidation by multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET). Herein, we report a mononuclear manganese complex, fac&#8208;[Mn(CO)3(6&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenol)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;quinoline) Br] (1), as a rare model to fully mimic the functions of the H2ase. In 1, a redox&#8208;active bidentate ligand with a pendent phenol replicates the roles of the electron reservoir and the proton relay in the enzyme. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed two consecutive MS&#8208;CPET processes in the catalytic cycle, in each of which an electron stored in the reductive ligand and a proton at the proximal phenol moiety are transferred to the Mn center in a concerted way. By virtue of this mechanism, complex 1 exhibited a low overpotential comparable to that of natural enzyme in electrochemical hydrogen production using phenol as a proton source.

         <title>CO&#8208;Tolerant PEMFC Anodes Enabled by Synergistic Catalysis between Iridium Single&#8208;Atom Sites and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the synergistic effect between single&#8208;atom Ir sites and Ir nanoparticles, a novel CO&#8208;tolerating PEMFC anode catalyst (PEMFC=proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell) exhibits excellent hydrogen oxidation reaction and CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity. On this foundation, the catalyst can maintain a stable operation state in a H2/1000&#8197;ppm CO mixture.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are limited by their extreme sensitivity to trace&#8208;level CO impurities, thus setting a strict requirement for H2 purity and excluding the possibility to directly use cheap crude hydrogen as fuel. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in which a novel catalyst comprising both Ir particles and Ir single&#8208;atom sites (IrNP@IrSA&#8208;N&#8208;C) addresses the CO poisoning issue. The Ir single&#8208;atom sites are found not only to be good CO oxidizing sites, but also excel in scavenging the CO molecules adsorbed on Ir particles in close proximity, thereby enabling the Ir particles to reserve partial active sites towards H2 oxidation. The interplay between Ir nanoparticles and Ir single&#8208;atom centers confers the catalyst with both excellent H2 oxidation activity (1.19&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and excellent CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity (85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in PEMFCs; the catalyst also tolerates CO in H2/CO mixture gas at a level that is two times better than that of the current best PtRu/C catalyst.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Shearinines D and G: A Convergent Approach to Indole Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total syntheses of the indole diterpenoids (+)&#8208;shearinine G and (+)&#8208;shearinine D are disclosed. The successful routes rely on late&#8208;stage coupling of two complex fragments. Formation of the challenging  trans  &#8208;hydrindane motif was accomplished by intramolecular diastereoselective cyclopropanation. A one&#8208;pot sequence consisting of Sharpless dihydroxylation/Achmatowicz reaction was developed to install the dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane motif. The indenone subunit was accessed by Prins cyclization. Tuning the electronic nature of the substituents on the parent arylcarboxaldehyde allowed access to divergent products that were further transformed to shearinines G and D. En route to the various targets, Riley&#8208;type oxidation of a bicyclic enone yielded unexpected stereochemical surprises.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here, we present a multi&#8208;cycle chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified RNA with simplified solid&#8208;phase handling to overcome size limitations of RNA synthesis. It combines the advantages of classical chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis and enzymatic synthesis methods using magnetic streptavidin beads and biotinylated RNA. Successful introduction of light&#8208;controllable RNA nucleotides into the tRNAMet sequence was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The methods tolerate modifications in the RNA phosphodiester backbone and allow introductions of photocaged and photoswitchable nucleotides as well as photocleavable strand breaks and fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis by Programmed Disassembly of Reticular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond&#8208;breaking is an essential process in natural and synthetic chemical transformations. Accordingly, the ability of researchers to strategically dictate which bonds in a given system will be broken translates to greater synthetic control, as historically evidenced in fields such as organic synthesis. Here, we report extending the concept of selective bond&#8208;breaking to reticular materials, in a new synthetic approach that we call Clip&#8208;off Chemistry. We show that bond&#8208;breaking in these structures can be controlled at the molecular level; is periodic, quantitative and selective; is effective in reactions performed in either solid or liquid phases; and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal fashion involving the entire bulk precursor sample. We validate Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by synthesizing two topologically distinct, three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from two reported 3&#8208;D MOFs, and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from a metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP). Clip&#8208;off Chemistry opens the door to programmed disassembly of reticular materials and thus, to the design and synthesis of countless new molecules and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Concurrent Prebiotic Formation of Nucleoside&#8208;Amidophosphates and Nucleoside&#8208;Triphosphates Potentiates Transition from Abiotic to Biotic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization of nucleic acids in biology utilizes 5'nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as substrates. The prebiotic availability of NTPs has been unresolved and other derivatives of nucleoside&#8208;monophosphates (NMPs) have been studied. However, this latter approach necessitates a change in chemistries when transitioning to biology. Herein we show that diamidophosphate (DAP), in a one&#8208;pot amidophosphorylation&#8208;hydrolysis setting converts NMPs to the corresponding NTPs via 5'&#8208;nucleoside amidophosphates (NaPs). The resulting crude mixture of NTPs are accepted by proteinaceous&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;polymerases as substrates for nucleic acid polymerization. This phosphorylation also operates at the level of oligonucleotides enabling ribozyme&#8208;mediated ligation. This one&#8208;pot protocol for simultaneous generation of NaPs and NTPs, suggests that the transition from prebioticphosphorylation and oligomerization to an enzymatic processivepolymerization can be more continuous than previously anticipated.</dc:description>

         <title>Five&#8208;fold Symmetric Pentaindolo&#8208; and Pentakis(benzoindolo)&#8208;Corannulenes: Unique Structural Dynamics Derived from the Combination of Helical&#8208; and Bowl&#8208;Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes bearing quintuple azahelicene units,  10  and  11  , were prepared and their dynamic behaviors were studied both experimentally and theoretically. The fused corannulenes were synthesized from  sym  &#8208;pentabromocorannulene in three steps, including Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;H arylation, and  N  &#8208;methylation. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis for  10  displayed a conformer possessing a  P(M)  bowl chirality and a  PPMPM  (  PMPMM  ) helical chirality, which was found to be the most stable conformer(s). Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements of  10  and  11  revealed that their structural isomers can be interconvertible in solution, depending on their steric congestion around the helical scaffolds. Automated search for conformers in the equilibrium and transition states by Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method revealed their interconversion networks, including bowl&#8208;inversion and helical&#8208;inversion, the activation barriers of which were estimated to be 2.6&#8211;3.6 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  and 9.8&#8211;26.9 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  , respectively. These values are smaller than those of the pristine corannulene (12.5 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  ) and the corresponding azahelicenes (22.0 and 35.3 kcal&#183;mol  &#8722;1  ), respectively. This analysis indicated that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties influence the conformational dynamics, which leads to mitigation of the activation energy barriers for isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Pd(I) Dimer enabled Remote Functionalization: Access to Fluorinated 1,1&#8208;Diaryl Alkanes with Unprecedented Speed</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While remote functionalization via chain walking has the potential to enable access to molecules via novel disconnections, such processes require relatively long reaction times and can be in need of elevated temperatures. This work features a remote arylation in less than 10 min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable Pd(I) dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy  2  t  Bu)]  2  , which in contrast to its P  t  Bu  3  counterpart does not trigger direct coupling at the initiation site, but regioconvergent and chemoselective remote functionalization to yield valuable fluorinated 1,1&#8208;diaryl alkanes. Our combined experimental and computational studies rationalize the origins of switchability, which is primarily due to differences in dispersion interactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While remote functionalization via chain walking has the potential to enable access to molecules via novel disconnections, such processes require relatively long reaction times and can be in need of elevated temperatures. This work features a remote arylation in less than 10 min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air-stable Pd(I) dimer [Pd(&#956;-I)(PCy  2  t  Bu)]  2  , which in contrast to its P  t  Bu  3  counterpart does not trigger direct coupling at the initiation site, but regioconvergent and chemoselective remote functionalization to yield valuable fluorinated 1,1-diaryl alkanes.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) Used for Target Specific Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Photooxygenation in an Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phototherapy has emerged as a powerful approach for interrupting &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) self&#8208;assembly. However, deeper tissue penetration and safer photosensitizers are urgent to be exploited for avoiding damaging nearby normal tissues and improving therapeutic effectiveness. A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II photooxygenation catalyst is presented here to settle the abovementioned challenges. By encapsulating the pyridinium hemicyanine dye DSM with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;section in NIR&#8208;II window into the porphyrin&#8208;based HOF, the resultant DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 exhibits significant two&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;II&#8208;excited Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to generate singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) for A&#946; oxidation. Further, the target peptides of KLVFFAED (KD8) are covalently grafted on DSM@n&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 to enhance the blood&#8722;brain barrier (BBB) permeability and A&#946; selectivity. The well&#8208;designed HOF&#8208;based photooxygenation catalyst shows an outstanding inhibitory effect of A&#946; aggregation upon the NIR&#8208;II irradiation. Further  in vivo  studies demonstrate the obvious decrease of craniocerebral A&#946; plaques and recovery of memory deficits in triple&#8208;transgenic AD (3&#215;Tg&#8208;AD) model mice. Our present study provides new insights into the applications of HOFs as photo&#8208;therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Polycarbonates by Organocatalytic Copolymerization of CO2 and Epoxides: From High Pressure and Temperature to Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of  CO  2  &#8208;based polycarbonates (CO  2  &#8208;PCs), via ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of CO  2  and epoxides, is a promising way to solve two major challenges confronting sustainable society: greenhouse effect and white plastic pollution. The development of efficient catalysts is crucial for selective synthesis of CO  2  &#8208;PCs. However, conversion of CO  2  into CO  2  &#8208;PCs under ambient conditions (1 atm pressure and room temperature),  affording a more sustainable process that circumvents the energy&#8208;intensive process and reduces the high carbon&#8208;costs  , is still a great challenging task. In this contribution, organophosphazenes combined with triethylborane (TEB) were selected as binary organocatalyts for the copolymerization of CO  2  and epoxides. Both the activity and selectivity were highly dependent on the nature of phosphazenes.  2,4,6&#8208;  Tris[tri(1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)&#8208;iminophosphorane]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (C  3  N  3  &#8208;Py&#8208;P  3  ) with a relatively low basicity (p  K  a  = 26.5 in CD  3  CN) and a bulky molecular size (&#966; = 1.3 nm) exhibited an unprecedented efficiency (TON up to 12240) and selectivity (&gt;99% polymer selectivity and  &gt;99% carbonate linkages  ) toward copolymerization of CO  2  and cyclohexene oxide (CHO), and produced CO  2  &#8208;PCs with high molar masses (  M  n  s up to 275.5 kDa) at 1 MPa of CO  2  and 80 &#176;C. Surprisingly, this binary catalytic system achieved efficient CO  2  /CHO copolymerization with TOF up to 95 h  &#8208;1  at 1 atm pressure and room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Vitamin D   Inhibits the Early Aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and  Modulates Exocytosis Revealed by Electrochemical Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) localizes at presynaptic terminal and modulates synaptic functions.  Increasing evidence demonstrate that &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, forming at the early of aggregation, are cytotoxic and is thus related to brain neurodegenerative diseases.  Herein, we find that Vitamin D (VD) can reduce neurocytotoxicity. The reduced neurocytotoxicity might be attributed to the less amount of large&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers inhibited by VD, measured by electrochemical collision at single particle level, which are not observable with traditionally ensembled method.  Single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA) results show that VD can recover the amount of  neurotransmitter release during exocytosis induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers  , further verifying the neuroprotection of VD. Our study reveals the neuroprotective role of VD through inhibiting &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation, which is envisioned to be of great importance in treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocleavable Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes:&#160; Fast Release with Spatiotemporal Control in Inner Leaflets of Plasma Membrane, Nuclear Envelope, and Secretory Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanosensitive flipper probes are attracting interest as fluorescent reporters of membrane order and tension in biological systems. We here introduce PhotoFlippers which contain a photocleavable linker and an ultralong tether between mechanophore and various targeting motifs. Upon irradiation, the original probe is released and labels the most ordered membrane that is accessible by intermembrane transfer. Spatiotemporal control from photocleavable flippers is essential to access open, dynamic or elusive membrane motifs without chemical or physical interference. For instance, fast release with light is shown to place the original small&#8208;molecule probes into the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope to image changes in membrane tension, at specific points in time of membrane trafficking along the secretory pathway, or in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to explore membrane asymmetry. These results identify PhotoFlippers as useful chemistry tools to enable research in biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Sortase mediated multi&#8208;fragment assemblies by ligation site switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a powerful tool of protein chemistry allowing the ligation of peptides containing LPxTG sorting motifs and N&#8208;terminal glycine nucleophiles. The installation of a sorting motif into the product prohibits the assembly of multiple fragments by SML. Here we report multi&#8208;fragment SML based on switchable sortase substrates. Substitution of the Leu residue by disulfide containing Cys(StBu) results in active sorting motifs, which are inactivatable by reduction. In combination with a photo&#8208;protected N&#8208;Gly nucleophile multi&#8208;fragment SML is enabled by repetitive cycles of SML and ligation site switching. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept four&#8208;fragment ligation, the assembly of peptide probes for bivalent chromatin binding proteins and oligomerization of peptide antigens. Biochemical and immuno&#8208;assays demonstrated functionality of these probes rendering them promising tools for immunology and chromatin biochemistry.</dc:description>

The 1,5&#8208;H transfer of alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines would be one of the most straightforward yet challenging approach to this class of compounds since it may, in principle, form two regioisomeric products involving two different C&#8208;C triple bonds. Herein, a catalytic recipe of copper halides with mixed oxidation states, i.e., CuCl/CuBr  2  , has been identified to address the issues of the side reaction of conjugate addition and the selectivity of 1,5&#8208;H transfer of the key intermediate, alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines, in EATA (Enantioselective Allenation of Terminal Alkynes) reaction involving the conjugated 2&#8208;alkynals. This protocol could accommodate a wide range of functional groups providing a series of allenynes with a very high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). In addition, the enantioenriched allenynes can be readily transformed into various building blocks and applied to the highly enantioselective total synthesis of linear allenic natural product  scorodonin  for the first time. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations elucidated the high regioselectivity for observed 1,5&#8208;H transfer within the intermediate of 1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines. The calculated energy difference between two of the most stable transition states of 3.4 kcal/mol accounts for a selectivity of over 99:1, which is in perfect agreement with the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Density&#8208;Dependent Emission Colors from a Conformation&#8208;Switching Chromophore in Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving full&#8208;color emission from a single chromophore is not only highly desirable from practical considerations, but also greatly challenging for fundamental research. Herein, we demonstrated the density&#8208;dependent emission colors from a single boron&#8208;containing chromophore, from which multi&#8208;color fluorescent polyurethanes were prepared as well. Originated from its switchable molecular conformations, the emission color of the chromophore was found to be governed by the packing density and also strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding interactions. Therefore, the chromophore was incorporated into polyurethanes to achieve full&#8208;color emitting materials, of which the emission color was only dependent on the chromophore density and could be tuned via synthetic approach by controlling the compositions. More interestingly, the emission colors from these polyurethanes could also be modulated via physical approaches, including by swelling/deswelling process, compression under high pressure, and even blending the fluorescent polyurethane with non&#8208;emitting ones.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Urea, an agricultural fertilizer, nourishes humanity. The century&#8208;old Bosch&#8208;Meiser process provides the world&#8217;s urea. It is multi&#8208;step, consumes enormous amounts of non&#8208;renewable energy, and has a large CO  2  footprint. An eco&#8208;friendly synthesis for urea is a priority. Herein we report a single&#8208;step Pd/LTA&#8208;3A catalyzed synthesis of urea from CO  2  and NH  3  under ambient conditions, powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH  3  and providing the photothermal driving force for&#160;urea formation, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H  2  O, shifting the equilibrium towards urea production. The solar urea conversion rate from NH  3  and CO  2  is 87 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  . This advance represents a first step towards the use of solar energy in urea production. It provides insights into green fertilizer production, and inspires the vision of sustainable, modular plants for distributed production of urea on farms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A molecular design to high&#8208;performance red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) emitters remains demanding. Herein a series of dinuclear platinum(II) complexes featuring strong intramolecular Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions has been developed by using N&#8208;deprotonated &#945;&#8208;carboline as a bridging ligand. The complexes in doped thin films exhibit efficient red to NIR emissions from short&#8208;lived (&#964; = 0.9&#8722;2.1 &#956;s) triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Red OLEDs demonstrated high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 23.3% among the best Pt(II) complexes&#8208;doped devices. The maximum EQE of 15.0% and radiance of 285 W sr&#8208;1 m&#8208;2 for NIR OLED (&#955;EL = 725 nm) are unprecedented for devices based on discrete molecular emitters. Both red and NIR devices show very small efficiencies roll&#8208;off at high brightness. Appealing operational lifetimes have also been revealed for the devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiopure monohydrosilanes are versatile chiral reagents for alcohol resolution and mechanistic investigation. Herein, we have demonstrated the asymmetric synthesis of monohydrosilanes via an intramolecular hydrosilylation strategy. This protocol is suitable for the synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered cyclic monohydrosilanes, including a class of chiral oxa&#8208;silacycles, with excellent diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and enantioselectivities.&#160; Notably, the catalyst loading could be reduced to 0.1 mol% which represents one of the most efficient method to access chiral monohydrosilanes. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation indicate this Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction might undergo a Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism, and the enantio&#8208;determining step was predicted to be oxidative addition of Si&#8211;H bond</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Allenation of Terminal Alkynes with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(SIPr)NTf2 has been identified for the room temperature ATA reaction to afford diverse 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline as amine and aldehyde and TFE or HFIP as the mediator. A formal synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine and synthetic transformations have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed room temperature allenation of terminal alkynes (ATA) with aldehydes affording 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with diverse functional groups has been developed by identifying a gold(I) catalyst and an amine. The practicality of this reaction has been demonstrated by a ten gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the synthetic potentials have been demonstrated via various transformations and formal total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the gold catalyst, the aldehyde effect, the fluoroalkyl hydroxyl solvent (TFE or HFIP) and the structure of amine are vital in this room temperature ATA reaction.

         <title>A General Strategy for Instantaneous and Continuous Synthesis of Ultrasmall Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrasmall MOF nanoparticles could be instantaneously synthesized in a continuous way by a facile and universal strategy with the aid of high gravity intensification technology. This approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs. The as&#8208;prepared ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for the Knoevenagel reaction.







Abstract
Ultrasmall metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) may generate unique properties to expand the scope of applications. However, the synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize ultrasmall MOFs by high gravity technology. With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high&#8208;gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94&#8201;% or 75&#8201;% compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8. More importantly, this approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs, which may promote the convenient synthesis and practical applications of ultrasmall MOFs in large&#8208;scale.

         <title>Sequential Selective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P Bond Functionalizations: An Entry to Bioactive Arylated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly unified, straightforward method of direct sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;P bond functionalization has been developed to access a variety of synthetically and highly useful bioactive benzhydrylamine, benzhydrylthioether, and triarylmethane motifs from commercially available arenes and simple aldehydes.







Abstract
Organophosphonium salts containing C(sp3)&#8722;+P bonds are among the most utilized reagents in organic synthesis for constructing C&#8722;C double bonds. However, their use as C&#8208;selective electrophilic groups is rare. Here, we explore an efficient and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for sequential chemo&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P bond functionalizations. In the present study, C&#8722;H alkylation resulting in the synthesis of benzhydryl triarylphosphonium salts was achieved by one&#8208;pot, four&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling reactions of simple and commercially available starting materials. The utility of the resulting phosphonium salt building blocks was demonstrated by the chemoselective post&#8208;functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;+PPh3 groups to achieve aminations, thiolations, and arylations. In this way, benzhydrylamines, benzhydrylthioethers, and triarylmethanes, structural motifs that are present in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, are readily accessed. These include the synthesis of two anticancer agents from simple materials in only two to three steps. Additionally, a protocol for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive drugs has been developed using benzhydrylphosphonium salts. This new approach should provide novel transformations for application in both academic and pharmaceutical research.

         <title>Electron Localization and Lattice Strain Induced by Surface Lithium Doping Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Formate from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped SnLi catalyst prepared by controlled electrochemical lithiation presented an outstanding partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of formate production, due to the local electron localization and lattice strain on the Sn surface. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed a high power density and an excellent stability of &gt;800 cycles.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 conversion to formate is a promising approach for reducing CO2 level and obtaining value&#8208;added chemicals, but its partial current density is still insufficient to meet the industrial demands. Herein, we developed a surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped tin (s&#8208;SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction to formate. The s&#8208;SnLi electrocatalyst exhibited one of the best CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate performances, with a partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for producing formate and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &gt;800 cycles. Our work suggests a promising approach to incorporate electron localization and lattice strain for the catalytic sites to achieve efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.

         <dc:description>
A 3D K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene with a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formed on its surface was employed as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors with high power density and superior cycling stability. This work offers a new insight into design of MXene&#8208;based anode material and the relationship between solvation structure and SEI formation.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance anode materials for potassium&#8208;based energy storage devices with long&#8208;term cyclability requires combined innovations from rational material design to electrolyte optimization. A three&#8208;dimensional K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene with enlarged interlayer distance was constructed for efficient electrochemical potassium&#8208;ion storage. We found that the optimized solvation structure of the concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolyte leads to the formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx electrode, which is beneficial for interfacial stability and reaction kinetics. As a proof of concept, 3D K+&#8208;Ti3C2Tx//activated carbon (AC) potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) were assembled, which exhibited promising electrochemical performances. These results highlight the significant roles of both rational structure design and electrolyte optimization for highly reactive MXene&#8208;based anode materials in energy storage devices.

         <title>Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the fungal ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide phomopsin was elucidated by gene inactivation experiments. Notably, chlorination by tyrosinase&#8208;like enzyme PhomQ1 and desaturation of amino acid moieties by UstYa family (DUF3328) proteins PhomYc/Yd/Ye were uncovered. Besides the known function of UstYa homologues, this study unveiled the remarkable functional diversity of these fungi&#8208;specific proteins.







Abstract
UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin&#8197;A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues, phomYc, phomYd, and phomYe, are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.

         <title>An Integrated Photoelectrochemical Nanotool for Intracellular Drug Delivery and Evaluation of Treatment Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated photocathodic nanotool was fabricated for dual&#8208;functional intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of cellular oxidative stress in single live cell.







Abstract
With reduced background and high sensitivity, photoelectrochemistry (PEC) may be applied as an intracellular nanotool and open a new technological direction of single&#8208;cell study. Nevertheless, the present palette of single&#8208;cell tools lacks such a PEC&#8208;oriented solution. Here a dual&#8208;functional photocathodic single&#8208;cell nanotool capable of direct electroosmotic intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of oxidative stress is devised by engineering a target&#8208;specific organic molecule/NiO/Ni film at the tip of a nanopipette. Specifically, the organic molecule probe serves simultaneously as the biorecognition element and sensitizer to synergize with p&#8208;type NiO. Upon intracellular delivery at picoliter level, the oxidative stress effect will cause structural change of the organic probe, switching its optical absorption and altering the cathodic response. This work has revealed the potential of PEC single&#8208;cell nanotool and extended the boundary of current single&#8208;cell electroanalysis.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Growth of Preferred&#8208;Oriented MOF Thin Film on Nanowire Array for High&#8208;Performance Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, as well as precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on a nanowire array substrate. Compared to 2D thin films, the Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film shows one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD and fastest response speed among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT.







Abstract
High&#8208;quality MOF thin films with high orientation and controlled thickness are extremely desired for applications. However, they have been only successfully fabricated on flat substrates. Those MOF 2D thin films are limited by low exposed area and slow mass transport. To overcome these issues, MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, and precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on nanowire array substrate for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film is superior to corresponding 2D thin films and showed one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD, and fastest response among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT. This work provides a feasible approach to grow preferred&#8208;oriented 3D MOF thin film, offering new perspectives for constructing MOF&#8208;based heterostructures for advanced applications.

         <title>Synergetic Cobalt&#8208;Copper&#8208;Based Bimetal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoboxes toward Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;copper&#8208;based conductive bimetal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) have been synthesized as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst, through a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the bimetallic synergetic effect and the well&#8208;designed hollow architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and robust long&#8208;term stability toward efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts and understanding their underlying catalytic mechanism are of significant importance for the high&#8208;performance energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, we report novel CoCu&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) as promising catalysts toward efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), fabricated via a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the highly exposed bimetal centers and the well&#8208;designed architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent OER activity and stability, with a small overpotential of 271&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high turnover frequency value of 0.326&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#8197;mV. In combination of quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed CoCu&#8208;based oxyhydroxide analogue during OER is believed to account for the high OER activity of CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs, where the electronic synergy between Co and neighbouring Cu atoms promotes the O&#8722;O bond coupling toward fast OER kinetics.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers from Amphiphilic Phosphodiester&#8208;Linked Azobenzene Trimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) of amphiphilic oligomers in aqueous medium is presented. Azobenzene&#8208;derived oligophosphates undergo morphological transformation upon light&#8208;triggered isomerization. In a reversible process, sheet&#8208;like SPs are switched to toroid&#8208;shaped objects by changing the configuration of the building blocks.







Abstract
An amphiphilic phosphodiester&#8208;linked azobenzene trimer has been exploited in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers. The trimer can reversibly undergo thermal and photoisomerization between Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers. Its self&#8208;assembly properties in aqueous medium have been investigated by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, demonstrating that E&#8208; and Z&#8208;azobenzene trimers form supramolecular nanosheets and toroidal nanostructures, respectively. By virtue of the E/Z photoisomerization of the azobenzene units, the two different supramolecular morphologies can be switched by photoirradiation. The findings pave a way towards stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers which hold great promise in the development of smart functional materials.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Mediated N2&#8208;Splitting and Functionalization in the Presence of a Coordinated Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molybdenum pincer for N2&#8208;splitting and functionalization is reported. The N2&#8208;cleavage affords a molybdenum nitrido complex and proceeds in the presence of a coordinated alkyne, that is, in the presence of a weaker C&#8801;C bond. The spatially and rotational restricted alkyne moiety is also tolerated during N&#8208;functionalization of the former nitrido complex.







Abstract
A new [PCCP]&#8208;coordinated molybdenum platform comprising a coordinated alkyne was employed for the cleavage of molecular dinitrogen. The coordinated &#951;2&#8208;alkyne was left unaffected during this reduction. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via an initially generated terminal N2&#8208;complex, which is converted to a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;(&#951;1:&#951;1)&#8208;N2&#8208;bridged intermediate prior to N&#8722;N bond cleavage. Protonation, alkylation and acylation of the resulting molybdenum nitrido complex led to the corresponding N&#8208;functionalized imido complexes. Upon oxidation of the N&#8208;acylated imido derivative in MeCN, a fumaronitrile fragment was built up via C&#8722;C coupling of MeCN to afford a dinuclear molybdenum complex. The key finding that the strong N&#8801;N bond may be cleaved in the presence of a weaker, but spatially constrained C&#8801;C bond contradicts the widespread paradigm that coordinated alkynes are in general more reactive than gaseous N2.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Substitution with Copper(I) Homoenolates Generated from Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with NHC&#8208;stabilized copper(I) homoenolates generated from cyclopropanols is developed that affords &#947;&#8208;chiral ketones in excellent regio&#8208; and high enantioselectivities. This process enables the generation of chiral quaternary carbon centers and features a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
By using copper(I) homoenolates as nucleophiles, which are generated through the ring&#8208;opening of 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols, a catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with allyl phosphates is achieved in high to excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. Both 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols and allylic phosphates enjoy broad substrate scopes. Remarkably, various functional groups, such as ether, ester, tosylate, imide, alcohol, nitro, and carbamate are well tolerated. Moreover, the present method is nicely extended to the asymmetric construction of quaternary carbon centers. Some control experiments argue against a radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism and a catalytic cycle based on a two&#8208;electron process is proposed. Finally, the synthetic utilities of the product are showcased by means of the transformations of the terminal olefin group and the ketone group.

         <title>Putting DNA to Work as Generic Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA is a true polymer that has been regarded as the perfect building block for the construction of diverse materials. DNA gels possess many unique properties and are particularly suitable as generic materials. This Review discusses recent advances in the construction of DNA networks and highlights the applications of DNA as generic materials in various fields.







Abstract
DNA is a true polymer that stores the genetic information of an organism. With its amazing biological and polymeric characteristics, DNA has been regarded as a universal building block for the construction of diverse materials for real&#8208;world applications. Through various approaches including ligation, polymerization, chemical crosslinking, and physical crosslinking, both pure and hybrid DNA gels have been developed as generic materials. This Review discusses recent advances in the construction of DNA&#8208;based networks without considering any of DNA&#8242;s genetic properties. In addition, we highlight the biomedical and non&#8208;biomedical applications of DNA as generic materials.

&lt;p&gt;DNA is a true polymer that stores the genetic information of an organism. With its amazing biological and polymeric characteristics, DNA has been regarded as a universal building block for the construction of diverse materials for real-world applications. Through various approaches including ligation, polymerization, chemical crosslinking, and physical crosslinking, both pure and hybrid DNA gels have been developed as generic materials. This Review discusses recent advances in the construction of DNA-based networks without considering any of DNA&#8242;s genetic properties. In addition, we highlight the biomedical and non-biomedical applications of DNA as generic materials. Owing to the superb molecular recognition, self-assembly, and responsiveness of DNA, a mushrooming number of DNA materials with various properties have been developed for general utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
By using diazonaphthoquinones and anilines as key reagents and through a point&#8208;to&#8208;axis chiral transfer strategy, the atroposelective synthesis via asymmetric C(sp2)&#8722;H bond insertion reaction of arenes has been realized under rhodium catalysis, providing the resulting biaryl atropisomers in moderate to excellent yields with good enantiomeric ratios (up to 99:1).

         <title>Selective Catalytic Frustrated Lewis Pair Hydrogenation of CO2 in the Presence of Silylhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), 2,6&#8208;lutidine/ B(C6F5)3 mediates the catalytic reduction of CO2 using H2 and a silylhalide. Control of the silylhalide and solvent, affords selective avenues to the disilylacetal (R3SiOCH2OSiR3), methoxysilane (R3SiOCH3), methyliodide (CH3I) and methane (CH4) under mild conditions. The mechanism is studied by DFT and accounts for the observed selectivity.







Abstract
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) derived from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and B(C6F5)3 is shown to mediate the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 using H2 as the reductant and a silylhalide as an oxophile. The nature of the products can be controlled with the judicious selection of the silylhalide and the solvent. In this fashion, this metal&#8208;free catalysis affords avenues to the selective formation of the disilylacetal (R3SiOCH2OSiR3), methoxysilane (R3SiOCH3), methyliodide (CH3I) and methane (CH4) under mild conditions. DFT studies illuminate the complexities of the mechanism and account for the observed selectivity.

         <title>Inhibition Mechanism of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Ketone&#8208;Based Inhibitors Unveiled by Multiscale Simulations: Insights for Improved Designs**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale simulations unveil the binding and reaction mechanism of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231 inhibitor. This compound contains a hydroxymethyl group that plays a relevant role in the formation of the noncovalent and covalent complexes. In silico modifications show a possible strategy for the design of new inhibitors.







Abstract
We present the results of classical and QM/MM simulations for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CL protease by a hydroxymethylketone inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231. In the noncovalent complex the carbonyl oxygen atom of the warhead is placed in the oxyanion hole formed by residues 143 to 145, while P1&#8211;P3 groups are accommodated in the active site with interactions similar to those observed for the peptide substrate. According to alchemical free energy calculations, the P1&#8242; hydroxymethyl group also contributes to the binding free energy. Covalent inhibition of the enzyme is triggered by the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the S&#947; atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1&#8242; hydroxyl group. Computational simulations show that the addition of a chloromethyl substituent to the P1&#8242; group may lower the activation free energy for covalent inhibition

         <title>An Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Enhanced Li+ Transport Ability Enables Stable Li Deposition for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Li deposition in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is achieved through introducing hydrofluoroether to regulate the solvation environment of electrolyte to boost Li+ transport ability according to the Sand formula. The formation of sliced ionic aggregate lead to the improved transport parameters in Sand formula. The performance of Li&#8208;O2 battery is greatly improved thanks to the realized robust Li deposition behavior.







Abstract
Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte could endow Li&#8208;O2 batteries with low charging overpotential. However, their weak Li+ transport ability (LTA) leads to non&#8208;uniform Li deposition. Herein, guided by Sand formula, the LTA of TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is greatly enhanced to realize robust Li deposition through introducing hydrofluoroether (HFE) and optimizing electrolyte component ratios to regulate solvation environment. The solvation environment changes from Li(TFSI)2&#8722; ion pair into ionic aggregate clusters in the optimal electrolyte thanks to the slicing function of HFE toward ionic aggregate network. The transport parameters of Sand formula are synchronously enhanced, resulting in highly robust Li deposition behavior with greatly improved Coulombic efficiency (ca. 97.5&#8201;%) and cycling rate (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Cycling stability of Li&#8208;O2 batteries was greatly improved (a tiny overpotential rise of 64&#8197;mV after 75&#8197;cycles).

         <title>A Platform for Site&#8208;Specific DNA&#8208;Antibody Bioconjugation by Using Benzoylacrylic&#8208;Labelled Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BA&#8208;PFP is a simple and practical reagent that enables preparation of a range of diverse site&#8208;specific, homogenous DNA&#8208;protein/antibody bioconjugates under mild conditions. The generated constructs can be conveniently characterized by an optimized LC&#8208;MS method and utilized as probes for cell imaging using fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution DNA&#8208;PAINT microscopy.







Abstract
Many bioconjugation strategies for DNA oligonucleotides and antibodies suffer limitations, such as site&#8208;specificity, stoichiometry and hydrolytic instability of the conjugates, which makes them unsuitable for biological applications. Here, we report a new platform for the preparation of DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates with a simple benzoylacrylic acid pentafluorophenyl ester reagent. Benzoylacrylic&#8208;labelled oligonucleotides prepared with this reagent can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a range of proteins and antibodies through accessible cysteine residues. The homogeneity of the prepared DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates was confirmed by a new LC&#8208;MS protocol and the bioconjugate probes were used in fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution microscopy cell imaging experiments. This work demonstrates the versatility and robustness of our bioconjugation protocol that gives site&#8208;specific, well&#8208;defined and plasma&#8208;stable DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates for biological applications.

&lt;p&gt;BA-PFP is a simple and practical reagent that enables preparation of a range of diverse site-specific, homogenous DNA-protein/antibody bioconjugates under mild conditions. The generated constructs can be conveniently characterized by an optimized LC-MS method and utilized as probes for cell imaging using fluorescence or super-resolution DNA-PAINT microscopy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many bioconjugation strategies for DNA oligonucleotides and antibodies suffer limitations, such as site-specificity, stoichiometry and hydrolytic instability of the conjugates, which makes them unsuitable for biological applications. Here, we report a new platform for the preparation of DNA-antibody bioconjugates with a simple benzoylacrylic acid pentafluorophenyl ester reagent. Benzoylacrylic-labelled oligonucleotides prepared with this reagent can be site-specifically conjugated to a range of proteins and antibodies through accessible cysteine residues. The homogeneity of the prepared DNA-antibody bioconjugates was confirmed by a new LC-MS protocol and the bioconjugate probes were used in fluorescence or super-resolution microscopy cell imaging experiments. This work demonstrates the versatility and robustness of our bioconjugation protocol that gives site-specific, well-defined and plasma-stable DNA-antibody bioconjugates for biological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterizing the Conformational Distribution in an Amorphous Film of an Organic Emitter and Its Application in a &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Until now, the influence of the conformational distribution on the photophysics and device performance of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has not been clear. Herein, conformational populations in disordered solid states are quantitatively measured for the first time. A high&#8208;performance &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% is achieved.







Abstract
The conformational distribution and mutual interconversion of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters significantly affect the exciton utilization. However, their influence on the photophysics in amorphous film states is still not known due to the lack of a suitable quantitative analysis method. Herein, we used temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy to quantitatively measure the relative populations of the conformations of a TADF emitter for the first time. We further propose a new concept of &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; for realizing high&#8208;efficiency nondoped OLEDs. Interestingly, this &#8220;compositionally&#8221; pure film actually behaves as a film with a dopant (quasi&#8208;equatorial form) in a matrix (quasi&#8208;axial form). The concentration&#8208;induced quenching that may occur at high concentrations is thus expected to be effectively relieved. The &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED prepared with the newly developed TADF emitter TP2P&#8208;PXZ as a neat emitting layer realizes a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% and neglectable efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Noncovalent CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Phosphoramidite Palladium(II) Complexes with Strong Conformational Preference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a combined NMR and computational study of a supramolecular balance to quantify ligand&#8211;ligand interactions in metal complexes and induce high heterocomplex preferences. Noncovalent interaction areas of flexible chiral phosphoramidite ligands are identified in palladium complexes with high conformational stability. The combined CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
The weak noncovalent interactions and flexibility of ligands play a key role in enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In transition metal complexes and their catalytic applications, the experimental assessment and the design of key interactions is as difficult as the prediction of the enantioselectivities, especially for flexible, privileged ligands such as chiral phosphoramidites. Therefore, the interligand interactions in cis&#8208;PdIIL2Cl2 phosphoramidite complexes were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and computations. We were able to induce a strong conformational preference by breaking the symmetry of the C2&#8208;symmetric side chain of one of the ligands, and shift the equilibrium between hetero&#8208; and homocomplexes towards heterocomplexes because of interligand interactions in the cis&#8208;complexes. The modulation of aryl substituents was exploited, along with the solvent effect. The combined CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.

         <title>Copper Pairing in the Mordenite Framework as a Function of the CuI/CuII Speciation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As evidenced by advanced X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis, Cu&#8208;pairing in copper&#8208;exchanged mordenite is favored by the +2 oxidation state. The optimal Cu&#8211;Cu distance in the oxidized state favors the formation of dimeric mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper sites.







Abstract
A series of gas&#8208;phase reactants is used to treat a Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite zeolite with the aim of studying the influence of the reaction environment on the formation of Cu pairs. The rearrangement of Cu ions to form multimeric sites as a function of their oxidation state was probed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and also by applying advanced analysis through wavelet transform, a method able to specifically locate Cu&#8211;Cu interactions also in the presence of overlapping contributions from other scattering paths. The nature of the Cu&#8208;oxo species formed upon oxidation was further crosschecked by DFT&#8208;assisted fitting of the EXAFS data and by resonant Raman spectroscopy. Altogether, the CuI/CuII speciation clearly correlates with Cu proximity, with metal ion pairs quantitatively forming under an oxidative environment.

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Based Electron Donators to Stabilize and Activate Ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles for Efficient Hydrogen Atom Dissociation and Gas Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co/NC heterojunctions are used as &#8220;solid ligands&#8221; to control the growth of as&#8208;supported ultrafine Pt nanoparticles via donating electrons. Ultrafine Pt nanoparticles with enhanced electron density promotes the proton capture from electrolyte to catalyst surface, the dissociation of Pt&#8722;H bonds and successive release of H2 molecules from the Pt surface.







Abstract
Platinum (Pt) is the most effective bench&#8208;marked catalyst for producing renewable and clean hydrogen energy by electrochemical water splitting. There is demand for high HER catalytic activity to achieve efficient utilization and minimize the loading of Pt in catalysts. In this work, we significantly boost the HER mass activity of Pt nanoparticles in Ptx/Co to 8.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C by using Co/NC heterojunctions as a heterogeneous version of electron donors. The highly coupled interfaces between Co/NC and Pt metal enrich the electron density of Pt nanoparticles to facilitate the adsorption of H+, the dissociation of Pt&#8722;H bonds and H2 release, giving the lowest HER overpotential of 6.9&#8197;mV vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid among reported HER electrocatalysts. Given the easy scale&#8208;up synthesis due to the stabilization of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles by Co/NC solid ligands, Ptx/Co can even be a promising substitute for commercial Pt/C for practical applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Enzymatic Labeling Reveals a Critical Role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in Cell&#8208;Cycle Progression and DNA Damage Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A galactosyltransferase was engineered to covalently modify the O&#8208;GlcNAc glycan with a biotinylated sugar, allowing for the sensitive capture and profiling of cellular O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins. This strategy identifies flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) as a novel glycoprotein. O&#8208;GlcNAc glycosylation on FEN1 abolishes its interaction with PCNA during DNA replication, leading to aberrant cell&#8208;cycle progression and defects in DNA damage response.







Abstract
O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification of proteins that is essential for cell function. Perturbation of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation leads to altered cell&#8208;cycle progression and DNA damage response. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we develop a highly sensitive one&#8208;step enzymatic strategy for capture and profiling O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins in cells. Using this strategy, we discover that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), an essential enzyme in DNA synthesis, is a novel substrate for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation. FEN1 O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle. O&#8208;GlcNAcylation at the serine 352 of FEN1 disrupts its interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) at the replication foci, and leads to altered cell cycle, defects in DNA replication, accumulation of DNA damage, and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage agents. Thus, our study provides a sensitive method for profiling O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins, and reveals an unknown mechanism of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage response.

         <title>Development of Chiral Ligands for the Transition Metal&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective Silylation and Borylation of C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective reactions that install functional groups at the positions of unactivated C&#8208;H bonds can be envisioned to produce intermediates for the synthesis of the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals directly from simple feedstocks. Among these C&#8208;H bond functionalization reactions, those that form carbon&#8208;silicon (C&#8208;Si) and carbon&#8208;boron (C&#8208;B) bonds have been pursued because the products of these reactions can be converted to those containing a wide range of functional groups and because compounds containing silicon and boron possess unique properties that can be valuable for medicinal and materials chemistry. Although the silylation and borylation of C&#8208;H bonds have undergone extensive development during the past two decades, enantioselective versions of these reactions were not known until a few years ago. In this minireview, we present the rapid development of enantioselective silylation and borylation of C&#8208;H bonds, with an emphasis on the design and development of the types of chiral ligands needed to achieve these reactions and an intention to inspire an expansion of these types of transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Perovskite Quantum Dots as Absorber for Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) preserve the attractive properties of perovskite bulk materials and present additional advantages, owing to their quantum confinement effect, leading to their applicability as an absorber in perovskite solar cells. In this article, the issues and advantages of perovskite QDs are analyzed in terms of purification, device fabrication with perovskite QDs, light absorption, charge transport and stability. In addition, promising strategies to enhance perovskite QDs and QD&#8208;based solar cells are elucidated based on exchange chemistry (ion and ligand exchange), passivation engineering (ion and ligand passivation) and structure engineering (conventional/inverted, planar/mesoscopic and dimensionally graded structures). All these discussions will give a clue to the further development of perovskite QDs and thus the advancement of QD&#8208;based solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Truly&#8208;biocompatible gold catalysis enables vivo&#8208;orthogonal intra&#8208;CNS release of anxiolytics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Being recognized as the best&#8208;tolerated of all metals, the catalytic potential of gold (Au) has thus far been hindered by the ubiquitous presence of thiols in organisms. Herein we report the development of a truly&#8208;catalytic Au&#8208;polymer composite by assembling ultrasmall Au&#8208;nanoparticles at the protein&#8208;repelling outer layer of a co&#8208;polymer scaffold  via  electrostatic loading. Illustrating the  in vivo  &#8208;compatibility of the novel catalysts, we show their capacity to uncage&#160;the anxiolytic agent fluoxetine at the central nervous system (CNS) of developing zebrafish, influencing their swim pattern. This bioorthogonal strategy has enabled &#8213;for the first time&#8213; modification of cognitive activity by releasing a neuroactive agent directly in the brain of an animal.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying intracellular single vesicular catecholamine concentration with open carbon nanopipettes to unveil the effect of L&#8208;DOPA on vesicular structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of exocytosis is essential for uncovering the pathologies of neuronal disorders and developing related pharmaceuticals. In this work intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) measurements with different&#8208;sized (50&#8208;500 nm radius) open carbon nanopipettes (CNPs) were performed to quantify the vesicular content and release kinetics of specific vesicle populations grouped by orifice sizes. Intracellular vesicles with radius below 100 nm were captured and narrowed between 50 and 100 nm. On the basis of this, single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were quantified as 0.23&#8208;1.1 M. Our results with L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)&#8208;exposure indicate that L&#8208;DOPA regulates exocytosis by increasing the dense core size and vesicular content while catecholamine concentrations didn&#8217;t show obvious alterations. These were all achieved simultaneously and relatively noninvasively with open CNPs, and this methodology is applicable to the mechanistic study of the drugs in exocytosis modulation inside single cells as well as small living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable isotope phosphate labelling of diverse metabolites is enabled by a family of 18O&#8208;phosphoramidites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable isotope labelling is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in quantitative mass spectrometry, yet often accessing the required standards is cumbersome and very expensive. Here, a unifying synthetic concept for&#160;18O&#8208;labelled phosphates is presented, based on a family of modified&#160;18O2&#8209;phosphoramidite reagents. This toolbox offers access to major classes of biologically highly relevant phosphorylated metabolites as their isotopologues including nucleotides, inositol phosphates, &#8208;pyrophosphates, and inorganic polyphosphates.&#160;18O&#8208;enrichment ratios &gt;95% and good yields are obtained consistently in gram&#8208;scale reactions, while enabling late&#8208;stage labelling. We demonstrate the utility of the&#160;18O labelled inositol phosphates and pyrophosphates by assignment of these metabolites from different biological matrices. We demonstrate that phosphate neutral loss is negligible in an analytical setup employing capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which have widespread applications in many fields, in particular in the context of chemical biology and drug development. Here, we report the first investigation of FSO  2  radical generation under electrochemical conditions, and the establishment of a new and facile approach for the synthesis of  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides via oxo&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes with sulfuryl chlorofluoride as the radical precursor and air as the oxidant. This electrochemical protocol is amenable to access two different products (  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides or  &#945;  &#8208;chloro&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides) with the same reactants. The  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluoride products can be utilized as useful building blocks in the synthesis of various derivatives and heterocycles, including the first synthesis of an oxathiazole dioxide compound. Furthermore, some  &#946;  &#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives exhibited notably potent activities against  Bursaphelenchus xylophilus  and  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides  .</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8230;X Halogen Bond&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The halogen bond is the attractive interaction between the electrophilic region of a halogen atom and the nucleophilic region of another molecular entity, emerging as a favorable manner to manipulate supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assemblies.  Engineering halogen bonded helical structures remains major challenges due to its sensitivity to solvent polarity and competitive forces like hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a  X  &#8230;X (X = Cl, Br, I) type weak halogen bond that induces the formation and evolution of supramolecular helical structures both in solid and solution state. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated phenylalanine derivatives with F, Cl, Br and I substitution self&#8208;assembled into 2  1  helical packing driven by hydrogen bond and halogen bond respectively. The specific molecular geometries of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids gave rise to multiple noncovalent forces to stabilize the X&#8230;X halogen bond with small bond energies ranging from &#8208;0.69 to &#8208;1.49 kcal/mol. Halogen bond induced an opposite helicity compared to the fluorinated species, accompanied by the inversed circularly polarized luminescence. The halogen bond could further engineer the helical nanoarchitectures in the mono&#8208; and multiple&#8208;component coassemblies with melamine, providing a flexible protocol to prepare chiral functional materials. This work unveils the effect of weak X&#8230;X type halogen bonds on controlling supramolecular chirality in solid and solution state and offers a strategy to design halogenated chiral functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Singlet Carbenes as Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple experimental procedure for scaling carbene Br&#248;nsted basicity is described. The results highlight the strong basicity of pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbenes, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA). They are more basic (pK  a  &gt; 42.7 in acetonitrile) than the popular proazaphosphatrane Verkade bases, and even the Schwesinger phosphazene superbase P  4  (  t  Bu). The basicity of these compounds can readily be tuned, and they are accessible in multigram quantities. These results open new avenues for carbon centered superbases.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing the MXene by Hydration Chemistry in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes attract great interest in diverse fields but suffer from fast structural degradation by attacking of dissolved oxygen and water molecules in aqueous solution. This drawback fundamentally hinders the long&#8208;term storage, applications and understanding of the chemical nature of MXenes. Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally sustainable way for long&#8208;term storage of MXenes in aqueous solution by hydration chemistry of nontoxic inorganic salts with abundant reserve. The attacking of MXene by free water and dissolved oxygen molecules is effectively inhibited by decreasing the water activity, which simultaneously lowers the dissolved oxygen concertation, of saline solution. As a result, the storage life of MXene can be dramatically prolonged to up to 400 days at ambient conditions without loss of intrinsic surface chemistry and bulk carrier properties. Over 90 % of salt protectant can be recycled by simply evaporating the final waste liquor after fully extracting the MXene to minimize the waste discharge and processing cost. This work offers an immediately commercializable approach with high cost&#8208;effectiveness, processing sustainability and environmental benefit for extending the shelf life of MXenes.</dc:description>

         <title>A defective nanotube molecule of C552H496N24&#160;with pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 3&#8208;nm molecule comprised of a cylindrical core and cross&#8208;shaped rims was designed and synthesized by developing a modular synthetic route. By using a cyclic precursor from previous studies as a starting material, multiple carbazole units were installed at the rims of the defective cylinder. The defective cylinder was synthetically doped with two types of nitrogen atoms,&#160;  i.e.  , pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms, which resulted in solvatochromic shifts in fluorescence via charge&#8208;transfer interactions. The structure of the large, C  552  H  496  N  24  &#160;molecule was fully disclosed by crystallographic analyses, and the unique helical arrangement of nitrogen&#8208;doped cylinders in the crystal was revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes via Cooperative Cu and Ni Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a dual copper and nickel catalytic system with a silyl hydride source for promoting the linear selective hydroalkylation of vinylarenes. This carbon&#8211;carbon bond forming protocol is applied to couple a variety of functionalized vinylarenes together with alkyl halides applying a nickel(II) NNN pincer complex in the presence of an NHC&#8208;ligated copper catalyst. This combination allows for just a 1 mol% loading of the nickel catalyst leading to turnover numbers of up to 72. Over 40 examples are presented, including applications for pharmaceutical diversification. Labeling experiments demonstrated the regioselectivity of the reaction and revealed that the copper catalyst plays a crucial role in enhancing the rate for formation of the reactive linear alkyl nickel complex. Overall, the presented work provides a complimentary approach for hydroalkylation reactions, whilst providing preliminary mechanistic understandings of the cooperativity between the copper and nickel complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomaterials offer exciting properties and functionalities. However, their production and processing frequently involve complex methods, cumbersome equipments, harsh conditions and hazardous media. The capability of living beings to accomplish this purpose using mild conditions offers a sustainable, biocompatible and environmentally friendly alternative. Different nanomaterials such as metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, silica nanostructures or nanocellulose are increasingly being synthesized through living entities. Even more, the bionanofabrication potential enables also the in situ processing of nanomaterials inside biomatrices with unprecedented outcomes. The focus of this Minireview is to present a critical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vision of current nanofabrication approaches mediated by living entities (ranging from unicellular to higher organisms), in order to expand this knowledge and scrutinize future prospects. An efficient interfacial interaction at the nanoscale by green means is at reach through this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Aromaticity and Application of peri&#8208;PentacenoPentacene: Localized Representation of Benzenoid Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of TIPS&#8208;  peri  &#8208;pentacenopentacene (  TIPS&#8208;PPP  ), a vertical extension of TIPS&#8208;pentacene (  TIPS&#8208;PEN  ), a low band gap material with remarkable stability. We found the synthetic conditions to avoid the competition between 1,2 and 1,4&#8208;addition of lithium&#8208;acetylide on large aromatic dione. The high stability of  TIPS&#8208;PPP  is due to the  peri  &#8208;fusion which increases the aromaticity by generating two localized aromatic sextets that are flanked with 2 diene fragments similar to two fused&#8208;anthracenes. Like  TIPS&#8208;PEN  ,  TIPS&#8208;PPP  shows the archetypal 2D&#8208;brickwall motif in the crystals with stronger transfer integral and lower reorganization energies. The high mobility of up to 1 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  was obtained in OFET fabricated by wet process. Also,  TIPS&#8208;PPP  was used as a near&#8208;infrared emitter for NIR&#8208;OLED devices resulting in high external quantum efficiency at 800 nm. Based on literature data, NICS and the pattern of the HOMO molecular orbital, we highlight some key issues related to a localized representation of fused benzenoid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Trifluoromethylation Carbonylation of Unactivated Alkenes: Efficient Access to &#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel procedure on carbonylative trifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. Catalyzed by a copper catalyst, carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes with Togin&#8208;CF3 and nitrogen (or oxygen) nucleophiles occurred successfully. A variety of valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amides, esters and acid were obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Ethylene gas can also be successfully applied.







Abstract
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative trifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. A broad range of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated carboxylic acid derivatives were prepared in moderate to excellent yields from simple alkenes with excellent regioselectivity. It is noteworthy that ethylene gas, as the simplest olefin, can also be applied directly to obtain &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amides and ester. This transformation presents the first example on carbonylative trifluoromethylation of alkenes.

         <title>Biomimetic Recognition of Quinones in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity with Anthracene Sidewalls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new biomimetic host with anthracene sidewalls was constructed based on the concept of endo&#8208;functionalized cavity and by employing the synthetic strategy of simultaneous construction. This host is able to effectively bind quinones with high selectivity by employing shielded noncovalent interactions and the hydrophobic effect.







Abstract
Selective molecular recognition in water is the foundation of numerous biological functions but is a challenge for most synthetic hosts. We employ the concept of endo&#8208;functionalized cavity and the strategy of simultaneous construction to address this issue. The concept and the strategy were demonstrated in the construction of a biomimetic host for selectively recognizing quinones in water. The host was synthesized by joining two pieces of bent anthracene dimer through amide bond formation, affording a deep hydrophobic cavity and inward&#8208;directing hydrogen bonding sites. The host can recognize quinones over their close analogues in water, and its association affinity to p&#8208;benzoquinone is the highest among all the known hosts and is even comparable to that of the bioreceptor. The binding with an anthraquinone reaches nanomolar affinity. Shielded hydrogen bonding, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and charge transfer interactions, and the hydrophobic effect are responsible for the high binding affinity and selectivity.

A supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem that reprograms the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations is reported, achieving an efficient suppression of breast cancer.







Abstract
Incorporating multiple molecular interactions within a system to realize the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is prospected to be of great potential in cancer therapy. Herein, we report a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem, which reprogrammed the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations. In the nanosystem, amphipathic telluroether was coordinated with MnII to self&#8208;assemble into micelle, on which a siNrf2 integrated DNA network was assembled. The great electron&#8208;donating capability of telluroether was revealed to greatly promote MnII&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reaction to generate subversive .OH in cancer cells. In response to adenosine triphosphoric acid, the siNrf2 was specially released in cytoplasm for down&#8208;regulating expression of detoxification enzymes, which enhanced chemocatalysis&#8208;mediated oxidative stress in cancer cells, thus significantly suppressing tumor progression.

         <title>The Unusual Conductivity of Na+ in PEO&#8208;Based Statistical Copolymer Solid Electrolytes: When Less Means More</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid polymer electrolytes from synthesized statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were mixed with various amounts of NaClO4. Physical crosslinking with cations is more prone to happen at high contents in both salt and comonomers, reducing the ionic conductivity. Low salt content (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is thus preferred, contrasting with classical Nerstian behavior, leading to ionic conductivity of 0.2 10&#8208;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The low conductivity of Na+ electrolytes in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) curtails the development of Na polymer batteries. In this study, NaClO4 (3&#8211;24&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 90&#8211;9:1 O:Na) is dissolved in statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) (0&#8211;20&#8197;mol&#8201;%). Remarkably, the conductivity of these SPEs increases as the concentration of Na+ decreases, thus departing from the usual Nernstian behavior. Using a combination of calorimetric measurements and molecular dynamic simulations, this unusual phenomenon is attributed to the presence of physical cross&#8208;links generated by Na+. As a result, polymers containing a low salt concentration (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) display a drastically enhanced ionic conductivity (up to 0.2 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), thus paving the way for the design of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PEO&#8208;based sodium batteries operational at room temperature.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C2 alkylation of functionalized benzothiophenes has been explored. Enantiospecific C&#8722;C bond formation is achieved via O&#8208;activation and 1,2&#8208;metalate shift of benzothiophene S&#8208;oxide boronate complexes, which enables expedient access to chiral C2&#8208;alkylated benzothiophenes.







Abstract
Benzothiophenes are valuable heterocycles that are widely used in medicines, agrochemicals, and materials science. Herein, we report a general method for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzothiophenes via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C2&#8208;alkylation of benzothiophenes with boronic esters. The reactions utilize benzothiophene S&#8208;oxides in lithiation&#8208;borylations to generate intermediate arylboronate complexes, and subsequent Tf2O&#8208;promoted S&#8722;O bond cleavage to trigger a Pummerer&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;metalate shift, which gives the coupled products with complete enantiospecificity. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl boronic esters and aryl boronic esters are successfully coupled with a range of C3&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes. Importantly, this transformation does not require the use of C3 directing groups, therefore it overcomes a major limitation of previously developed transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated C2 alkylations of benzothiophenes.

         <title>A Solvatochromic Fluorescent Probe Reveals Polarity Heterogeneity upon Protein Aggregation in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization&#8208;induced&#8208;emission AggRetina probe serves as a fluorescent polarity ruler to dissect the enriched heterogeneity inside aggregated proteins.







Abstract
We report a crystallization&#8208;induced emission fluorophore to quantitatively interrogate the polarity of aggregated proteins. This solvatochromic probe, namely &#8220;AggRetina&#8221; probe, inherently binds to aggregated proteins and exhibits both a polarity&#8208;dependent fluorescence emission wavelength shift and a viscosity&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity increase. Regulation of its polarity sensitivity was achieved by extending the conjugation length. Different proteins bear diverse polarity upon aggregation, leading to different resistance to proteolysis. Polarity primarily decreases during protein misfolding but viscosity mainly increases upon the formation of insoluble aggregates. We quantified the polarity of aggregated protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest in live cells via HaloTag bioorthogonal labeling, revealing polarity heterogeneity within cellular aggregates. The enriched micro&#8208;environment details inside misfolded and aggregated proteins may correlate to their bio&#8208;chemical properties and pathogenicity.

         <title>Mechanical Enhancement and Kinetics Regulation of Fmoc&#8208;Diphenylalanine Hydrogels by Thioflavin&#8197;T</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioflavin&#8197;T dramatically enhances the structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel and drives the self&#8208;assembly by interfering the metastable phase of the two&#8208;step nucleation process.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of peptides is a key direction for fabrication of advanced materials. Novel approaches for fine tuning of macroscopic and microscopic properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies are of a high demand for constructing biomaterials with desired properties. In this work, while studying the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;Diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) dipeptide self&#8208;assembly using the Thioflavin&#8197;T (ThT) dye, we observed that the presence of ThT strongly modifies structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel. Notably, the presence of ThT resulted in a tenfold increase of the gelation time and in the formation of short and dense fibers in the hydrogel. As a result of these morphological alteration higher thermal stability, and most important, tenfold increase of the hydrogel rigidity was achieved. Hence, ThT not only slowed the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel formation, but also strongly enhanced its mechanical properties. In this study, we provide a detailed description of the ThT effect on the hydrogel properties and suggest the mechanisms for this phenomenon, paving the way for the novel approach to the control of the peptide hydrogels&#8217; micro&#8208; and macroscale properties.

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Sialylated Glycoforms of Human Erythropoietin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two glycoforms of human erythropoietin (EPO) were synthesized by sequential native chemical ligation combining chemical and enzymatic methods. The sialylated glycoform EPO&#8197;S was assembled stepwise from sialoglycopeptides but more rapidly by direct sialylation of the asialo glycoform EPO&#8197;A. The native fold was evident from CD spectra, HR&#8208;MS, and binding to the human EPO receptor (EPOR).







Abstract
Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is the main therapeutic glycoprotein for the treatment of anemia in cancer and kidney patients. The in&#8208;vivo activity of EPO is carbohydrate&#8208;dependent with the number of sialic acid residues regulating its circulatory half&#8208;life. EPO carries three N&#8208;glycans and thus obtaining pure glycoforms provides a major challenge. We have developed a robust and reproducible chemoenzymatic approach to glycoforms of EPO with and without sialic acids. EPO was assembled by sequential native chemical ligation of two peptide and three glycopeptide segments. The glycopeptides were obtained by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted Lansbury aspartylation. Enzymatic introduction of the sialic acids was readily accomplished at the level of the glycopeptide segments but even more efficiently on the refolded glycoprotein. Biological recognition of the synthetic EPOs was shown by formation of 1:1 complexes with recombinant EPO receptor.

         <title>Nickel(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring Expansion Toward Enantioenriched Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzosiloles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy for the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles in excellent yields and enantioselectivities enabled by a Ni0/chiral PR3&#8208;catalyst system. Moreover, preliminary studies on the chiroptical properties of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems, which were synthesized by the presented catalysis strategy, are also described.







Abstract
The development of a straightforward strategy to obtain enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles remains a challenging yet appealing synthesis venture due to their potential future application in chiral electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this context, all of the existing methods rely on Rh&#8208;catalyzed systems and are somewhat limited in scope. Herein, we disclose the first Ni0&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion process that enables the preparation of benzosiloles possessing tetraorganosilicon stereocenters in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The presented catalysis strategy is further applied to the asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems. Preliminary studies reveal that such compounds exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell structure based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) and upconversion nanoparticle is constructed by Tian&#8208;Fu Liu et&#8197;al. as described in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202110028). The upconversion nanoparticle &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared irradiation into visible light, which further excites the HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; to achieve photothermal and photodynamic bacterial inhibition. The cover picture by Bai&#8208;Tong Liu illustrates the structure behaving like the Chinese lantern, in which the core&#8211;shell configuration delivers brightness and happiness.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium nanoparticles catalyze the deuteration and tritiation of benzylic positions on complex molecules, as reported by Viktor Pfeifer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109043). In the picture, yellow diatomic molecules symbolize D2&#160;or T2&#160;gas, while the unlabeled molecular structures of celecoxib and UCB&#8208;J on the left and the identical labelled structures on the right with shining benzylic positions are shown to illustrate the hydrogen isotope exchange reaction.

A DNA molecular robot autonomously walking on the cell membrane to drive the cell motility has been developed. The DNA robot can autonomously and stepwise locomote on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner to simultaneously trigger the receptor dimerization to activate downstream signal pathway regulating desired cellular behavior, as reported by Hong&#8208;Hui Wang, Zhou Nie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108210).

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Specific Targeting of Ibrutinib: Introducing Electrostatic Antibody&#8208;Inhibitor Conjugates (AiCs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have significantly improved treatment of patients with different malignancies, but their utilization can be compromised by unintended toxicities. Ibrutinib is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class covalent inhibitor of the Bruton&#180;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom&#8217;s macroglobulinemia and is connected with toxicities, caused by high dosage. To minimize toxicities of ibrutinib we linked ibrutinib to a cell&#8208;targeted, internalizing antibody. To this end, we synthesized a poly&#8208;anionic derivate of ibrutinib, ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5 that retains full functionality. This anionic inhibitor is complexed by our anti&#8208;CD20&#8208;protamine targeting conjugate and free protamine and thereby spontaneously assembles into an electrostatically stabilized vesicular nanocarrier. The complexation led to an accumulation of the drug driven by the CD20 antigen internalization to the intended cells and an amplification of its physiological effectivity.  In vivo  , we observed a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and a significantly better response to significantly lower doses compared to the original untargeted drug  . This combination of a cell&#8208;determining antibody, electrostatically connected to a molecular targeted inhibitor defines a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibody&#8208;inhibitor conjugate.</dc:description>

         <title>The aryne phosphate reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensed phosphates are a critically important class of molecules in biochemistry, with a myriad of derived structures being known. Moreover, non&#8208;natural analogues are important for various applications, such as single molecule real time DNA sequencing. Often, such analogues contain more than three phosphate units in their oligophosphate chain. Consequently, investigations into phosphate reactivity enabling new ways of phosphate functionalization and oligophosphorylation are an essential endeavour in the field. Here, we scrutinize the potential of phosphates to act as arynophiles, paving the way for follow&#8208;up oligophosphorylation reactions. The aryne phosphate reaction is a powerful tool to &#8211; depending on the perspective &#8211; (oligo)phosphorylate arenes or arylate (oligo&#8208;cyclo)phosphates. Based on Kobayashi&#8208;type o&#8208;silylaryltriflates, the aryne phosphate reaction enables rapid entry into a broad spectrum of arylated products, like monophosphates, diphosphates, phosphodiesters and polyphosphates. The synthetic potential of these new transformations is demonstrated by efficient syntheses of nucleotide analogues and an unprecedented one&#8208;flask octaphosphorylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acidic PtIr Multipods Enable High&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics concomitant with the high overpotentials and parasitic reactions from cathodes and solvents is the major challenge in aprotic lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O  2  ) batteries. Designing efficient catalysts for accelerating oxygen reaction kinetics is critical to develop high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. Herein, the PtIr multipods with low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for improving overpotentials and stabilities. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that electrons have a strong disposition to transfer from Ir to Pt since Pt has higher electronegativity than Ir, resulting in lower Lewis acidity of Pt atoms than that on the pure Pt surface. The low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms on PtIr surface entails high electron density and down&#8208;shifting of d&#8208;band center, thereby weakening the binding energy towards the intermediates (LiO  2  ), which is the key in achieving low oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials. The Li&#8208;O  2  cell based on PtIr electrodes exhibits a very low discharge/charge overall overpotential of (0.44 V) and an excellent cycle life (180 cycles), outperforming the bulk of reported noble metal&#8208;based cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Phosphorus&#8208;Directed Borylation of C(sp2)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectacular progress has recently been achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H borylation of phosphines as well as directed electrophilic C&#8210;H borylation. As shown here, P&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation provides a new, straightforward, and efficient access to phosphine&#8208;boranes. It operates under metal&#8208;free conditions and leverages simple, readily available substrates. It is applicable to a broad range of backbones (naphthyl, biphenyl,  N  &#8208;phenylpyrrole, binaphthyl, benzyl, naphthylmethyl) and gives facile access to various substitution patterns at boron (by varying the boron electrophile or post&#8208;derivatizing the borane moiety). NMR monitoring supports the involvement of P&#8208;stabilized borenium cations as key intermediates. DFT calculations reveal the existence and stabilizing effect of &#960;&#8208;arene/boron interactions in the (biphenyl)(  i  &#8208;Pr)  2  P&#8594;BBr  2  +  species.</dc:description>

         <title>Transport of Molecular Cargo by Interaction with Virus&#8208;like Particle RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombinant virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) derived from  Leviviridae  virions contain substantial amounts of cellular and plasmid&#8208;derived RNA. This encapsidated polynucleotide serves as a reservoir for the efficient binding of the intercalating dye, thiazole orange (TO). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and oligopeptides of varying length, end&#8208;functionalized with TO, were rapidly captured by VLPs up to approximately 50% of the mass of the capsid protein (hundreds to thousands of cargo molecules per particle, depending on size). The kinetics of TO&#8208;PEG binding included a significant entropic cost for the reptation of long chains through the capsid pores. Cargo molecules were released over periods of 20&#8208;120 hours following simple reversible first&#8208;order kinetics in most cases. These observations define a simple and powerful method for the noncovalent packaging, and subsequent release, of functional molecules from nucleoprotein nanocages in a manner independent of modifications to the capsid protein.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthesis of functional 3D COFs with irreversible bond is challenging. Herein, 3D imide&#8208;bonded COFs were constructed via the imidization reaction between phthalocyanine&#8208;based tetraanhydride and 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantine. These two 3D COFs are made up of interpenetrated pts networks according to powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption analyses. CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 doped with carbon black has been employed to fabricate the electrocatalytic cathode towards CO2 reduction reaction within KHCO3 aqueous solution, displaying the Faradaic efficiency of 88&#8722;96% for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at the voltage range of &#8722;0.60~&#8722;1.00 V (vs. RHE). In particular, the 3D porous structure of CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;3 enables the active electrocatalytic centers occupying 32.7% of total cobalt&#8208;phthalocyanine subunits, thus giving a large current density (jCO) of &#8722;31.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.90 V. These two parameters are significantly improved than the excellent 2D COF analogue (CoPc&#8208;PI&#8208;COF&#8208;1, 5.1%&amp;21.2 mA).</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Access to 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutylboronic Esters by Consecutive Radical Additions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach to substituted cyclobutylboronic esters is described. It proceeds by successive intermolecular radical additions of xanthates to pinacolato 1&#8208;cyclobutenylboronate and to pinacolato bicyclo[1.1.0]but&#8208;1&#8208;ylboronate. Success hinges on tuning the stability of the &#945;&#8208;boryl radical by exploiting the stabilizing influence of the trivalent boronic ester and the slightly destabilizing cyclobutane, which increases the &#963;&#8208;character of the radical. Reductive removal of the xanthate group finally provides a range of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters. The contrast with cyclopropylboronic esters is striking, since the strong destabilization by the highly strained cyclopropane ring allows the first radical addition to take place but not the second. Furthermore, the first adducts are geminal xanthyl boronic esters that can be converted into cyclobutanones. This chemistry furnishes cyclobutylboronic esters that would be quite difficult to obtain otherwise and thus complements existing methods.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, exploited by Nature to lock three&#8208;dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of protocols able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists to exploit their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methodologies reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional protocols that are expected to come in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic gem&#8208;Difluoroolefination Reactions by a Formal C&#8209;H Functionalization/Defluorination Reaction with Diazoacetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photolysis of diazoalkanes to conduct singlet carbene transfer reactions of colored diazoalkanes has recently attracted significant interest in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a photocatalytic approach that allows the access of triplet carbene intermediates via energy transfer to conduct highly efficient gemdifluoroolefination reactions with  &#945;  &#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. The use of a tertiary amines proved pivotal to unlock this unusual reaction pathway and to prevent undesired cyclopropanation pathways. The amine further facilitates the ultimate abstraction of fluoride to yield gem&#8208;difluoroolefins (43&#160;examples, up to 88% yield), which is supported by experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies. We explored this synthesis method with a broad substrate scope, ranging from simple olefins and heterocyclic olefins towards the decoration of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Structure of Atomically Dispersed Zn Electrocatalyst by Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurately regulating the selectivity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization but challenging. Herein, a flexible alteration of oxygen reduction pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity oxygen reduction can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O, C coordinated (ZnO  3  C) or N coordinated (ZnN  4  ) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOFs precursors. The coordination environment of as&#8208;prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN  4  catalyst processes a 4e  &#8208;  pathway ORR to generate H  2  O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO  3  C catalyst with unique O, C coordination processes a 2e  &#8208;  pathway oxygen reduction to generate H  2  O  2  with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1 M KOH. Density functional theory calculations manifests that the decreased electron attribution around Zn in ZnO  3  C lower shifts the d&#8208;band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2e  &#8208;  ORR. In virtue of the structure merits of MOFs, this work rationally designed and synthesized single Zn atoms with varied coordination environment towards different oxygen reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined precursor engineering and grain anchoring leading to MA&#8208;free, phase&#8208;pure and stable &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide perovskites for efficient solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) has become one of the most promising candidate materials for high&#8208;efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to their outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we first report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare MA&#8208;free and phase&#8208;pure stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. Engineering the precursor solutions by incorporating volatile FA&#8208;based additives completely suppresses the formation of non&#8208;perovskite &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;&#8208;phase are anchored together and stabilized by permeating 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzylammonium iodide into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21% for FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which is among one of the highest values to date. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained ~90% of their initial efficiency after storing at 50 &#176;C for over 1600 hours. These findings should open new routes towards fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinone Covalent Organic Frameworks Hollow Tubes as Binder Micro&#8208;Additives in Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of new application&#8208;forms of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in Li&#8208;S batteries that can overcome the drawbacks like low&#8208;conductivity or high loading when typically applied as sulfur host&#8208;materials (mostly ~20 to ~40 wt% loading in cathode) is desirable to maximize their low&#8208;density advantage to obtain lightweight, portable or high energy&#8208;density devices. Here, we establish that COFs could have implications as micro&#8208;additives of binders (~1 wt% in cathode), and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow&#8208;tubes have been prepared as model micro&#8208;additives. The micro&#8208;additives can strengthen the basic properties of binder and spontaneously immobilize and catalytically convert lithium&#8208;polysulfides as proved by the density functional calculations, thus showing almost doubly enhanced reversible capacity compared with that of the bare electrode. Correlating the COFs with their high functionality and porosity, as well as their new application&#8208;forms of micro&#8208;additives with boosted performances, could provide new insights to conquer the fundamental challenges in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photoinitiated  anti  &#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes using SF  5  Cl and (TMS)  3  SiH as the hydrogen atom donor is reported.

         <title>Precise Spatial Designed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Energy Transfer and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiency photocatalysis in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and MOF nanosheets (NSs) are often limited by their short&#8208;lived charge separation as well as self&#8208;quenching. Here, we propose to use the energy transfer process (EnT) to elongate the charge separation, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of a series of MOF NSs. With the use of NS, the photocatalyst can also be well isolated to reduce the self&#8208;quenching. Tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H  4  TCPP) and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8209;benzoic acid)pyrene (H  4  TBAPy) linkers were chosen as the acceptor and donor moieties respectively. Accounting for the precise spatial design afforded by the MOF NSs, these donor and acceptor moieties could be closely positioned on the NSs, allowing for an efficient EnT process, as well as high degree of site isolation. Two templates, the donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor&#8208;NS, and the acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor&#8208;NS catalysts were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to their site&#8208;isolated active photocatalysts.

         <title>Fluorination Triggers Fluoroalkylation: Nucleophilic Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation with DBBF and CsF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation reaction has long remained a challenging task. We now report the use of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) as a practical reagent for perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylation reactions for the first time. Through a consecutive triple&#8208;fluorination process with DBBF and CsF, the (CF  3  )  3  C  &#8722;  species can be liberated and observed, which is able to serve as a robust nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylating agent for various electrophiles. The power of this synthetic protocol is evidenced by the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse perfluoro  tert  &#8208;butylated molecules. Multiple applications demonstrate the practicability of this method, as well as the superiority of perfluoro  tert  &#8208;butylated compounds as sensitive probes. The perfluoro&#8208;  tert  butylated product  3t  was successfully applied in  1  H&#8208; and  19  Fmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment with an ultra&#8208;low field (ULF) MRI system.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Sialyl N&#8208;Glycans and Analysis of Their Recognition by Neuraminidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24686-24693, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two biantennary N&#8208;glycans with asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialic acid groups were synthesized through a convergent approach that also enabled the first chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan (see scheme). The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan has been achieved for the first time by using the diacetyl strategy, in which NHAc is protected as NAc2 to improve reactivity by preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Another key was the glycosylation to the branched mannose in an ether solvent, which promoted the desired glycosylation by stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Furthermore, high &#945;&#8208;selectivity of these glycosylation reactions was realized by utilizing remote participation. Two asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialyl N&#8208;glycans were also synthesized by the same strategy. The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition. The asymmetrically deuterated N&#8208;glycans revealed a difference in the recognition of sialic acid on each branch. Meanwhile, the tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan was used to evaluate the effects of multivalency and steric hinderance by forming branching structures.

         <title>Coupling Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Oxidation over Carbon Cloth with Hydrogen Evolution Reaction for Nitrate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24605-24611, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) removal from exhaust is necessary because it presents an environmental concern. Previously reported techniques for NO removal are non&#8208;economical and do not utilize NO waste. NO electrocatalytic oxidation served as the anode substitution reaction. Over a piece of carbon cloth, NO elimination, sustainable nitrate synthesis, and hydrogen production were achieved electrocatalytically.







Abstract
NO is a harmful pollutant to the environment. The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and sacrifice of value&#8208;added chemicals. Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma&#8208;treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as a promising anode substitution reaction to couple with the hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen&#8208;containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V were applied to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.

         <title>Siloxy Esters as Traceless Activators of Carboxylic Acids: Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Aldol Reaction**
</title>

We developed a chiral boron&#8208;catalyzed, carboxylic acid&#8208;selective asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates at late stages for the first time. Computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and stereoselectivity through Si/B enediolates acting as the active species.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction is among the most useful reactions in organic synthesis. Despite the existence of many prominent reports, however, the late&#8208;stage, chemoselective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction of multifunctional substrates is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we identified that in situ pre&#8208;conversion of carboxylic acids to siloxy esters facilitated the boron&#8208;catalyzed direct aldol reaction, leading to the development of carboxylic acid&#8208;selective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates. Combining experimental and computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and led to the proposal of Si/B enediolates as the active species. The silyl ester formation facilitated both enolization and catalyst turnover by acidifying the &#945;&#8208;proton of substrates and attenuating poisonous Lewis bases to the boron catalyst.

         <title>Activation of Aryl Carboxylic Acids by Diboron Reagents towards Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24510-24518, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been established. B2cat2 serves as a borylating agent, but also activates the carboxylic acid substrate towards decarbonylative coupling, playing a dual role in this reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals that the reaction proceeds through a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B2cat2 has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni&#8208;catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni0 catalysts. The key to achieve this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of B2cat2 as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8722;O bond to Ni0 catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product.

&lt;p&gt;A Ni-catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl carboxylic acids with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been established. B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as a borylating agent, but also activates the carboxylic acid substrate towards decarbonylative coupling, playing a dual role in this reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals that the reaction proceeds through a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ni-catalyzed decarbonylative borylation of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been achieved without recourse to any additives. This Ni-catalyzed method exhibits a broad substrate scope covering poorly reactive non-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids, and tolerates diverse functional groups including some of the groups active to Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; catalysts. The key to achieve this decarbonylative borylation reaction is the choice of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a coupling partner that not only acts as a borylating reagent, but also chemoselectively activates aryl carboxylic acids towards oxidative addition of their C(acyl)&#8722;O bond to Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst via the formation of acyloxyboron compounds. A combination of experimental and computational studies reveals a detailed plausible mechanism for this reaction system, which involves a hitherto unknown concerted decarbonylation and reductive elimination step that generates the aryl boronic ester product. This mode of boron-promoted carboxylic acid activation is also applicable to other types of reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Anionic Pathway in the Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Ethers</title>

Assessment of the rich co&#8208;complexation chemistry of Ni(COD)2 and PhLi has led to a new family of structurally diverse lithium nickelates being uncovered. Combined stoichiometric, catalytic, and kinetic studies reveal that these hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes may be the key intermediates that facilitate the smooth C&#8722;O bond cleavage and cross&#8208;coupling of aryl ethers under mild conditions.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl ethers is a powerful method to forge new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. However, the inert C(sp2)&#8722;O bond means that a canonical mechanism that relies on the oxidative addition of the aryl ether to a Ni0 centre is thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable, which suggests that alternative mechanisms may be involved. Here, we provide spectroscopic and structural insights into the anionic pathway, which relies on the formation of electron&#8208;rich hetero&#8208;bimetallic nickelates by adding organometallic nucleophiles to a Ni0 centre. Assessing the rich co&#8208;complexation chemistry between Ni(COD)2 and PhLi has led to the structures and solution&#8208;state chemistry of a diverse family of catalytically competent lithium nickelates being unveiled. In addition, we demonstrate dramatic solvent and donor effects, which suggest that the cooperative activation of the aryl ether substrate by Ni0&#8208;ate complexes plays a key role in the catalytic cycle.

Grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites are coupled into single fusion crystals without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, thermal energy transfer within the CNF aggregate is significantly improved.







Abstract
Crystallites form a grain boundary or the inter&#8208;crystallite interface. A grain boundary is a structural defect that hinders the efficient directional transfer of mechanical stress or thermal phonons in crystal aggregates. We observed that grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites were coupled into single fusion crystals, without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, the lowered crystallinity of CNFs, which has been considered irreversible, was recovered, and the thermal energy transfer in the aggregate was significantly improved. Other nanofibrous crystallites of chitin also showed a similar fusion phenomenon by enhancing the inter&#8208;crystallite interactions. Such crystallite fusion may naturally occur in biological structures with network skeletons of aggregated fibrillar crystallites having mechanical or thermal functions.

         <title>Unexpected Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids Provide Insight into the Mechanisms of CYP152 Peroxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24694-24701, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of a cis or trans C&#945;=C&#946; double bond in unsaturated fatty acid substrates dramatically changes the catalytic efficiency and chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity of three representative CYP152 peroxygenases including OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, and P450BS&#946;, which provides new insights into their unusual catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
CYP152 peroxygenases catalyze decarboxylation and hydroxylation of fatty acids using H2O2 as cofactor. To understand the molecular basis for the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of these unique P450 enzymes, we analyze the activities of three CYP152 peroxygenases (OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, P450BS&#946;) towards cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;dodecenoic acids as substrate probes. The unexpected 6S&#8208;hydroxylation of the trans&#8208;isomer and 4R&#8208;hydroxylation of the cis&#8208;isomer by OleTJE, and molecular docking results suggest that the unprecedented selectivity is due to OleTJE&#8217;s preference of C2&#8722;C3 cis&#8208;configuration. In addition to the common epoxide products, undecanal is the unexpected major product of P450SP&#945; and P450BS&#946; regardless of the cis/trans&#8208;configuration of substrates. The combined H218O2 tracing experiments, MD simulations, and QM/MM calculations unravel an unusual mechanism for Compound&#8197;I&#8208;mediated aldehyde formation in which the active site water derived from H2O2 activation is involved in the generation of a four&#8208;membered ring lactone intermediate. These findings provide new insights into the unusual mechanisms of CYP152 peroxygenases.

         <title>Atomic Cation&#8208;Vacancy Engineering of NiFe&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxides for Improved Activity and Stability towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24612-24619, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal dissolution induced by lattice distortions was found to be responsible for the activity degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER. This degradation could be suppressed by introducing atomic cation vacancies in the LDH basal plane. Cation vacancy engineering strengthened the binding energy between metal cations and oxygen in the LDH layers and reduced lattice distortions, thereby enhancing catalyst stability and promoting active phase &#947;&#8208;(NiFe)OOH evolution during OER.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) are among the most active catalysts developed to date for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, though their long&#8208;term OER stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we reveal that the stability degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER results from a decreased number of active sites and undesirable phase segregation to form NiOOH and FeOOH, with metal dissolution underpinning both of these deactivation mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of cation&#8208;vacancies in the basal plane of NiFe LDH is an effective approach for achieving both high catalyst activity and stability during OER. The strengthened binding energy between the metals and oxygen in the LDH sheets, together with reduced lattice distortions, both realized by the rational introduction of cation vacancies, drastically mitigate metal dissolution from NiFe&#8208;LDH under high oxidation potentials, resulting in the improved long&#8208;term OER stability. In addition, the cation vacancies (especially M3+ vacancies) accelerate the evolution of surface &#947;&#8208;(NiFe)OOH phases, thereby boosting the OER activity. The present study highlights that tailoring atomic cation&#8208;vacancies is an important strategy for the development of active and stable OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tuneable Time Delay in the Burst Release from Oxidation&#8208;Sensitive Polymersomes Made by PISA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24716-24723, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes made by PISA based on thioether&#8208;functionalized polymers as membrane&#8208;forming block show a spontaneous membrane destabilization once a critical degree of oxidation is reached. Fine&#8208;tuning of the degradation time can be performed either by adjusting the membrane thickness or by partial pre&#8208;oxidation and can be further exploited to tailor the burst release of encapsulated dyes or enzymes in the presence of specific triggers.







Abstract
Reactive polymersomes represent a versatile artificial cargo carrier system that can facilitate an immediate release in response to a specific stimulus. The herein presented oxidation&#8208;sensitive polymersomes feature a time&#8208;delayed release mechanism in an oxidative environment, which can be precisely adjusted by either tuning the membrane thickness or partial pre&#8208;oxidation. These polymeric vesicles are conveniently prepared by PISA allowing the straightforward and effective in situ encapsulation of cargo molecules, as shown for dyes and enzymes. Kinetic studies revealed a critical degree of oxidation causing the destabilization of the membrane, while no release of the cargo is observed beforehand. The encapsulation of glucose oxidase directly transforms these polymersomes into glucose&#8208;sensitive vesicles, as small molecules including sugars can passively penetrate their membrane. Considering the ease of preparation, these polymersomes represent a versatile platform for the confinement and burst release of cargo molecules after a precisely adjustable time span in the presence of specific triggers, such as H2O2 or glucose.

         <title>Laterally Engineering Lanthanide&#8208;MOFs Epitaxial Heterostructures for Spatially Resolved Planar 2D Photonic Barcoding</title>

Dimension&#8208;tunable lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures were realized through spatial semi&#8208;confinement induced steric hindrance. They exhibit domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors and identifiable dimensional&#8208;tunable lengths, offering unique opportunities to design integrated microstructures and smart devices toward advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) heterostructures with domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors have shown great potential for achieving high&#8208;throughput sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeit and information security. Here, a strategy based on steric&#8208;hindrance effect is proposed to construct lateral lanthanide&#8208;MOFs (Ln&#8208;MOFs) epitaxial heterostructures, where the channel&#8208;directed guest molecules are introduced to rebalance in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth rates of the Ln&#8208;MOFs microrods and eventually generate lateral MOF epitaxial heterostructures with controllable aspect ratios. A library of lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures are acquired through a stepwise epitaxial growth procedure, from which rational modulation of each domain with specific lanthanide doping species allows for definition of photonic barcodes in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) domain with remarkably enlarged encoding capacity. The results provide molecular&#8208;level insight into the use of modulators in governing crystallite morphology for spatially assembling multifunctional heterostructures.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (C&#8208;FRET) for Efficient Chirality Transmission within an Intermolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24549-24557, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) transmission is a critical challenge in chiroptical research but there are two questions on CPL transmission. How to transfer CPL within intermolecular systems? And can achiral emitters emit CPL? We find the CPL transmission is critically dependent on the resonance transfer, which was attributed to unique circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET).







Abstract
The occurrence and transmission of chirality is a fascinating characteristic of nature. However, the intermolecular transmission efficiency of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging due to poor through&#8208;space energy transfer. We report a unique CPL transmission from inducing the achiral acceptor to emit CPL within a specific liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based intermolecular system through a circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET), wherein the luminescent cholesteric LC is employed as the chirality donor, and rationally designed achiral long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore acts as the well&#8208;assembled acceptor. In contrast to photon&#8208;release&#8208;and&#8208;absorption, the chirality transmission channel of C&#8208;FRET is highly dependent upon the energy resonance in the highly intrinsic chiral assembly of cholesteric LC, as verified by deliberately separating the achiral acceptor from the chiral donor to keep it far beyond the resonance distance. This C&#8208;FRET mode provides a de&#8197;novo strategy concept for high&#8208;level information processing for applications such as high&#8208;density data storage, combinatorial logic calculation, and multilevel data encryption and decryption.

A ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with excellent ion transport capability and stable interface chemistry is developed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability and superior performances of solid&#8208;state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/lithium metal batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C. The ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism is identified by solid&#8208;state NMR.







Abstract
Severe interfacial side reactions of polymer electrolyte with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode and Li metal anode restrict the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries. Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which enables the solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries to cycle 1500 times. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), greatly enhancing its electrochemical stability and suppressing the side reactions. We identify the ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior via solid&#8208;state NMR. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid&#8208;state batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C.

Compatibility was enabled by fine tuning the achiral carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst in the presence of chiral peptidic squaramide. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by stereoselective synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of medicinally related molecules, including U.S. FDA approved drug Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein we report an organocatalytic enantioselective functionalization of heterocyclic carboxaldehydes via the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction. Through careful pairing of novel squaramide and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, our method tolerates a breadth of heterocycles, enabling preparation of a series of heterocycle conjugated &#946;&#8208;(tetrahydro)carbolines in good yield and enantioselectivity. Careful selection of carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst is essential for toleration of a variety of regioisomeric heterocycles. Utility is demonstrated via the three&#8208;step stereoselective preparation of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of potent selective estrogen receptor downregulator and U.S. FDA approved drug Tadalafil.

         <title>Identifying the Evolution of Selenium&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Modulated MoSe2 Precatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Chemistry</title>

SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 was synthesized via a scalable salt&#8208;templated approach and investigated as a precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. MoSeS was identified as the actual electrocatalyst, which promoted conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S. When assembled into a battery, an impressive performance was observed, even with an elevated sulfur loading (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with a low electrolyte usage (4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S).







Abstract
Witnessing compositional evolution and identifying the catalytically active moiety of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in Li&#8211;S chemistry. Nevertheless, this field remains elusive. We report the scalable salt&#8208;templated synthesis of Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;incorporated MoSe2 architecture (SeVs&#8208;MoSe2) and reveal the phase evolution of the defective precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 to MoSeS. Furthermore, operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. The Li&#8211;S battery accordingly exhibits a satisfactory rate and cycling capability even with and elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2; 4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S). This work elucidates the design strategies and catalytic mechanisms of efficient electrocatalysts bearing defects.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Reveals Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24534-24542, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell mass spectrometric method based on a dielectric barrier discharge ionization source was used to analyze multiple metabolites in different cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) at the single&#8208;cell level with a throughput of around 38 cells per minute.







Abstract
Even populations of clonal cells are heterogeneous, which requires high&#8208;throughput analysis methods with single&#8208;cell sensitivity. Here, we propose a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell analytical method based on active capillary dielectric barrier discharge ionization mass spectrometry, which can analyze multiple metabolites in single cells at a rate of 38 cells/minute. Multiple cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) were discriminated successfully. We found evidence for abnormal lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells. We also analyzed gene expression in a cancer genome atlas dataset and found that the mRNA level of a critical enzyme of lipid synthesis (ATP citrate lyase, ACLY) was upregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Moreover, both an ACLY chemical inhibitor and a siRNA approach targeting ACLY could suppress the viability of PDAC cells. A significant reduction in lipid content in treated cells indicates that ACLY could be a potential target for treating pancreatic cancer.

Old reagent with a new use: Vinyl magnesium bromide, a widely used Grignard reagent, can be oxygenated with O2 to give a magnesium enolate intermediate. This enables a four&#8208;component reaction that efficiently converts chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine into a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step.







Abstract
An O2&#8208;assisted, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeds by oxygenation of vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;I) with O2 (component&#8208;II) to give a magnesium enolate of acetaldehyde, which undergoes addition to a chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine (component&#8208;III) followed by a sequential addition with excess vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;IV). The approach allows diastereoselective synthesis of anti/syn&#8208; and syn/syn&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diols in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The method was illustrated in an efficient, four&#8208;step synthesis of piperidine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;ethylnorlobelol.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bound Dense Micelle Brush Supports for Continuous Flow Catalysis</title>

Forest&#8208;like micellar brushes fabricated under an ambient environment in glass capillaries enable flexible decoration of various nanocatalysts and subsequently permit a broad range of continuous flow transformations. Notably, this strategy is feasible for short and long capillaries, allowing the preparation of flow reactors with significantly higher throughput.







Abstract
Flow reactors are appealing alternatives to conventional batch reactors for heterogeneous catalysis. However, it remains a key challenge to firmly immobilize the catalysts in a facile and flexible manner and to simultaneously maintain a high catalytic efficiency and throughput. Herein, we introduce a dense cylindrical micelle brush support in glass capillary flow reactors through a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly process initiated by pre&#8208;immobilized short micelle seeds. The active hairy corona of these micellar brushes allows the flexible decoration of a diverse array of nanocatalysts, either through a direct capture process or an in&#8197;situ growth method. The resulting flow reactors reveal excellent catalytic efficiency for a broad range of frequently utilized transformations, including organic reductions, Suzuki couplings, photolytic degradations, and multistep cascade reactions, and the system was both recyclable and durable. Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.

Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Covalently attaching photoacids and photobases to the surface of a polymer makes it possible to change the concentration of protons and hydroxides within the polymer upon irradiation with light. Such a change in charge carriers results in a light&#8208;modulated increase in the ionic conductivity across the polymer.







Abstract
Light is a convenient source of energy and the heart of light&#8208;harvesting natural systems and devices. Here, we show light&#8208;modulation of both the chemical nature and ionic charge carrier concentration within a protein&#8208;based biopolymer that was covalently functionalized with photoacids or photobases. We explore the capability of the biopolymer&#8208;tethered photoacids and photobases to undergo excited&#8208;state proton transfer and capture, respectively. Electrical measurements show that both the photoacid&#8208; and photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymers exhibit an impressive light&#8208;modulated increase in ionic conductivity. Whereas cationic protons are the charge carriers for the photoacid&#8208;functionalized biopolymer, water&#8208;derived anionic hydroxides are the suggested charge carriers for the photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymer. Our work introduces a versatile toolbox to photomodulate both protons and hydroxides as charge carriers in polymers, which can be of interest for a variety of applications.

         <title>Reversible Dissociation of a Dialumene**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24702-24708, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly trans&#8208;bent dialumene has marginal Al=Al double&#8208;bond character and, in solution, can dissociate into monomeric aluminyl fragments. Reactivity studies reveal that both the dialuminene and aluminyl monomer can be trapped by varying the reaction partner. DFT calculations elaborate the origins of the extreme trans&#8208;bending, weak Al=Al bond, and define substituent effects in dialumenes.







Abstract
Dialumenes are neutral AlI compounds with Al=Al multiple bonds. We report the isolation of an amidophosphine&#8208;supported dialumene. Our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational DFT analyses reveal a long and extreme trans&#8208;bent Al=Al bond with a low dissociation energy and bond order. In solution, the dialumene can dissociate into monomeric AlI species. Reactivity studies reveal two modes of reaction: as dialumene or as aluminyl monomers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Frequency Fingerprint for Ion Interaction Networks in a Confined Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24582-24587, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced frequency spectral method was developed for the qualitative and spectral analysis of the ion interaction networks inside a nanopore. This method decodes the frequency fingerprint from the highly noisy ionic current trace, which achieves classification, characterization, and prediction of the ion interaction networks inside a nanopore.







Abstract
The transport of molecules and ions through biological nanopores is governed by interaction networks among restricted ions, transported molecules, and residue moieties at pore inner walls. However, identification of such weak ion fluctuations from only few tens of ions inside nanopore is hard to achieve owing to electrochemical measurement limitations. Here, we developed an advanced frequency method to achieve qualitative and spectral analysis of ion interaction networks inside a nanopore. The peak frequency fm reveals the dissociation rate between nanopore and ions; the peak amplitude am depicts the amount of combined ions with the nanopore after interaction equilibrium. A mathematical model for single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint achieved the prediction of interaction characteristics of mutant nanopores. This single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint is important for classification, characterization, and prediction of synergetic interaction networks inside nanoconfinement.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Splicing Strategy for Constructing a Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for UDP&#8208;Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24566-24572, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (HHC) for UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) was developed using a &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy. HHC could be used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals. In addition, it could be used to evaluate the bile excretion function and as a high&#8208;throughput screening tool for the rapid discovery of potential UGT1A1 inhibitors.







Abstract
UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for the clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity and on&#8211;off or blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy to construct a highly selective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, HHC, for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720&#8197;nm after UGT1A1 metabolism. HHC was then successfully used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform&#8208;specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high&#8208;throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function.

         <title>Naphthodithiophene Diimide Based Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanopillar Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24543-24548, November 8, 2021. </description>

Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanopillar molecules based on naphthodithiophene diimide feature rigid pillar shapes along with a wealth of unique optical and chiral properties, which render them ideal building blocks for constructing important two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
The synthesis, structures, and properties of [4]cyclonaphthodithiophene diimides ([4]C&#8208;NDTIs) are described. NDTIs as important n&#8208;type building blocks were catenated in the &#945;&#8208;positions of thiophene rings via an unusual electrochemical&#8208;oxidation&#8208;promoted macrocyclization route. The thiophene&#8211;thiophene junction in [4]C&#8208;NDTIs results in an ideal pillar shape. This interesting topology, along with appealing electronic and optical properties inherited from the NDTI units, endows the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs with both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorptions, strong excitonic coupling, and tight encapsulation of C60. Stable orientations of the NDTI units in the nanopillars lead to stable inherent chirality, which enables detailed circular dichroism studies on the impact of isomeric structures on &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Remarkably, the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs maintain the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking abilities of NDTI units and thus adopt two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lattice arrays at the molecular level. These nanopillar molecules have great potential to mimic natural photosynthetic systems for the development of multifunctional organic materials.

Remarkably, the [4]C-NDTIs maintain the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking abilities of NDTI units and thus adopt two-dimensional (2D) lattice arrays at the molecular level. These nanopillar molecules have great potential to mimic natural photosynthetic systems for the development of multifunctional organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid Chelator that Can Remove Cu2+ from Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides and Stop the Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species Associated with Alzheimer's Disease</title>

         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;chelation from amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide complexes is a known approach towards the development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Herein we describe a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that removes Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn, forming the thermodynamically stable Cu&#8211;chelator complex, and by this enables the inhibition of ROS production in a reducing environment at physiological pH.







Abstract
Cu bound to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides can act as a catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuropathologic degradation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An excellent therapeutic approach is to use a chelator that can selectively remove Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946;. This chelator should compete with Zn2+ ions (Zn) that are present in the synaptic cleft while forming a nontoxic Cu complex. Herein we describe P3, a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that selectively removes Cu2+ from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn and prevent the formation of ROS even in a reductive environment. We demonstrate, based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, that although P3 extracts Zn from Cu,Zn&#8211;A&#946; faster than it removes Cu, the formed Zn complexes are kinetic products that further dissociate, while CuP3 is formed as an exclusive stable thermodynamic product. Our unique findings, combined with the bioavailability of peptoids, make P3 an excellent drug candidate in the context of AD.

         <title>High&#8208;Performant All&#8208;Organic Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by PTCDA Electrodes and a Hybrid Na/Mg Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24709-24715, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
PTCDA is for the first time implemented as an anode active material for aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries, with a novel &#8220;hybrid&#8221; aqueous electrolyte based on inexpensive non&#8208;fluorinated salts. The hybrid electrolyte supresses material dissolution during cycling and enables all&#8208;organic electrodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies.







Abstract
Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) are aspiring candidates for low environmental impact energy storage, especially when using organic electrodes. In this respect, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all&#8208;organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence &#8220;hybrid&#8221;, inexpensive and non&#8208;fluorinated Na/Mg&#8208;salts, it displays favourable physico&#8208;chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window &gt;3&#8197;V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long&#8208;term sustainability, and improved safety.

         <title>Photoinduced Trifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes Catalyzed by High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes</title>

Nickel complexes with simple naphthyridine ligands undergo facile aerobic oxidation to stable, isolated NiIII organometallic complexes, in which Ni&#8211;CF3 bond homolysis is observed upon irradiation with blue LED light. These complexes catalyze photoinduced C&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation in arenes and heteroarenes.







Abstract
We describe a series of air&#8208;stable NiIII complexes supported by a simple, robust naphthyridine&#8208;based ligand. Access to the high&#8208;valent oxidation state is enabled by the CF3 ligands on the nickel, while the naphthyridine exhibits either a monodentate or bidentate coordination mode that depends on the oxidation state and sterics, and enables facile aerobic oxidation of NiII to NiIII. These NiIII complexes act as efficient catalysts for photoinduced C(sp2)&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation reactions of (hetero)arenes using versatile synthetic protocols. This blue LED light&#8208;mediated catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical pathway and demonstrates potential in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogs.

         <title>Photocatalytic Arylation of P4 and PH3: Reaction Development Through Mechanistic Insight</title>

31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic studies provide significant, new insights into the mechanism of the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Through the first&#8208;time observation of a series of reaction intermediates, these studies have also inspired the development of the first examples of direct, catalytic arylation of PH3, which is a key synthetic intermediate for industrial phosphorus chemistry.







Abstract
Detailed 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic investigations provide deeper insight into the complex, multi&#8208;step mechanisms involved in the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Specifically, these studies have identified a number of previously unrecognized side products, which arise from an unexpected non&#8208;innocent behavior of the commonly employed terminal reductant Et3N. The different rate of formation of these products explains discrepancies in the performance of the two most effective catalysts, [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2][PF6] (dtbbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) and 3DPAFIPN. Inspired by the observation of PH3 as a minor intermediate, we have developed the first catalytic procedure for the arylation of this key industrial compound. Similar to P4 arylation, this method affords valuable triarylphosphines or tetraarylphosphonium salts depending on the steric profile of the aryl substituents.

         <title>Evolution of Molecularly Imprinted Enzyme Inhibitors: From Simple Activity Inhibition to Pathological Cell Regulation</title>

Molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) were tailored for the inhibition of trypsin&#8208;induced cell injury and angiogenin&#8208;induced cancer cell proliferation, demonstrating their great potentials as therapeutic drugs for disease treatment.







Abstract
Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid&#8208;phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs that exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion&#8208;induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin&#8208;dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing the angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells. Our work demonstrates the versatility of MIEIs for both enzyme inhibition and cell fate manipulation, showing their great potential as therapeutic drugs in biomedicine.

Like a music box , in nanopore single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprinting a rotating metal cylinder (an analyte) uses perfectly placed pins (the chemical groups of an analyte) that come up under the comb (the characteristic residue inside the nanopore inner wall) to strike the appropriate prongs or tines of that comb (confined interactions). In this way, each analyte generates a characteristic fingerprint frequency as it undergoes the confined interactions with the nanopore, as explained by Yi&#8208;Lun Ying, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;24582.

Structures of sodium hypochlorite and hypobromite hydrates provide the first direct insight into the geometry and hydrogen bonding properties of hypohalites, anions of great importance in general and inorganic chemistry. The crystal structure of sodium hypochlorite, the active component of bleach, fills a long&#8208;standing gap in structural chemistry, dating back to the discovery of chlorine bleaching by Berthollet, and the first development of liquid bleach in Javel, 18th&#160;century France. Details of this research are reported by Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263; et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;24400.

Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) multicolor heterostructures have shown great potential for achieving anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. In their Research Article on page&#8197;24519, Zhenhua Gao, Xiangeng Meng, Yong&#8197;Sheng Zhao et&#8197;al. have developed a strategy to construct 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures. The domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors in these 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs epitaxial heterostructures allow for definition of 2D photonic barcodes, which could be used for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Applying Machine Learning to Rechargeable Batteries: From the Microscale to the Macroscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24354-24366, November 8, 2021. </description>

This Minireview focuses on applying machine learning methods to lithium batteries&#8212;from the microscale to the macroscale&#8212;in combination with multiscale simulations, characterization techniques, and electrochemical tests. Machine learning enables the development of advanced theoretical and experimental tools, the mining of valuable information from datasets, and acceleration of strategy optimization for the design and management of battery materials.







Abstract
Emerging machine learning (ML) methods are widely applied in chemistry and materials science studies and have led to a focus on data&#8208;driven research. This Minireview summarizes the application of ML to rechargeable batteries, from the microscale to the macroscale. Specifically, ML offers a strategy to explore new functionals for density functional theory calculations and new potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, which are expected to significantly enhance the challenging descriptions of interfaces and amorphous structures. ML also possesses a great potential to mine and unveil valuable information from both experimental and theoretical datasets. A quantitative &#8220;structure&#8211;function&#8221; correlation can thus be established, which can be used to predict the ionic conductivity of solids as well as the battery lifespan. ML also exhibits great advantages in strategy optimization, such as fast&#8208;charge procedures. The future combination of multiscale simulations, experiments, and ML is also discussed and the role of humans in data&#8208;driven research is highlighted.

         <title>Droplet Microfluidics and Directed Evolution of Enzymes: An Intertwined Journey</title>

From bulk emulsification to on&#8208;chip droplet formation and sorting, droplet microfluidics offers numerous tools for high&#8208;throughput screening. Directed evolution has greatly benefitted from these technological advances over the last twenty years. This review article gives a chronological overview of in vivo directed evolution of enzymes facilitated by droplet microfluidics.







Abstract
Evolution is essential to the generation of complexity and ultimately life. It relies on the propagation of the properties, traits, and characteristics that allow an organism to survive in a challenging environment. It is evolution that shaped our world over about four billion years by slow and iterative adaptation. While natural evolution based on selection is slow and gradual, directed evolution allows the fast and streamlined optimization of a phenotype under selective conditions. The potential of directed evolution for the discovery and optimization of enzymes is mostly limited by the throughput of the tools and methods available for screening. Over the past twenty years, versatile tools based on droplet microfluidics have been developed to address the need for higher throughput. In this Review, we provide a chronological overview of the intertwined development of microfluidics droplet&#8208;based compartmentalization methods and in vivo directed evolution of enzymes.

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group via nondissociative chain walking and &#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group to provide arylation products having an alkene moiety at the remote position. The use of &#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination as a key step in the catalytic cycle allowed for regioselective formation of unstabilized alkenes after chain walking. This reaction was applicable to various arylboronic acids as well as alkene substrates.

         <title>Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;Catalyzed Carbenium Ion Generation and Autocatalytic Pyrazole Synthesis&#8212;A Computational and Experimental Study</title>

Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions between vinyl diazoacetates and aryl esters afforded highly regioselective N&#8208;alkylated pyrazoles. These reactions involve an autocatalytic process in which in situ formed carbenium species act as a catalyst to regioselectively afford pyrazoles. Detailed DFT studies were carried out to explain the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In recent years, metal&#8208;free organic synthesis using triarylboranes as catalysts has become a prevalent research area. Herein we report a comprehensive computational and experimental study for the highly selective synthesis of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the generation of carbenium species from the reaction between aryl esters and vinyl diazoacetates in the presence of catalytic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. DFT studies were undertaken to illuminate the reaction mechanism revealing that the in situ generation of a carbenium species acts as an autocatalyst to prompt the regiospecific formation of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles in good to excellent yields (up to 81&#8201;%).

The dimethyl bismuth cation, [BiMe2(SbF6)], has been isolated and characterized. Reaction with BiMe3 allows access to the first compound featuring Bi&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor bonding. In solution, dynamic behavior with methyl exchange via an unusual SE2 mechanism is observed, underlining the unique properties of bismuth species as soft Lewis acids with the ability to undergo reversible Bi&#8722;C bond cleavage.







Abstract
The isolation of simple, fundamentally important, and highly reactive organometallic compounds remains among the most challenging tasks in synthetic chemistry. The detailed characterization of such compounds is key to the discovery of novel bonding scenarios and reactivity. The dimethylbismuth cation, [BiMe2(SbF6)] (1), has been isolated and characterized. Its reaction with BiMe3 gives access to an unprecedented dative bond, a Bi&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. The exchange of methyl groups (arguably the simplest hydrocarbon moiety) between different metal atoms is among the most principal types of reactions in organometallic chemistry. The reaction of 1 with BiMe3 enables an SE2(back)&#8208;type methyl exchange, which is, for the first time, investigated in detail for isolable, (pseudo&#8208;)homoleptic main&#8208;group compounds.

         <title>Location&#8208;Dependent Lanthanide Selectivity Engineered into Structurally Characterized Designed Coiled Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24473-24477, November 8, 2021. </description>

Location&#8208;dependent size selectivity can be programmed into designed metallo coiled coils, allowing for the generation of near&#8208;identical selective and promiscuous metal&#8208;ion sites. The first crystal structure of a lanthanide bound within a coiled coil reveals that the existence of an optimal radius stems from the structural constraints of the peptide scaffold. Therefore, a selective site can in principle be designed de novo for any given Ln3+ ion.







Abstract
Herein we report unprecedented location&#8208;dependent, size&#8208;selective binding to designed lanthanide (Ln3+) sites within miniature protein coiled coil scaffolds. Not only do these engineered sites display unusual Ln3+ selectivity for moderately large Ln3+ ions (Nd to Tb), for the first time we demonstrate that selectivity can be location&#8208;dependent and can be programmed into the sequence. A 1&#8197;nm linear translation of the binding site towards the N&#8208;terminus can convert a selective site into a highly promiscuous one. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure, the first of a lanthanide binding site within a coiled coil to be reported, coupled with CD studies, reveal the existence of an optimal radius that likely stems from the structural constraints of the coiled coil scaffold. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of location&#8208;dependent metal selectivity within a coiled coil scaffold, as well as the first report of location&#8208;dependent Ln3+ selectivity within a protein.

         <title>Enantioselective Gel Phase Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Materials</title>

Asymmetric synthesis of MOMs in gels: Gel phase synthesis of metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) resulted in homochiral MOMs, which were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The chirality of the gelator dictated the handedness of the MOMs and the enantioselectivity was confirmed by solid&#8208;state circular dichroism experiments.







Abstract
We report the asymmetric synthesis of homochiral metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) in chiral gels from achiral components. The enantioselectivity of MOMs depends on the chirality of the gel, whereas the synthesis performed in solution phase and achiral gels resulted in conglomerates.

We report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs2NaxAg1&#8722;xInCl6:y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na+ and Mn2+, the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (ca. 100&#8201;%) and a long duration time (&gt;5400&#8197;s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals.

The energy transfer (ET) process between self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) and activators was investigated through time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, which suggested an ET efficiency up to 41&#8201;%. Importantly, the nominal concentration of dopants, especially in the case of Na+, was found a useful tool to control both energy level and number distribution of traps. Cryogenic afterglow measurements suggested that the afterglow phenomenon was likely governed by thermal&#8208;activated exciton diffusion and electron tunneling process.

Here we established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the introduction of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems into one side of the hour&#8208;glass shaped nanochannels. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels.







Abstract
Inspired by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), herein we have established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the ingenious introduction of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system into one side of artificial hour&#8208;glass shaped nanochannel. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels. In view of these promising results, the use of artificial nanochannel to improve protein transport not only presents a new potential chemical model for biological research and better understanding of protein transport behavior in the living systems, but also provides a high&#8208;flux protein transporter device, which may have applications in the design of protein drug release systems, protein separation systems and microfluidics in the near future.

The first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. Utilization of Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction, oxidative cyclization and intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, resulted in the completion of the total synthesis with 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of synthesized intermediate and cochlearol&#8197;B clearly confirmed the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B, a meroterpenoid natural product featuring a 4/5/6/6/6&#8208;fused pentacyclic structure. Key steps, oxidative cyclization and subsequent intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, which constructed the pentacyclic structure in highly stereoselective manner, allowed efficient access to cochlearol&#8197;B with the longest linear sequence of 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis clearly confirmed the stereochemistry of cochlearol&#8197;B.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Atom Transfer from Phosphaethynolate to an Alkylidyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24411-24417, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of sodium phosphaethynolate, Na(OCP), with vanadium alkylidynes is reported. Metathesis of V&#8801;C and P&#8801;C multiple bonds occurs, followed by carbonyl migration to the metal, overall resulting in a direct P&#8208;atom transfer from Na(OCP) to an alkylidyne ligand to yield vanadium&#8208;bound phosphaalkyne complexes.







Abstract
A low&#8208;spin and mononuclear vanadium complex, (Menacnac)V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu) (2) (Menacnac&#8722;=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), was prepared upon treatment of the vanadium neopentylidyne complex (Menacnac)V&#8801;CtBu(OTf) (1) with Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 (diox=1,4&#8208;dioxane), while the isoelectronic ate&#8208;complex [Na(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)]{([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu)} (4), was obtained via the reaction of Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 and ([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V&#8801;CtBu(OEt2) (3) in the presence of crown&#8208;ether. Computational studies suggest that the P&#8208;atom transfer proceeds by [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of the P&#8801;C bond across the V&#8801;CtBu moiety, followed by a reductive decarbonylation to form the V&#8722;C&#8801;O linkage. The nature of the electronic ground state in diamagnetic complexes, 2 and 4, was further investigated both theoretically and experimentally, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, and comparison of salient bond metrics derived from X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural characterization. In combination, these data are consistent with a low&#8208;valent vanadium ion in complexes 2 and 4. This study represents the first example of a metathesis reaction between the P&#8208;atom of [PCO]&#8722; and an alkylidyne ligand.

We fill a gap in fundamental and applied chemistry by providing the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structure characterization of hypohalite ions, including sodium hypochlorite: the active component of liquid bleach, in use as a bleaching agent and sanitizer for at least two centuries.







Abstract
We report the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structures of hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;) and hypobromite (BrO&#8722;) salts, including hydrated sodium hypochlorite, a staple of the chlorine industry and ubiquitous bleaching and disinfection agent for almost 200&#8197;years. The structures, supported by variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy on individual crystals and periodic density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide insight into solid&#8208;state geometry and supramolecular chemistry of hypohalite ions.

         <dc:description>
Laser ablation of solid organic compounds with high melting points is proposed for the in situ generation of new chemical species. Diaminomaleonitrile is used as a prototypical precursor, generating numerous interstellar compounds and aminocyanoacetylene for the first time. This experimental method could open the doors towards the discoveries of unsuspected molecules in space.







Abstract
The large amount of unstable species in the realm of interstellar chemistry drives an urgent need to develop efficient methods for the in situ generations of molecules that enable their spectroscopic characterizations. Such laboratory experiments are fundamental to decode the molecular universe by matching the interstellar and terrestrial spectra. We propose an approach based on laser ablation of nonvolatile solid organic precursors. The generated chemical species are cooled in a supersonic expansion and probed by high&#8208;resolution microwave spectroscopy. We present a proof of concept through a simultaneous formation of interstellar compounds and the first generation of aminocyanoacetylene using diaminomaleonitrile as a prototypical precursor. With this micro&#8208;laboratory, we open the door to generation of unsuspected species using precursors not typically accessible to traditional techniques such as electric discharge and pyrolysis.

         <title>Design of Persistent and Stable Porous Radical Polymers by Electronic Isolation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24424-24429, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an electronic isolation strategy to produce persistent and stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling of a meta&#8208;substituted monomer. The polymer exhibited chemical robustness, localized radical feature, high spin density, and broad yet strong absorption. The radical polymer applied in photothermal conversion yielded unprecedented performance of record&#8208;high temperature of 268&#8201;&#176;C and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Conjugated organic radical polymers with stable radical features are difficult to design because the &#960; conjugation in the polymer backbones makes the radicals readily delocalize and tend to undergo covalent bonding processes. In this work, we report an electronic isolation strategy to design stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling reaction from a meta&#8208;position active monomer. The meta linkage ensures less conjugation in the polymer skeletons, localizes the resonant radicals, and prevents them from recombination. The resulting porous radical polymer exhibits exceptional radical characters with ultralow band gap of 0.68&#8197;eV, strong yet extended UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption up to 1800&#8197;nm, and high spin density. The above features make the polymer very promising in the photothermal conversion with record&#8208;high photothermal temperature increment of &#8776;&#8764;240&#8201;&#176;C and striking solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%.

     alt="Design of Persistent and Stable Porous Radical Polymers by Electronic Isolation Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an electronic isolation strategy to produce persistent and stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling of a meta-substituted monomer. The polymer exhibited chemical robustness, localized radical feature, high spin density, and broad yet strong absorption. The radical polymer applied in photothermal conversion yielded unprecedented performance of record-high temperature of 268&#8201;&#176;C and solar-driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated organic radical polymers with stable radical features are difficult to design because the &#960; conjugation in the polymer backbones makes the radicals readily delocalize and tend to undergo covalent bonding processes. In this work, we report an electronic isolation strategy to design stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling reaction from a meta-position active monomer. The meta linkage ensures less conjugation in the polymer skeletons, localizes the resonant radicals, and prevents them from recombination. The resulting porous radical polymer exhibits exceptional radical characters with ultralow band gap of 0.68&#8197;eV, strong yet extended UV/Vis-NIR absorption up to 1800&#8197;nm, and high spin density. The above features make the polymer very promising in the photothermal conversion with record-high photothermal temperature increment of &#8776;&#8764;240&#8201;&#176;C and striking solar-driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of electronic isolation of radicals for producing outstanding photothermal materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Chuangxinmycin Featuring a Deubiquitinase&#8208;like Sulfurtransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24418-24423, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biochemical basis of the sulfur&#8208;incorporation reaction during chuangxinmycin biosynthesis is elucidated. Particularly, the deubiquitinase&#8208;like Cxm3 stands for the first JAMM/MPN+ family protein catalyzing a sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction, instead of the typical amido&#8208;bond hydrolysis reaction, by interacting with a ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG.







Abstract
The knowledge on sulfur incorporation mechanism involved in sulfur&#8208;containing molecule biosynthesis remains limited. Chuangxinmycin is a sulfur&#8208;containing antibiotic with a unique thiopyrano[4,3,2&#8208;cd]indole (TPI) skeleton and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase. Despite the previously reported biosynthetic gene clusters and the recent functional characterization of a P450 enzyme responsible for C&#8722;S bond formation, the enzymatic mechanism for sulfur incorporation remains unknown. Here, we resolve this central biosynthetic problem by in vitro biochemical characterization of the key enzymes and reconstitute the TPI skeleton in a one&#8208;pot enzymatic reaction. We reveal that the JAMM/MPN+ protein Cxm3 functions as a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase to catalyze a non&#8208;classical sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction by interacting with the ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG. This finding adds a new mechanism for sulfurtransferase in nature.

         <title>Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant 2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;Aminochroman Derivatives via Enzymatic Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24456-24460, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalytic synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives was achieved with imine reductases (IREDs) at preparative scale, showing enantiocomplementary selectivity for most of the products and yields as high as 91&#8201;%. Precursors of Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT were successfully synthesised, as well as the Parkinson's disease agent Rotigotine in a 3&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives are key structural motifs present in a wide range of pharmaceutically important molecules. Herein, we report an effective biocatalytic approach towards these molecules through the enantioselective reductive coupling of 2&#8208;tetralones and 3&#8208;chromanones with a diverse range of primary amine partners. Metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs) were employed as the biocatalysts, obtaining high yields and enantiocomplementary selectivity for &gt;15 examples at preparative scale, including the precursors to Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT. We also present a convergent chemo&#8208;enzymatic total synthesis of the Parkinson's disease therapy Rotigotine in 63&#8201;% overall yield and 92&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Controlling the Multiple Chiroptical Inversion in Biphasic Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24430-24436, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiple chiroptical inversion in Azo biphasic liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) polymers is for the first time realized in&#8197;situ through the tail length modification and degree of polymerization (DP) variation. The amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of three stacking modes, thereby controlling the dynamic reversal of supramolecular chirality.







Abstract
While controlling the chirality and modulating the helicity is a challenging task, it attracts great research interest for gaining a better understanding of the origin of chirality in nature. Herein, structurally similar azobenzene (Azo) vinyl monomers were designed in which the alkyl chains comprised the chiral stereocenter with different achiral tail lengths. Combining the synchronous polymerization, supramolecular stacking and self&#8208;assembly, the multiple chiroptical inversion of the Azo&#8208;polymer supramolecular assemblies can be modulated by the tail length and DP of Azo blocks during in&#8197;situ polymerization. The DP&#8208;, UV light&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, aging time&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties and liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) characterization indicated that the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of intra&#8208;chain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, inter&#8208;chain H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregation, thereby controlling the dynamic multiple reversal of supramolecular chirality.

The 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework Cu&#8208;HHTQ with multiple redox&#8208;active sites originating from a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and a CuO4 unit was designed for Li&#8208;ion batteries with high capacity, extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. TQ was identified as redox&#8208;active with Li+ for the first time.







Abstract
Heteroaromatic&#8208;conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li&#8208;ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes. Herein, we immobilize a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and CuO4 unit into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to unlock their potential for Li+ storage. TQ was identified redox activity with Li+ for the first time. With a synergistic effect of TQ and CuO4 unit, the 2D conductive MOF, named Cu&#8208;HHTQ (HHTQ=2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), can facilitate the Li+/e&#8722; transport and ensure a resilient electrode, resulting in a high capacity of 657.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. Our findings highlight an efficient strategy of constructing electrode materials for energy storage with combining multiple redox&#8208;active moieties into conductive MOFs.

         <title>Organic Long Persistent Luminescence Through In Situ Generation of Cuprous(I) Ion Pairs in Ionic Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24437-24442, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) system based on in situ generated ionic pairs with CuI centers is proposed and demonstrated. Intermediates are proposed and verified through a series of carefully designed experiments. The afterglow of corresponding blends can last more than 3&#8197;hours, thus this mechanism is the first to incorporate CuI ions in OLPL systems.







Abstract
Recent development of most organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems employed binary or tertiary doping. However, the design strategies towards OLPL materials with hour&#8208;long afterglow duration are still quite limited. Here, we propose a novel OLPL system through melt&#8208;casting method with 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of CuI complexes: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl BINAP&#8208;CuX (X=Cl, Br and I) doped into the triphenylphosphine (TPP) host. The charge separation was initiated prior to excitation through host coordination with CuI complexes, resulting in semi&#8208;free halogen ions and in situ generated CuI cations, which forms TPP + BINAP&#8208;CuX ionic pairs and subsequently ionic solids. The OLPL lifetime can be readily modulated by different halogen atoms and the afterglow can last up to more than 3&#8197;hours perceivable to human eyes. This is a rare example of OLPL initiated through host&#8208;guest coordination that could potentially expand the definition of OLPL systems and design strategies.

         <title>The Archetypal Homoleptic Lanthanide Quadruple&#8208;Decker&#8212;Synthesis, Mechanistic Studies, and Quantum Chemical Investigations</title>

The synthesis of the first well&#8208;defined neutral and homoleptic (same metal, same ligand) all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based quadruple&#8208;decker complexes [SmIII/II/III3(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) along with other unique sandwich complexes is shown.







Abstract
Reduction of [SmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)(BH4)(thf)] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) with KC8 resulted in [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4], the first example of a homoleptic lanthanide quadruple&#8208;decker. As indicated by an analysis of the bond metrics in the solid&#8208;state, the inner Sm ion is present in the divalent oxidation state, while the outer ones are trivalent. This observation could be confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Mechanistic studies revealed not only insight into possible formation pathways of [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] but also resulted in the transformation to other mixed metal sandwich complexes with unique structural properties. These are the 1D&#8208;polymeric chain structured [KSmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)]n and the hexametallic species [(tol)K(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)SmII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)K]2 which were initially envisioned as possible building blocks as part of different retrosynthetically guided pathways that we developed.

         <title>Vertical Graphene Arrays as Electrodes for Ultra&#8208;High Energy Density AC Line&#8208;Filtering Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 46, Page 24505-24509, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field assisted PECVD method was developed to grow strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) as electrode materials of ECs. The EC&#8208;SVGAs with aqueous or organic electrolyte exhibit excellent CA of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2, &#934; of 80.6&#176;, and energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 120&#8197;Hz with arbitrary AC filtering performances, which is far better than most carbon&#8208;related devices, demonstrating the potential for replacement of conventional AECs.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC), as an ideal lightweight filtering capacitor, can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). However, current electrodes are stuck in limited electrode area and tortuous ion transport. Herein, strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) prepared by electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition have been successfully designed as the main electrode to ensure ions rapidly adsorb/desorb in richly available graphene surface. SVGAs exhibit an outstanding specific areal capacitance of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#934;120=80.6&#176; even after 500&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, which is far better than that of most carbon&#8208;related materials. Impressively, the output voltage could also be improved to 2.5&#8197;V when using organic electrolyte. An ultra&#8208;high energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can also be handily achieved. Moreover, ECs&#8208;SVGAs can well smooth arbitrary AC waveforms into DC signals, exhibiting excellent filtering performance.

A MnI&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and the 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane is described. In the case of alkenes anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place, while in the case of alkynes the reaction proceeds with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
A MnI&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and a 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane (HBPin) is described. For alkenes, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place; for alkynes the reaction proceeds with excellent trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity. The most active pre&#8208;catalyst is bench&#8208;stable alkyl bisphosphine MnI complex fac&#8208;[Mn(dippe)(CO)3(CH2CH2CH3)]. The catalytic process is initiated by migratory insertion of a CO ligand into the Mn&#8211;alkyl bond to yield an acyl intermediate, which undergoes B&#8722;H bond cleavage of HBPin (for alkenes) and rapid C&#8722;H bond cleavage (for alkynes), forming the active MnI boryl and acetylide catalysts [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(BPin)] and [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(C&#8801;CR)], respectively. A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes was efficiently and selectively borylated. Mechanistic insights are provided based on experimental data and DFT calculations revealing that an acceptorless reaction is operating involving dihydrogen release.

         <dc:description>
Two nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographenes bearing an azepine ring and an azocine ring, respectively, were synthesized and saddle&#8208;shaped and saddle&#8208;helix structures were obtained. Notably, two synthetic routes were adopted for the synthesis, the azepine&#8208;embedded polyaromatic was prepared by using cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide instead of typical alkyne and tetraphenylcyclopenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;one.







Abstract
Two novel nitrogen&#8208;doped, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based nanographenes (NGs) 1 and 2 bearing an azepine and an azocine at the fjord region, respectively, were synthesized and characterized. Notably, structure 1 was synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide, followed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and Scholl&#8208;type reactions, which represents a modified strategy to construct NGs. The azo&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded NG 1 leads to a saddle shape, and the azo&#8208;octagon&#8208;embedded NG 2 exhibits a distorted saddle&#8208;helix conformation with the largest torsion angle recorded so far in [5]helicenes. As a result, the different structural topographies for NGs 1 and 2 lead to significant changes in the optical properties including UV absorption and fluorescent emission. Additionally, the 8&#960;&#8208;heterocycles azepine and azocine in the NGs 1 and 2 exhibited obvious antiaromatic properties.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Polymer Cyclization via Supramolecular Confinement of Cyanostilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient synthesis of cyclic polymers has received much attention in polymer chemistry field. Although photochemical cycloaddition of terminal &#960;&#8208;bonded units provides a plausible way toward cyclic polymerization, it remains challenging to avoid side reactions by manipulating photochemical selectivity. Herein supramolecular confinement has been developed as a promising strategy to address this issue, by introducing highly directional hydrogen bonds to the photo&#8208;reactive cyanostilbenes. The cyanostilbenes units on both ends of a telechelic macromonomer are orientationally aligned with high local concentrations, yielding [2 + 2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition products upon 430 nm light irradiation. It leads to the formation of cyclic polymers in the self&#8208;assembled state, in stark contrast to Z&#8211;E isomerization of cyanostilbenes in the monomeric state. Overall, supramolecular confinement effect exemplified in the current study provides new avenues toward cyclic topological polymers with high synthetic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: shedding light on nano&#8208;bio interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8208;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for nano&#8208;bio interaction studies and allows for scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of the recent progress of FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8208;bio interfacing. By investigating various FNAs, we summarize their biological profiles and immune responses as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts of applying FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this mini&#8208;review can bring up&#8208;to&#8208;date information on FNA and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) enhance the repertoire of protein function and mediate or influence the activity of the majority of cellular processes. The preparation of site&#8208;specifically and homogeneously modified proteins to apply as tools to understand the biological role of PTMs is a challenging task. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated desulfurative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond forming reaction that enables the site&#8208;selective installation of N&#949;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins of interest.

         <dc:description>Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) are auspicious targets in drug discovery to combat antimicrobial resistance; however, its non&#8208;carbohydrate drug&#8208;like inhibitors are still spacious. Here, we present a druggable pocket in a &#946;&#8208;propeller lectin BambL from&#160;  Burkholderia ambifaria&#160;  as a potential target for allosteric inhibitors. This site was identified employing&#160;  19  F NMR fragment screening and a computational pocket prediction algorithm SiteMap. The structure&#8208;activity relationship study revealed the most promising fragment with a dissociation constant of 0.3&#177;0.1 mM and a ligand efficiency of 0.3 kcal mol  &#8208;1  HA  &#8208;1  &#160;that affected the orthosteric site. This effect was substantiated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in the orthosteric and secondary pockets. Future drug&#8208;discovery campaigns that aim to develop small molecule inhibitors can benefit from allosteric sites in lectins as a new therapeutic approach against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;mediated Conversion of Dinitrogen and Nitric Oxide to Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive splitting of N2&#160;is an attractive strategy towards nitrogen fixation beyond ammonia at ambient conditions. However, the resulting nitride complexes often suffer from thermodynamic overstabilization hampering functionalization. Furthermore, oxidative nitrogen atom transfer of N2&#160;derived nitrides remains unknown. We here report a ReIV&#160;pincer platform that mediates N2&#160;splitting upon chemical reduction or electrolysis with unprecedented yield.&#160;The N2&#160;derived ReVnitrides undergo facile nitrogen atom transfer to nitric oxide, giving nitrous oxide nearly quantitatively. Experimental and computational results indicate that outer&#8208;sphere ReN/NO radical coupling is facilitated by the activation of the nitride&#160;via&#160;initial coordination of NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Hydrophobicity for Ultrafast Oil&#8208;Water Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great potentials for addressing the challenge of highly efficient oil&#8208;water separation, but they are restricted by the poor wettability and processability as crystalline membranes. Here we report the design and synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability, allowing the COF layers to be directly grown on the support surfaces. Three 2D COFs with AA or ABC stacking are prepared by condensation of triamines with fluorine and/or isopropyl groups and perfluorodialdehyde. They all show excellent tolerance to water, acid, and base, with water contact angles (CA) of 111.5&#176;&#8208;145.8&#176;. The two COFs with isopropyl and fluorine mixtures can grow as a coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, whereas the one with only fluorine substituents cannot. The superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating with water CA of up to 150.1&#176; displays high water&#8208;resistance and self&#8208;cleaning properties, enabling high oil&#8208;water separation performances, with the efficiency of over 99.5% and permeation flux of 2.84 &#215; 10  5  L m  &#8722;2  h  &#8722;1  , which are among the highest values reported for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo3S132&#8208;  Intercalated Layered Double Hydroxide: Highly Selective Removal of Heavy Metals  and Simultaneous Reduction of Ag+  Ions to  Metallic Ag0  Ribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a new material by intercalating Mo3S132&#8208;&#160;into&#160;Mg/Al layered double hydroxides (abbr. Mo3S13&#8208;LDH), exhibiting excellent capture capability for&#160;toxic Hg2+&#160;and noble metal silver (Ag).&#160;The as&#8208;prepared Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;displays ultra&#8208;high selectivity&#160;of Ag+, Hg2+  and Cu2+&#160;in the presence of various competitive ions,&#160;with a&#160;order of&#160;Ag+&gt;Hg2+&gt;Cu2+&gt;Pb2+&#8805;Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+. For Ag+&#160;and Hg2+, extremely fast adsorption rates (~90% within 10&#160;min, &gt;99% in 1 h) are observed. Much high selectivity is present for Ag+  and Cu2+, especially for trace amounts of Ag+(~1 ppm), achieving a large seperation factor (SFAg/Cu) of ~8000 at the large Cu/Ag&#160;ratio&#160;of 520. The overwhelming adsorption capacities for Ag+(qmAg=1073 mg/g) and Hg2+(qmHg=594&#160;mg/g) place the Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;at the top of performing sorbent materials.&#160;Most importantly, Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;captures Ag+&#160;via  &#160;two paths: a)&#160;formation of Ag2S&#160;due to Ag&#8208;S complexation and precipitation,&#160;and&#160;b)&#160;reduction of Ag+  to&#160;metallic silver (Ag0).&#160;The Mo3S13&#8208;LDH&#160;is a promising material to extract low&#8208;grade silver from copper&#8208;rich&#160;minerals&#160;and trap highly toxic Hg2+&#160;from polluted water.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Processable COF Gel Electrolyte Enabled by Side Chain Engineering for Lithium&#8208;ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with graphene&#8208;like structure present unique chemical and physical properties, they are essentially insoluble and infusible crystalline powders with poor processability, hindering their further practical applications. How to improve the processability of COF materials is a major challenge in this field. In this contribution, we proposed a general side chain engineering strategy to construct gel&#8208;state COF with high processability. This method takes advantages of large and soft branched alkyl side chains as internal plasticizers to achieve the gelation of COF, and systematically studied the influence of the length of the side chain on the COF gel formation. Benefit from their machinability and flexibility, this novel COF gel can be easily processed into gel&#8208;type electrolytes with specific sharpness and thickness, which were further applied to assemble the lithium ion batteries that exhibited high cycling stability.</dc:description>
