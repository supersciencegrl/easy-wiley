         <title>Salt Metathesis: Tetrafluoroborate Anion Rapidly Fluoridates Organoboronic Acids to give Organotrifluoroborates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrafluoroborate anion, considered to be weakly coordinating and relatively inert for organic chemistry applications, readily undergoes salt metasthesis with organoboronic acids to afford the corresponding organotrifluoroborates. Its spontaneous solvolysis in methanol to HF/MeOBF3&#8722; and pH&#8208;dependent aqueous solvolysis as a more general feature, highlight its non&#8208;inertness and reactivity potential for use in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) has long been used as a spectator counter anion. Herein, we report an unprecedented salt metathesis between a variety of BF4&#8722; salts and a series of organoboronic acids yielding the corresponding organotrifluoroborates. We identified conditions for fast and efficient fluoridation (&lt;1&#8197;h) with minimal workup. Fundamentally, this work discloses the proclivity of BF4&#8722; to exchange fluoride atoms with organoboronates, highlighting the lability of BF4&#8722;.

         <title>Probing a Hydrogen&#8208;&#960; Interaction Involving a Trapped Water Molecule in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR at fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100&#8197;kHz) and high static magnetic field (28.2&#8197;T) has been employed in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations to study a trapped water molecule in the cavity of a calix[4]arene lanthanide complex. The study illustrates the high sensitivity of proton NMR chemical&#8208;shift values for non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events.







Abstract
The detection and characterization of trapped water molecules in chemical entities and biomacromolecules remains a challenging task for solid materials. We herein present proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments at 100&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning and at high static magnetic&#8208;field strengths (28.2&#8197;T) enabling the detection of a single water molecule fixed in the calix[4]arene cavity of a lanthanide complex by a combination of three types of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The water proton resonances are detected at a chemical&#8208;shift value close to zero ppm, which we further confirm by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Density Functional Theory calculations pinpoint to the sensitivity of the proton chemical&#8208;shift value for hydrogen&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our study highlights how proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR is turning into the method&#8208;of&#8208;choice in probing weak non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events in chemistry and biology.

         <title>Solvent Induced Conversion of a Self&#8208;Assembled Gyrobifastigium to a Barrel and Encapsulation of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine within the Barrel for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare gyrobifastigium structure was constructed and converted to its isomeric Pd8 tetragonal barrel by simple treatment with water. The water&#8208;soluble barrel was used as a host to encapsulate hydrophobic photosensitizer zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc) for enhanced PDT activity in the aqueous medium under red light irradiation.







Abstract
A rare gyrobifastigium architecture (GB) was constructed by self&#8208;assembly of a tetradentate donor (L) with PdII acceptor in DMSO. The GB was converted to its isomeric tetragonal barrel (MB) upon treatment with water. The hydrophobic cavity of MB has been explored for the encapsulation of zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), which is an excellent photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the poor water&#8208;solubility and aggregation tendency are the main reasons for the suboptimal PDT performance of free ZnPc in the aqueous medium. Effective solubilization of ZnPc in an aqueous medium was achieved by encapsulating it in the cavity of MB. The inclusion complex (ZnPc&#8834;MB) showed enhanced singlet oxygen generation in water. Higher cellular uptake and anticancer activity of the ZnPc&#8834;MB compared to free ZnPc on HeLa cells indicate that encapsulation of ZnPc in an aqueous host is a potential strategy for enhancement of its PDT activity in water.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Clay C.&#8197;C. Wang. He and his collaborators recently published an article on the conversion of polyethylenes to fungal secondary metabolites. First, the team employs an oxidative catalytic process, highly tolerant of impurities, to degrade post&#8208;consumer polyethylenes to carboxylic diacids. Then, they utilize engineered strains of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans to convert these diacids to structurally diverse and pharmacologically active secondary metabolites. &#8220;Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites&#8221;, C.

         <title>Enantioselective Radical&#8208;Type 1,2&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;Phosphinoylation to Styrenes Catalyzed by Chiral Vanadyl Complexes</title>

         <title>Achieving High Single&#8208;Pass Carbon Conversion Efficiencies in Durable CO2 Electroreduction in Strong Acids via Electrode Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acidic CO2 reduction (CO2R) holds promise for the synthesis of low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint chemicals using renewable electricity. However, the corrosion of catalysts in strong acids causes severe hydrogen evolution and rapid deterioration of CO2R performance. Here, by coating catalysts with an electrically nonconductive nanoporous SiC&#8208;Nafion&#8482; layer, a near&#8208;neutral pH was stabilized on catalyst surfaces, thereby protecting the catalysts against corrosion for durable CO2R in strong acids. Electrode microstructures played a critical role in regulating ion diffusion and stabilizing electrohydrodynamic flows near catalyst surfaces. This surface&#8208;coating strategy was applied to three catalysts, SnBi, Ag, and Cu, and they exhibited high activity over extended CO2R operation in strong acids. Using a stratified SiC&#8208;Nafion&#8482;/SnBi/PTFE electrode, constant production of formic acid was achieved with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90% at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 over 125 h at pH 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Strategy to Drive the Intracellular Uptake of Lipid Nanoparticles for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles&#8217; uptake by cancer cells upon reaching the tumor microenvironment is often the rate&#8208;limiting step in cancer nanomedicine. Herein, we report that the inclusion of aminopolycarboxylic acid conjugated lipids, such as EDTA&#8208; or DTPAhexadecylamide lipids in liposome&#8208;like porphyrin nanoparticles (PS) enhanced their intracellular uptake by 25&#8208;fold, which was attributed to these lipids&#8217; ability to fluidize the cell membrane in a detergent&#8208;like manner rather than by metal chelation of EDTA or DTPA. EDTA&#8208;lipidincorporated&#8208;PS (ePS) take advantage of its unique active uptake mechanism to achieve &gt;95% photodynamic therapy (PDT) cell killing compared to &lt;5% cell killing by PS. In multiple tumor models, ePS demonstrated fast fluorescence&#8208;enabled tumor delineation within minutes post&#8208;injection and increased PDT potency (100% survival rate) compared to PS (60%). This study offers a new nanoparticle cellular uptake strategy to overcome challenges associated with conventional drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Host&#8208;Guest Charge Transfer of a Water&#8208;Soluble Double&#8208;Cavity Cyclophane for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) over NIR&#8208;II biowindow (1000&#8211;1350 nm) are highly desirable, but the rarity greatly limits their applications. Based on a water&#8208;soluble double&#8208;cavity cyclophane GBox&#8208;44+, we report a class of host&#8208;guest charge transfer (CT) complexes as structurally uniform PTAs for NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. Due to high electron&#8208;deficiency, GBox&#8208;44+ can bind different electron&#8208;rich planar guests in 1:2 host/guest stoichiometry to readily tune the CT absorption band extending to the NIR&#8208;II region. When using a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain, the host&#8208;guest system realized both good biocompatibility and enhanced 1064 nm photothermal conversion, and was then exploited as a high&#8208;efficiency NIR&#8208;II PTA for cancer cell and bacterial ablation. This work broadens the potential applications of host&#8208;guest cyclophane systems and provides a new access to bio&#8208;friendly NIR&#8208;II photoabsorbers with well&#8208;defined structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrically Switchable Persistent Spin Texture in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a momentum&#8208;independent spin configuration, &#160;persistent spin texture (PST) could avoid spin relaxation and play an advantageous role in spin lifetime. Nevertheless, manipulation of PST is a challenge due to the limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we present electrically switchable PST in a new 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (PA)2CsPb2Br7 (where PA is n&#8208;pentylammonium), which has a high Curie&#160;emperature of 349 K, evident spontaneous polarization (3.2 &#956;C cm&#8208;2)&#160;and a low coercive electric field of 5.3 kV cm&#8208;1.&#160;The combination of&#160;symmetry&#8208;breaking in ferroelectrics and effective spin&#8208;orbit field facilitates intrinsic PSTin the bulk and monolayer structure models. Strikingly, the directions of spin texture are reversible by switching the spontaneous electric polarization. This electric switching behavior relates to the tilting of PbBr6 octahedra and the reorientation of organic PA+ cations. Our studies on ferroelectric PST of 2D hybrid perovskites afford a platform for electrical spin texture manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydride&#8208;containing 2&#8208;Electron Pd/Cu Superatoms as Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first hydride&#8208;containing 2&#8208;electron palladium/copper alloys, [PdHCu11{S2P(O i Pr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)4] (PdHCu11) and [PdHCu12{S2P(O i Pr)2}5{S2PO(O i Pr)} (C&#8801;CPh)4] (PdHCu12), are synthesized from the reaction of [PdH2Cu14{S2P(O i Pr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)6] (PdH2Cu14) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the PdHCu11 and PdHCu12 kernels consist of a central PdH unit encapsulated within a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron and complete Cu12 cuboctahedron, respectively. DFT calculations indicate that both PdHCu11 and PdHCu12can be considered as axially&#8208;distorted 2&#8208;electron superatoms. PdHCu11 shows excellent HER activity, unprecedented within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8211;0.05 V (at 10 mA cm&#8211;2), a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec&#8211;1, and consistent HER activity during 1000 cycles. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pd site is the key to HER activity and may provide guidelines for correlating catalyst structures and HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;Bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles has been established via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition of indole&#8208;based enaminones with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters. This study provides a new strategy for the highly selective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles and shows the successful application of such skeletons in medicinal and synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
This study establishes the first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+2) cycloadditions of indole&#8208;based enaminones as novel platform molecules with 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, where de novo indole&#8208;ring formation is involved. Using this new strategy, various axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles were synthesized in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 87&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee). More importantly, this class of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles exhibited some degree of cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and was derived into axially chiral phosphine ligands with high catalytic activity. This study provides a new strategy for enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisindoles using asymmetric organocatalysis and is the first to realize the applications of such scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) Endows Mo6S8 with Fast Interfacial Magnesium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) layer can be constructed on the surface of a Mo6S8 cathode through the oxidation of a boron&#8208;centered magnesium salt. This CEI layer is favorable for the desolvation of Mg2+, so that the chloride&#8208;free magnesium electrolyte can support the effective cycling of magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) metal secondary batteries have attracted much attention for their high safety and high energy density characteristics. However, the significant issues of the cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Mg batteries are still being ignored. In this work, a significant CEI layer on the typical Mo6S8 cathode surface has been unprecedentedly constructed through the oxidation of the chloride&#8208;free magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2) salt under a proper charge cut&#8208;off voltage condition. The CEI has been identified to contain BxOy effective species originating from the oxidation of [B(hfip)4]&#8722; anion. It is confirmed that the BxOy species is beneficial to the desolvation of solvated Mg2+, speeding up the interfacial Mg2+ transfer kinetics, thereby improving the Mg2+&#8208;storage capability of Mo6S8 host. The firstly reported CEI in Mg batteries will give deeper insights into the interface issues in multivalent electrochemical systems.

         <title>Enzyme Engineering for High&#8208;Yielding Amide Formation: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Glycines in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;acyl glycines are essential biosurfactants in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Their commercial production involves the use of neurotoxic phosgene. Aiming towards green synthesis of these amides, we developed a novel amide synthesis concept involving glycerol activation and evolved a hydrolytic enzyme by reshaping its catalytic pocket into a highly active amide bond&#8208;forming enzyme, displaying 400&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency for N&#8208;lauroylglycine synthesis with over 80&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Amide syntheses remain a key challenging green chemistry reaction. For instance, green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycines as biosurfactants and therapeutics is highly desirable to replace chemical pathways using toxic phosgene. Herein, we report a novel concept for enzymatic amidation in an aqueous system via glycerol activation of fatty acids and theirsubsequent aminolysis with glycine to synthesize N&#8208;acyl glycines. We then engineer an enzyme (proRML) by reshaping its catalytic pocket to enhance its aminolysis activity and catalytic efficiency by 103&#8208;fold and 465&#8208;fold, respectively. The evolved proRML (D156S/L258K/L267N/S83D/L58K/R86K/W88V) catalyzed the amidation of a fatty acid with glycine to give N&#8208;lauroylglycine with high yield (80&#8201;%). It accepts a broad range of medium&#8208; to long&#8208;chain fatty acids (C8&#8211;C18), giving high yields of N&#8208;decanoyl&#8208;, N&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;, and N&#8208;oleoylglycine. The developed amidation concept may be general, and the engineered enzyme is useful for the green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycines.

         <title>Thermally Activated Long Persistent Luminescence of Organic Inorganic Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional afterglow of organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) is mostly attributed to the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. A new type of OIMH is demonstrated with long persistent luminescence (LPL) caused by the charge separation state. The stable LPL process is thermally activated and can be excited by low power standard LED light sources, offering potential in fire safety, information encryption, biological imaging and other fields.







Abstract
Long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials of SrAl2O4 doped with Eu2+ or Dy3+ can maintain emission over hours after ceasing the excitation but suffer from insolubility, high cost, and harsh preparation. Recently, organic LPL of guest&#8208;host exciplex systems has been demonstrated via an intermediate charge&#8208;separated state with flexible design but poor air&#8208;stability. Here, we synthesized a nontoxic two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic metal hybrid halides (OIMHs), called PBA2[ZnX4] with X=Br or Cl and PBA=4&#8208;phenylbenzylamine. These materials exhibit stable LPL emission over minutes at room&#8208;temperature, which is two orders of magnitude longer than those of previously reported OIMHs. The mechanism study shows that the LPL emission comes from thermally activated charge separation state rather than room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Moreover, the LPL of PBA2[ZnX4] can be excited by low power sources, representing an effective strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;stability LPL systems.

Here, we synthesized a nontoxic two-dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic metal hybrid halides (OIMHs), called PBA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ZnX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] with X=Br or Cl and PBA=4-phenylbenzylamine. These materials exhibit stable LPL emission over minutes at room-temperature, which is two orders of magnitude longer than those of previously reported OIMHs. The mechanism study shows that the LPL emission comes from thermally activated charge separation state rather than room-temperature phosphorescence. Moreover, the LPL of PBA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ZnX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] can be excited by low power sources, representing an effective strategy for developing low-cost and high-stability LPL systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast One&#8208;Handed Helix Induction and Its Static Helicity Memory in a Poly(biphenylylacetylene) with a Catalytic Amount of Chiral Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and subsequent static helicity memory in a poly(biphenylylacetylene) were achieved using a catalytic amount of nonracemic ammonium salts comprised of non&#8208;coordinating tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate as a counter anion. It relies on crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like specific intermolecular complex formation of the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants with chiral ammonium in specific aromatic solvents.







Abstract
We report an ultra&#8208;fast helix induction and subsequent static helicity memory in poly(biphenylylacetylene) (PBPA&#8208;A) assisted by a catalytic amount of nonracemic ammonium salts comprised of non&#8208;coordinating tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (BArF&#8722;) as a counter anion. The remarkable acceleration of the helix&#8208;induction rate in PBPA&#8208;A accompanied by the significant amplification of the asymmetry relies on the two methoxymethoxy groups of the biphenyl pendants, which can gain access to enfold the chiral ammoniums in a crown&#8208;ether manner in specific aromatic solvents, leading to ultra&#8208;fast helicity induction, which is completed within 30&#8197;s. In aromatic solvents, helicity memory is lost rapidly, but is quite stable in long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. The best use of specific solvents for helicity induction and static helicity memory, respectively, provides a highly sensitive chirality sensing system toward a small amount of chiral amines and amino acids when complexed with BArF&#8722;.

         <title>Fabrication of Super&#8208;Sized Metal Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Glass with Supramolecular Network via Crystallization&#8208;Suppressing Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex glass with supramolecular network was synthesized by the crystallization&#8208;suppressing strategy. The prepared glass possesses interesting optical and structural properties such as high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic structure. The dyes&#8208;doped hybrid glass exhibits polarized light with a polarization ratio up to 47&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal coordination compound (MCC) glasses [e.g., metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass, coordination polymer glass, and metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex (MIOC) glass] are emerging members of the hybrid glass family. So far, a limited number of crystalline MCCs can be converted into glasses by melt&#8208;quenching. Here, we report a universal wet&#8208;chemistry method, by which the super&#8208;sized supramolecular MIOC glasses can be synthesized from non&#8208;meltable MOFs. Alcohol and acid were used as agents to inhibit crystallization. The MIOC glasses demonstrate unique features including high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic network. Directional photoluminescence with a large polarization ratio (&#8776;47&#8201;%) was observed from samples doped with organic dyes. This crystallization&#8208;suppressing approach enables fabrication of super&#8208;sized MCC glasses, which cannot be achieved by conventional vitrification methods, and thus allows for exploring new MCC glasses possessing photonic functionalities.

         <title>A Transformable and Bulky Methacrylate Monomer That Enables the Synthesis of an MMA&#8208;nBA Alternating Copolymer: Sequence&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulky and transformable methacrylate monomer was designed for the synthesis of a methyl methacrylate (MMA)&#8208;n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA) alternating copolymer. The keys to this achievement are the introduction of the adamantyl group to suppress homopolymerization of the MMA monomer and the transesterification for the selective and quantitative transformation into methyl ester pendants. The alternating copolymer exhibited superior self&#8208;healing properties compared to the statistical copolymer.







Abstract
In this study, we designed a methacrylate molecule with an alkyl&#8208;substituted trichloro salicylic acid pendant as a transformable bulky monomer to enable the synthesis of an alternating copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA). The adamantyl&#8208;substituted methacrylate monomer (1&#8208;Ad) showed very low homopolymerization propensity in radical polymerizations, but afforded the alternating copolymer with nBA via copolymerization. The 1&#8208;Ad units in the resultant copolymer were quantitatively and selectively transformed into MMA via transesterification with methanol to yield the alternating copolymer of MMA and nBA. Its alternating sequence was clearly demonstrated by a structural analysis via 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as the low reactivity ratios for the 1&#8208;Ad and nBA pair. Finally, we verified the superior self&#8208;healing ability of the alternating copolymer compared to that of the corresponding 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 statistical copolymer.

         <title>Complete Depolymerization of PET Wastes by an Evolved PET Hydrolase from Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iterative rounds of directed evolution of PETase was performed employing a novel high&#8208;throughput fluorescence screening assay with a newly designed substrate BHET&#8208;OH. The generated DepoPETase enabled complete depolymerization of untreated PET wastes at mild temperature. The identified substitutions stabilized the loops around the active sites and transmitted the stabilization effect to the active sites through enhancing inter&#8208;loop interactions network.







Abstract
PETase displays great potential in PET depolymerization. Directed evolution has been limited to engineer PETase due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput screening assay. In this study, a novel fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening assay employing a newly designed substrate, bis (2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalate (termed BHET&#8208;OH), was developed for PET hydrolases. The best variant DepoPETase produced 1407&#8208;fold more products towards amorphous PET film at 50&#8201;&#176;C and showed a 23.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm value than the PETase WT. DepoPETase enabled complete depolymerization of seven untreated PET wastes and 19.1&#8197;g PET waste (0.4&#8201;% Wenzyme/WPET) in liter&#8208;scale reactor, suggesting that it is a potential candidate for industrial PET depolymerization processes. The molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the distal substitutions stabilized the loops around the active sites and transmitted the stabilization effect to the active sites through enhancing inter&#8208;loop interactions network.

         <title>Managing Secondary Phase Lead Iodide in Hybrid Perovskites via Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Robust Environmental Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;reconstruction strategy that converts the excess unstable PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer on the surface of perovskite films by employing the rationally selected mediator of ((C2H5O)3Si(CH2)3NH3)2SO4 in toluene, has been used to stabilize the soft perovskite lattice for synchronously boosting the power conversion efficiency and environmental stability of perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Rationally managing the secondary&#8208;phase excess lead iodide (PbI2) in hybrid perovskite is of significance for pursuing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the challenge remains on its conversion to a homogeneous layer that is robust stable against environmental stimuli. We herein demonstrate an effective strategy of surface reconstruction that converts the excess PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer, which substantially stabilizes the perovskite film and reduces interfacial charge transfer barrier in the PSCs device. The perovskite films with such bi&#8208;layer could bear harsh conditions such as soaking in water, light illumination at 70&#8201;% relative humidity, and the damp&#8208;thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% humidity) environment. The resulted PSCs deliver a champion efficiency up to 24.09&#8201;%, as well as remarkable environmental stability, e.g., retaining 78&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 5500&#8197;h of shelf storage, and 82&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h of operational stability testing.

     alt="Managing Secondary Phase Lead Iodide in Hybrid Perovskites via Surface Reconstruction for High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Robust Environmental Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surface-reconstruction strategy that converts the excess unstable PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a gradient lead sulfate-silica bi-layer on the surface of perovskite films by employing the rationally selected mediator of ((C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in toluene, has been used to stabilize the soft perovskite lattice for synchronously boosting the power conversion efficiency and environmental stability of perovskite solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationally managing the secondary-phase excess lead iodide (PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in hybrid perovskite is of significance for pursuing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the challenge remains on its conversion to a homogeneous layer that is robust stable against environmental stimuli. We herein demonstrate an effective strategy of surface reconstruction that converts the excess PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a gradient lead sulfate-silica bi-layer, which substantially stabilizes the perovskite film and reduces interfacial charge transfer barrier in the PSCs device. The perovskite films with such bi-layer could bear harsh conditions such as soaking in water, light illumination at 70&#8201;% relative humidity, and the damp-thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% humidity) environment. The resulted PSCs deliver a champion efficiency up to 24.09&#8201;%, as well as remarkable environmental stability, e.g., retaining 78&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 5500&#8197;h of shelf storage, and 82&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h of operational stability testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NH4+ Deprotonation at Interfaces Induced Reversible H3O+/NH4+ Co&#8208;insertion/Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accumulation of NH4+ on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface was probed by in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR. The formed NH4+&#8208;rich domain induces the formation of protons. Subsequently, proton co&#8208;insertion into VO2 happens, which achieved fast ion storage (charge/discharge in &lt;20&#8197;s) and high capacity (&gt;300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and was revealed by in situ XRD and DFT calculation.







Abstract
Ion insertions always involve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface process, desolvation for instance, which determines the electrochemical kinetics. However, it&#8242;s still a challenge to achieve fast ion insertion and investigate ion transformation at interface. Herein, the interface deprotonation of NH4+ and the introduced dissociation of H2O molecules to provide sufficient H3O+ to insert into materials&#8242; structure for fast energy storages are revealed. Lewis acidic ion&#8208;NH4+ can, on one hand provide H3O+ itself via deprotonation, and on the other hand hydrolyze with H2O molecules to produce H3O+. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared ray method probed the interface accumulation and deprotonation of NH4+, and density functional theory calculations manifested that NH4+ tend to thermodynamically adsorb on the surface of monoclinic VO2, and deprotonate to provide H3O+. In addition, the inserted NH4+ has a positive effect for stabilizing the VO2(B) structure. Therefore, high specific capacity (&gt;300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and fast ionic insertion/extraction (&lt;20&#8197;s) can be realized in VO2(B) anode. This interface derivation proposes a new path for designing proton ion insertion/extraction in mild electrolyte.

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Charge Transport through Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkable enhancement of charge transport at a molecular junction is realized in pillar[5]arene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers through host&#8211;guest interactions with cationic guest molecules. The improved charge transport is positively correlated with the strong binding affinity between pillar[5]arene and cationic guest molecules, which results in a delocalized structure in the supramolecular complex and a reduced energy offset.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport is one of the essential modes for modulating charge transport in molecular electronic devices. Supermolecules are highly promising candidates for molecular devices because of their abundant structures and easy functionalization. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to enhance charge transport through pillar[5]arene self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by introducing cationic guests. The current density of pillar[5]arene SAMs can be raised up to about 2.1 orders of magnitude by inserting cationic molecules into the cavity of pillar[5]arenes in SAMs. Importantly, we have also observed a positive correlation between the charge transport of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complex SAMs and the binding affinities of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complexation. Such an enhancement of charge transport is attributed to the efficient host&#8211;guest interactions that stabilize the supramolecular complexes and lower the energy gaps for charge transport. This work provides a predictive pattern for the regulation of intermolecular charge transport in guiding the design of next generation switches and functional sensors in supramolecular electronics.

         <title>The Origin of Solvent Deprotonation in LiI&#8208;added Aprotic Electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamentals behind undesirable side reactions (solvent deprotonation) in LiI&#8208;added Li&#8208;O2 batteries have been controversial since LiI was reported to enable 4e&#8722; redox reactions in 2015. However, LiBr is free from such issues. Here, we predict and confirm that it is the side product (
 that triggers the solvent deprotonation.







Abstract
LiI and LiBr have been employed as soluble redox mediators (RMs) in electrolytes to address the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction kinetics during charging in aprotic Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Compared to LiBr, LiI exhibits a redox potential closer to the theoretical one of discharge products, indicating a higher energy efficiency. However, the reason for the occurrence of solvent deprotonation in LiI&#8208;added electrolytes remains unclear. Here, by combining ab initio calculations and experimental validation, we find that it is the nucleophile 
 that triggers the solvent deprotonation and LiOH formation via nucleophilic attack, rather than the increased solvent acidity or the elongated C&#8722;H bond as previously suggested. As a comparison, the formation of 
 in LiBr&#8208;added electrolytes is found to be thermodynamically unfavorable, explaining the absence of LiOH formation. These findings provide important insight into the solvent deprotonation and pave the way for the practical application of LiI RM in aprotic Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>A Photoisomerizable Zinc (II) Complex Inhibits Microtubule Polymerization for Photoactive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights a photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex (Zn1), which has a promising application prospect in photoactive therapy through photoisomerization. Zn1 can release its trans ligand after light irradiation, undergo photoisomerization to produce toxic cis product and generate 1O2 in the meantime. The series of changes lead to photo&#8208;triggered toxicity against cancer cells and cause microtubule breakdown.







Abstract
The photoisomerization&#8208;induced cytotoxicity in photopharmacology provides a unique pathway for phototherapy because it is independent of endogenous oxygen. In this study, we developed a biosafe photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex (Zn1), which releases its trans ligand (trans&#8208;L1) after being irradiated with blue light. This causes the complex to undergo photoisomerization and produce the toxic cis product (cis&#8208;L1) and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). The resulting series of events caused impressive phototoxicity in hypoxic A431 skin cancer cells, as well as in a tumor model in vivo. Interestingly, Zn1 was able to inhibit tumor microtubule polymerization, while still showing good biocompatibility and biosafety in vivo. This photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex provides a novel strategy for addressing the oxygen&#8208;dependent limitation of traditional photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Immunogenic Cell Death Inducing Metal Complexes for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Recent statistics have shown that metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. While traditional treatments are able to efficiently remove the primary tumor, secondary tumors remain poorly accessible. Capitalizing on this there is an urgent need for novel treatment modalities. Among the most promising approaches, increasing research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Preliminary studies have shown that immunogenic cell death inducing compounds could be able to overcome metastatic and relapsing tumors. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death inducing compounds is systematically reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct N&#8211;H Activation to Generate Nitrogen Radical for Arylamine Synthesis via&#160;Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Represented herein is the first example of N&#8208;radicals generation direct from N&#8211;H bonds activation under mild and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;radical intercepts a reduced heteroarylnitrile/aryl halide for C&#8211;N bond formation under visible light irradiation of quantum dots (QDs). A series of aryl and alkylamines with heteroarylnitriles/aryl halides exhibit high efficiency, site&#8208;selectivity and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, consecutive C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bond formation using benzylamines as substrates is also achieved, producing N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines with H2 evolution. The redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad substrate scope, and efficiency of N&#8208;radical formation are advantageous for organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tricrilactones A&#8722;H, Potent Antiosteoporosis Macrolides with Distinctive Ring Skeletons from Trichocladium crispatum, an Alpine Moss&#8208;Associated Fungus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tricrilactones A&#8722;H (1&#8722;8), a new family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides featuring collectively five unique ring skeletons, were isolated from a hitherto unexplored fungus, Trichocladium crispatum. Compounds 1 and 7 represent two unconventional bridged (aza)tricyclic core skeletons, 2&#8722;3 and 5&#8722;6 share an undescribed tetracyclic 9/5/6/6 ring system, 4 bears an uncommon 9/5/6/10/3&#8208;fused pentacyclic architecture, and 8 is a dimer bridged by an unexpected C&#8722;C linkage. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated via spectroscopic analysis, quantum chemical calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Importantly, the absolute configuration of the highly flexible side chain of 1 was resolved by the asymmetric synthesis of its four stereoisomers. The intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments facilitated the proposal of the biosynthetic pathway for these macrolides. In addition, their antiosteoporosis effects were evaluated in vivo (zebrafish).</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Potassium Batteries Enabled by electric and Thermal Field Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recharging batteries operate at sub&#8208;zero temperature is usually limited by the slow ion diffusion and uneven charge distribution at low temperature. Here, we report a strategy to regulate electric field and thermal field simultaneously, creating a fast and uniform deposition surroundings for potassium ion in potassium metal batteries (PMBs). This regulation is achieved by using a highly ordered 1D nanoarray electrode which provides a dense and flat surface for uniforming the electric field and high thermal conductivity for reducing the temperature fluctuation. Consequently, this electrode could achieve high&#8208;areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Besides, the dependence of potassium nucleation on temperature is unveiled. Furthermore, a full&#8208;cell could steady operate with over 80% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8208;20&#176;C. Those respectable performances demonstrate that this strategy is valid, potentially providing guidelines for the rational design of advanced electrodes toward PMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>ATRP enhances structural correlations in polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic methods to control the structure of materials at sub&#8208;micron&#160; scales are typically based on the self&#8208;assembly of structural building blocks with precise size and morphology. On the other hand, many living systems can generate structure across a broad range of length scales in one step directly from macromolecules, using phase separation. Here, we introduce and control structure at the nano&#8208; and microscales through polymerization in the solid state, which has the unusual capability of both triggering and arresting phase separation.&#160;In particular, we show that atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) enables control of nucleation, growth, and stabilization of phase&#8208;separated poly&#8208;methylmethacrylate (PMMA) domains in a solid polystyrene (PS) matrix. ATRP yields durable nanostructures with low size dispersity and high degrees of structural correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the length scale of these materials is controlled by the synthesis parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>When It&#8217;s Heavier: Interfacial and Solvation Chemistry of Isotopes in Aqueous Electrolytes for Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical effect of isotope (EEI) of water is introduced in the Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) electrolyte to deal with the challenge of severe side reactions and massive gas production. Due to the low diffusion and strong coordination of ions in D2O, the possibility of side reactions is decreased, resulting in a broader electrochemically stable potential window, less pH change, and less zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) generation during cycling. Moreover, we demonstrate that D2O eliminates the different ZHS phases generated by the change of bound water during cycling because of the consistently low local ion and molecule concentration, resulting in a stable interface between the electrode and electrolyte. The full cells with D2O&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrated more stable cycling performance which displayed ~100% reversible efficiencies after 1,000 cycles with a wide voltage window of 0.8&#8208;2.0 V and 3,000 cycles with a normal voltage window of 0.8&#8208;1.9 V at a current density of 2 A g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic activation of Ga sites by Pt dopant in low temperature liquid metal catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid GaPt catalysts with Pt&#160;concentrations as low as 1&#215;10&#8722;4 atomic % have recently been identified as highly active for the oxidation of methanol and pyrogallol under mild reaction conditions. However, almost nothing is known about how liquid state catalysts support these significant improvements in activity. Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine GaPt catalysts in isolation and interacting with adsorbates. We find that persistent geometric features can exist in the liquid state, given the correct environment. We postulate that the Pt dopant may not be limited to being directly involved in catalysis of reactions, but rather that its presence can enable Ga atoms to also become catalytically active.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Precursor&#8208;Guided Phase Engineering of Single&#8208;Crystal VO2 Beams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of VO2 flourishes due to its rich competing phases induced by slight stoichiometry variations. However, the vague mechanism of stoichiometry manipulation makes the precise phase engineering of VO2 still challenging. Here, stoichiometry manipulation of single&#8208;crystal VO2 beams in liquid&#8208;assisted growth is systematically studied. Contrary to previous experience, oxygen&#8208;rich VO2 phases are abnormally synthesized under a reduced oxygen concentration, revealing the important function of liquid V2O5 precursor: It submerges VO2 crystals and stabilizes their stoichiometric phase (M1) by isolating them from the reactive atmosphere, while the uncovered crystals are oxidized by the growth atmosphere. By varying the thickness of liquid V2O5 precursor and thus the exposure time of VO2 to the atmosphere, various VO2 phases (M1, T, and M2) can be selectively stabilized. Furthermore, this liquid precursor&#8208;guided growth can be used to spatially manages multiphase structures in single VO2 beams, enriching their deformation modes for actuation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrochemical Nanosensor for Monitoring the Dynamics of Intracellular H2O2 Upon NADH Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactiveoxygen species (ROS)&#8208;based therapeutic strategies play an important role in cancer treatment. However, in situ, real&#8208;time and quantitative analysis of intracellular ROS in cancer treatment for drug screening is still a challenge. Herein we report one selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical nanosensor, which is prepared by electrodeposition of Prussian blue (PB) and polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) onto carbon fiber nanoelectrode. With the nanosensor, we find that the level of intracellular H2O2 increases with NADH treatment and that increase is dose&#8208;dependent to the concentration of NADH. High&#8208;dose of NADH (above 10 mM) can induce cell death and intratumoral injection of NADH is validated for inhibiting tumor growth in mice. This study highlights the potential of electrochemical nanosensor for tracking and understanding the role of H2O2 in screening new anticancer drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfimides through the O&#8208;Alkylation of Enantioenriched Sulfinamides and Addition of Carbon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral sulfimides, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfoxides, are valuable compounds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient method for preparing chiral sulfimides from easily available enantioenriched sulfinamides. The key step of this method is a stereospecific oxygen&#8208;selective alkylation of enantioenriched sulfinamides, which is accomplished by using isopropyl iodide, K2CO3, and DMPU. The resulting chiral sulfinimidate esters are transformed to chiral sulfimides by the nucleophilic addition of the Grignard reagents under simple conditions. This transformation enables access to the enantioenriched diaryl or dialkyl sulfimides bearing two similar carbon substituents, which are difficult to synthesize by previous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivities of &#945;&#8208;Oxo BMIDA Gold Carbenes Generated by Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of BMIDA&#8208;Terminated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An oxidative strategy is reported to access &#945;&#8208;oxo BMIDA gold carbenes directly from BMIDA&#8208;terminated alkynes. Besides offering expedient access to seldom studied boryl metal carbenes, these BMIDA gold carbene species undergo facile insertions into methylene, methine, and benzylic C&#8208;H bonds in the absence of the Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect. They also undergo efficient OH insertion, cyclopropanation, and F&#8208;C alkylations. This chemistry provides rapid access to structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;BMIDA ketones, which are scarcely documented. &#160;In combination with DFT studies, the role of BMIDA is established to be an electron&#8208;donating group that attenuates the high electrophilicity of the gold carbene center.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of Homochiral Titanium&#8211;Organic Cages for Recognition and Separation of Molecular Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) was extended and fixed into a porous framework using a post&#8208;assembly modification strategy, which made it easier to study the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the solid&#8208;state MOC using a single&#8208;crystal diffraction technique. Anionic Ti4L6 (L = embonate) cage can be used as a 4&#8208;connecting crystal engineering tecton, and its optical resolution was achieved, thus homochiral &#916;&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208; and &#923;&#923;&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ti4L6] cages were obtained. Accordingly, a pair of homochiral cage&#8208;based microporous frameworks (PTC&#8208;236(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;236(&#923;)) were easily prepared via a post&#8208;assembly reaction. PTC&#8208;236 has rich recognition sites provided by the Ti4L6 moieties, chiral channels and high framework stability, affording a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation for guest structure analyses. Thus it was successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules. This study provides a new approach for the orderly combination of well&#8208;defined MOCs into functional porous frameworks.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8208;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4&#8208;palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5&#8208;palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5&#8208;palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a Pd(IV) intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Stable Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes with Barium [2.2.2]Cryptate Cations: The Importance of High Binding Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of cationic functional groups is one of the key factors determining lifetime of alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEMs) and the AAEM&#8208;based electrochemical devices. Main&#8208;group metal and crown ether complexes are stable cations due to the absence of degradation pathways including nucleophilic substitution, Hofmann elimination, and cation redox. However, the binding strength, a key feature for AAEM applications, is overlooked in previous work. We herein propose the use of barium [2.2.2]cryptate ([Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+) as a new cationic functional group for AAEMs due to its extremely strong binding (109.5 M&#8211;1 in water at 25 &#176;C). The [Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+&#8208;AAEMs with polyolefin backbones remain stable after treatment in 15 M KOH at 60 &#176;C for over 1500 hours. More importantly, these AAEMs are successfully applied in water electrolyzers, and an anolyte&#8208;feeding switch method is designed to further reveal the influence of binding constants.</dc:description>

         <title>New Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes with High Lithium Ionic Conductivity &gt;10&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M=Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Nb and 12.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant interest as next&#8208;generation energy storage. Halides such as Li3YCl6 are promising candidates for SE because they combine high oxidation stability and deformability. However, the ionic conductivities of halide SEs are not as high as those of other SEs, especially sulfides. Here, we discover new lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;oxy&#8208;halide materials, LiMOCl4 (M=Nb, Ta). They exhibit extremely high ionic conductivities of 10.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Nb and 12.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for M=Ta, respectively, even in cold&#8208;pressed powder forms at room temperature, which are comparable to or surpass those of organic liquid electrolytes used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Bulk&#8208;type ASSB cells using the oxyhalides as the cathode SE demonstrate an outstanding rate capability with a capacity retention of 80&#8201;% at 5&#8197;C/0.1&#8197;C. We believe that the proposed oxyhalides are promising SE candidates for the practical applications of ASSBs.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Fueled Transient Breathing Nanogels that Couple Nonequilibrium Catalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer nanogel can perform polymerization with every breath it takes. CO2 bind to the nanogel activates its catalytic capacity and initiate a CO2&#8208;involved nonequilibrium polymerization that reversely depletes the fuel. This transient system can be function as gas&#8208;powered nanosynthesizer for automatic production of polymer on&#8208;demand.







Abstract
Here we present a &#8220;breathing&#8221; nanogel that is fueled by CO2 gas to perform temporally programmable catalytic polymerization. The nanogel is composed of common frustrated Lewis pair polymers (FLPs). Dynamic CO2&#8208;FLP gas&#8208;bridging bonds endow the nanogel with a transient volume contraction, and the resulting proximal effect of bound FLPs unlocks its catalytic capacity toward CO2. Reverse gas depletion via a CO2&#8208;participated polymerization can induce a reverse nanogel expansion, which shuts down the catalytic activity. Control of external factors (fuel level, temperature or additives) can regulate the breathing period, amplitude and lifecycle, so as to affect the catalytic polymerization. Moreover, editing the nanogel breathing procedure can sequentially evoke the copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxide monomers preloaded therein, which allows to obtain block&#8208;tunable copolycarbonates that are unachievable by other methods. This synthetic dissipative system would be function as a prototype of gas&#8208;driven nanosynthesizer.

         <title>Synthesis of Bioctacene&#8208;Incorporated Nanographene with Near&#8208;Infrared Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzoperihexacene (HBPH) with two incorporated octacene moieties has been synthesized. The two enantiomers of HPPH showed circular dichroism in the visible to NIR regions as well as an emission maximum at 798&#8197;nm with an absolute PLQY of 41&#8201;%. Analysis of the excited&#8208;state photophysical properties revealed an intriguing feature that was attributed to the rotational and/or conformational dynamics of HBPH after excitation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a hexabenzoperihexacene (HBPH) with two incorporated octacene substructures, which was unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The theoretical isomerization barrier of the (P,P)&#8208;/(P,M)&#8208;forms was estimated to be 38.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and resolution was achieved by chiral HPLC. Notably, the enantiomers exhibited opposite circular dichroism responses up to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (830&#8197;nm) with a high gabs value of 0.017 at 616&#8197;nm. Moreover, HBPH demonstrated NIR emission with a maximum at 798&#8197;nm and an absolute PLQY of 41&#8201;%. The excited&#8208;state photophysical properties of HBPH were investigated by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, revealing an intriguing feature that was attributed to the rotational and/or conformational dynamics of HBPH after excitation. These results provide new insight into the design of chiral nanographene with NIR optical properties for potential chiroptical applications.

         <title>Optically Controlled Recovery and Recycling of Homogeneous Organocatalysts Enabled by Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable organocatalysts have been generated that undergo reversible dissolution and precipitation upon photo&#8208;irradiation. The insoluble solid&#8208;state catalysts are photo&#8208;switched to form soluble isomers that activate and complete two types of base&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Irradiation with visible light promotes the precipitation of the catalyst with a recovery rate of 87&#8201;%, which can be reused in multiple rounds of subsequent reactions.







Abstract
We address a critical challenge of recovering and recycling homogeneous organocatalysts by designing photoswitchable catalyst structures that display a reversible solubility change in response to light. Initially insoluble catalysts are UV&#8208;switched to a soluble isomeric state, which catalyzes the reaction, then back&#8208;isomerizes to the insoluble state upon completion of the reaction to be filtered and recycled. The molecular design principles that allow for the drastic solubility change over 10 times between the isomeric states, 87&#8201;% recovery by the light&#8208;induced precipitation, and multiple rounds of catalyst recycling are revealed. This proof of concept will open up opportunities to develop highly recyclable homogeneous catalysts that are important for the synthesis of critical compounds in various industries, which is anticipated to significantly reduce environmental impact and costs.

         <title>A Pair of Interconverting Cages Formed from Achiral Precursors Spontaneously Resolve into Homochiral Conformers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From achiral precursors homochirality can be achieved by first forming a pair of enantiomers without inversion center or mirror image (mathematical criterium), followed with their narcissistic self&#8208;sorting driven by multivalent intermolecular interactions that follow the helical trajectory of screw symmetry of the resulting enantiopure crystals (chemical criterium).







Abstract
Without chiral induction the emergence of homochirality from achiral molecules is rather serendipitous, as the rationale is somewhat ambiguous. We herein provide a plausible solution. From achiral precursors are formed a pair of interconverting cage conformers that exhibit a C3&#8208;axis as the only symmetry element. When their interconversion is impeded with intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, each conformer self&#8208;sorts into a homochiral crystal, which is driven by a helical network of multivalent intermolecular interactions during the self&#8208;assembly of homochiral cage conformers. As no chiral induction is involved throughout, we believe our study could enlighten the rational design for the emergence of homochirality with several criteria: 1) formation of a molecule without inversion center or mirror plane; 2) suppression of the enantiomeric interconversion, and introduction of multivalent interactions along the helical trajectory of screw symmetry within the resulting superstructure.

         <title>Modulating the Differentiation of Kinetically Controlled Supramolecular Polymerizations through the Alkyl Bridge Length</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;annulated perylene bisimides (N&#8208;PBIs) has demonstrated that the ability of these units to generate different polymorphs upon supramolecular polymerization decreases as the length of the alkyl bridge separating the peripheral side chains and the central aromatic backbones decreases. The kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization of these N&#8208;PBIs has also been investigated.







Abstract
The synthesis and self&#8208;assembling features of N&#8208;annulated perylenebisimides (N&#8208;PBIs) 2&#8211;4 are reported and compared with the complex self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;PBI 1. The studies presented herein demonstrate that increasing the length of the alkyl spacer separating the central aromatic core of the dye and the peripheral side chains cancels the differentiation on the corresponding supramolecular polymerization. Thus, only 2 is able to form two different supramolecular polymorphs. The formation of kinetically trapped monomeric species is observed for all the N&#8208;PBIs 2&#8211;4. These metastable species, constituted by intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles of 7, 8, 9, or 10 members for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, provoke kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerizations that can be accelerated by the addition of seeds. The results presented herein shed light on the intricate process of differentiation in self&#8208;assembly.

Abstract
Metallic conductive 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been identified as promising anode for sodium ion (Na+) batteries, but its metastable feature makes it difficult to obtain and its restacking during the charge/discharge processing result in part capacity reversibility. Herein, a synergetic effect of atomic&#8208;interface engineering is employed for constructing 2H&#8208;MoS2 layers assembled on single atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C (SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) anode material that boosts its reversible capacity. The work&#8208;function&#8208;driven&#8208;electron transfer occurs from SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C to 2H&#8208;MoS2 via the Fe&#8722;S bonds, which enhances the adsorption of Na+ by 2H&#8208;MoS2, and lays the foundation for the sodiation process. A phase transfer from 2H to 1T/2H MoS2 with the ferromagnetic spin&#8208;polarization of SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C occurs during the sodiation/desodiation process, which significantly enhances the Na+ storage kinetics, and thus the 1T/2H MoS2/SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C display a high electronic conductivity and a fast Na+ diffusion rate.

         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen activation and addition to unsaturated substrates such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes mediated by transition metal complexes efficiently afford a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products.







Abstract
Dinitrogen (N2) activation and functionalization is of fundamental interest and practical importance. This review focuses on N2 activation and addition to unsaturated substrates, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, heteroallenes, aldehydes, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes, mediated by transition metal complexes, which afforded a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products. Emphases are placed on the reaction modes and mechanisms. We hope that this work would stimulate further explorations in this challenging field.

         <title>A Bidentate Ligand Featuring Ditopic Lewis Acids in the Second Sphere for Selective Substrate Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a bidentate ligand featuring secondary sphere ditopic Lewis acids. We verify a Lewis acid additivity effect for the ditopic boranes compared to a monotopic analogue using hydride ion affinity and competition studies. We show chemoselective nitrite capture in the presence of other anions. Pre&#8208;organized hydrazine adducts in the second sphere of Zn and Fe are functionalized to hydrazido and diazene ligands, respectively.







Abstract
We present a ligand platform featuring appended ditopic Lewis acids to facilitate capture/activation of diatomic substrates. We show that incorporation of two 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN) units on a single carbon tethered to a pyridine pyrazole scaffold maintains a set of unquenched nitrogen donors available to coordinate FeII, ZnII, and NiII. Using hydride ion affinity and competition experiments, we establish an additive effect for ditopic secondary sphere boranes, compared to the monotopic analogue. These effects are exploited to achieve high selectivity for binding NO2&#8722; in the presence of competitive anions such as F&#8722; and NO3&#8722;. Finally, we demonstrate hydrazine capture within the second&#8208;sphere of metal complexes, followed by unique activation pathways to generate hydrazido and diazene ligands on Zn and Fe, respectively.

         <title>Engineering a Copper Single&#8208;Atom Electron Bridge to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) were constructed at the contact interface between Cu1/MoS2 and MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 to achieve a highly active and stable catalyst for CO2 photoreduction. Empowered by the N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S SAEB species, the Z&#8208;Scheme charge&#8208;transfer process was significantly promoted, leading to enhancement of the photocatalytic CO2RR.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and stable photocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a great challenge. We designed a Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst with N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S single&#8208;atom electron bridge (denoted as Cu&#8208;SAEB), which was used to mediate the CO2RR. The production of CO and O2 over Cu&#8208;SAEB is as high as 236.0 and 120.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the absence of sacrificial agents, respectively, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts. Notably, the as&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;SAEB is highly stable throughout 30 reaction cycles, totaling 300&#8197;h, owing to the strengthened contact interface of Cu&#8208;SAEB, and mediated by the N&#8722;Cu1&#8722;S atomic structure. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicated that the SAEB greatly promoted the Z&#8208;scheme interfacial charge&#8208;transport process, thus leading to great enhancement of the photocatalytic CO2RR of Cu&#8208;SAEB. This work represents a promising platform for the development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts that have potential in CO2 conversion applications.

This work represents a promising platform for the development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts that have potential in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Metal&#8208;Quinone Networks with Tunable Architecture and Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of tubes, particles, capsules, and thin films has been developed using the modular coordination&#8208;driven assembly of metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs). The MQNs show versatile adhesion to diverse substrates and bidirectional pH&#8208;responsive disassembly with ligand&#8208;mediated kinetics. The incorporated medicinal properties of quinones enable their potential use as prodrugs in specific areas (e.g., cancer and Mpro inhibition in coronaviruses).







Abstract
Nanostructured materials with tunable structures and functionality are of interest in diverse areas. Herein, metal ions are coordinated with quinones through metal&#8208;acetylacetone coordination bonds to generate a class of structurally tunable, universally adhesive, hydrophilic, and pH&#8208;degradable materials. A library of metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs) is produced from five model quinone ligands paired with nine metal ions, leading to the assembly of particles, tubes, capsules, and films. Importantly, MQNs show bidirectional pH&#8208;responsive disassembly in acidic and alkaline solutions, where the quinone ligands mediate the disassembly kinetics, enabling temporal and spatial control over the release of multiple components using multilayered MQNs. Leveraging this tunable release and the inherent medicinal properties of quinones, MQN prodrugs with a high drug loading (&gt;89&#8197;wt&#8201;%) are engineered using doxorubicin for anti&#8208;cancer therapy and shikonin for the inhibition of the main protease in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.

         <title>An Isotope&#8208;Labeled Single&#8208;Cell Raman Spectroscopy Approach for Tracking the Physiological Evolution Trajectory of Bacteria toward Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis and genotypic profiling was developed to in situ track the highly heterogeneous and dynamic physiological evolution trajectory of bacteria toward antibiotic resistance. The physiological diversification of single cells into four subpopulations preceding resistance from an isogeneic population was sensitively captured and their dynamic shift was tracked.







Abstract
Understanding evolution of antibiotic resistance is vital for containing its global spread. Yet our ability to in situ track highly heterogeneous and dynamic evolution is very limited. Here, we present a new single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis, and genotypic profiling to in situ track physiological evolution trajectory toward resistance. Physiological diversification of individual cells from isogenic population with cyclic ampicillin treatment is captured. Advanced multivariate analysis of spectral changes classifies all individual cells into four subsets of sensitive, intrinsic tolerant, evolved tolerant and resistant. Remarkably, their dynamic shifts with evolution are depicted and spectral markers of each state are identified. Genotypic analysis validates the phenotypic shift and provides insights into the underlying genetic basis. The new platform advances rapid phenotyping resistance evolution and guides evolution control.

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Enabling High Overall Nitrogen Fixation Performance for Atomically Dispersed Fe on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was further involved to inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for superior nitrogen fixation performance.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed Fe was designed on TiO2 and explored as a Janus electrocatalyst for both nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in a two&#8208;electrode system. Pulsed electrochemical catalysis (PE) was firstly involved to inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Excitingly, an unanticipated yield of 7055.81&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1cat. and 12&#8201;868.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1cat. were obtained for NOR and NRR at 3.5&#8197;V, respectively, 44.94 times and 7.8 times increase in FE than the conventional constant voltage electrocatalytic method. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the single&#8208;atom Fe could stabilize the oxygen vacancy, lower the energy barrier for the vital rupture of N&#8801;N, and result in enhanced N2 fixation performance. More importantly, PE could effectively enhance the N2 supply by reducing competitive O2 and H2 agglomeration, inhibit the electrocatalytic by&#8208;product formation for longstanding *OOH and *H intermediates, and promote the non&#8208;electrocatalytic process of N2 activation.

         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation of porphine has led to the synthesis of the useful synthon 2,7,12,17&#8208;tetrakis(pinacolatoboryl) NiII porphyrin. This synthon was used for the preparation of tetraarylated NiII porphyrins, octaarylated NiII porphyrins, a quadruply bridged non&#8208;offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face porphyrin dimer, single&#8208;linked cross&#8208;shaped porphyrin pentamers and nonamers, as well as pentameric porphyrin tapes.







Abstract
2,7,12,17&#8208;Tetrakis(pinacolatoboryl) NiII porphyrin 5&#8201;Ni was synthesized in 75&#8201;% yield by Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation of porphine followed by NiII metalation and has been demonstrated to be a useful synthon, giving 2,7,12,17&#8208;tetraaryated NiII porphyrins 6&#8201;a&#8211;d, peripherally octaarylated NiII porphyrins 8&#8201;a&#8211;d, quadruply bridged face&#8208;to&#8208;face non&#8208;offset NiII&#8208;porphyrin dimer 12, and cross&#8208;shaped &#946;&#8208;meso singly linked porphyrin pentamers and nonamers. Oxidation of cross&#8208;shaped &#946;&#8208;meso singly linked porphyrin pentamers 14&#8201;Ni and 14&#8201;Zn gave fused pentameric tapes 15&#8201;Ni and 15&#8201;Zn. The structures of 12, 14&#8201;Zn, and 15&#8201;Ni have been revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Optical separation of 12 has been accomplished, showing a bisignate coupling pattern for exciton&#8208;coupled blue&#8208;shifted Soret band.

&lt;p&gt;The Ir-catalyzed borylation of porphine has led to the synthesis of the useful synthon 2,7,12,17-tetrakis(pinacolatoboryl) Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrin. This synthon was used for the preparation of tetraarylated Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrins, octaarylated Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrins, a quadruply bridged non-offset face-to-face porphyrin dimer, single-linked cross-shaped porphyrin pentamers and nonamers, as well as pentameric porphyrin tapes.

         <title>Ligand Assisted Thermal Atomization of Palladium Clusters: An Inspiring Approach for the Rational Design of Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation from metal nanocluster catalysts to metal single&#8208;atom catalysts is an important procedure in the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs). Herein, an inspiring approach is reported. Cl ligands coordinated to Pd nanoclusters make them become less stable and have a stronger tendency to collapse, thus allowing the transformation from Pd nanocluster to Pd single atom to happen at a relative low temperature.







Abstract
The transformation from metal nanocluster catalysts to metal single&#8208;atom catalysts is an important procedure in the rational design of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs). However, the conversion methods often involve high annealing temperature as well as reducing atmosphere. Herein, we reported a continuous and convenient approach to transfer Pd nanocluster into Pd single&#8208;atom in a ligand assisted annealing procedure, by which means we reduced its activating temperature low to 400&#8201;&#176;C. Using ex&#8208;situ microscopy and spectroscopy, we comprehensively monitored the structural evolution of Pd species though the whole atomization process. Theoretical calculation revealed that the structural instability caused by remaining Cl ligands was the main reason for this low&#8208;temperature transformation. The present atomization strategy and mechanistic knowledge for the conversion from cluster to atomic dispersion provides guidelines for the rational design of ADCs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Emerging Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear optics (NLO) is a field of immense importance owing to its usefulness in lasing, bio&#8208;imaging, etc. In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a potential class of NLO materials. This Minireview presents an overview of the principles of NLO, a discussion on various aspects of designing COFs for NLO, and a summary of important real&#8208;life applications of COFs based on their NLO response.







Abstract
The vastness of organic synthetic strategies and knowledge of reticular chemistry have made covalent organic frameworks (COFs) one of the most chemically and structurally diverse class of materials with potential applications ranging from gas storage, molecular separation, and catalysis to energy storage and magnetism. Recently, this class of porous materials has garnered increasing interest as potential nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Traditionally, inorganic crystals, small&#8208;molecule organic chromophores, and oligomers have been studied for their NLO response. Nevertheless, COFs offer significant advantages over existing NLO materials in terms of higher mechanical strength, thermochemical stability, and extended conjugation. Herein, we discuss crucial aspects, terminology, and measurement techniques related to NLO, followed by a critical analysis of the design principles for COFs with NLO response. Furthermore, we touch on selected potential applications of these NLO materials. Finally, future prospects and challenges of COFs as NLO materials are discussed.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs for Targeted Degradation of Extracellular and Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer&#8208;LYTACs have been developed to realize liver&#8208;cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GalNAc. This platform can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through the lysosomal degradation pathway, providing a new method for targeted protein degradation.







Abstract
Recently, lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have emerged as a promising technology that expands the scope of targeted protein degradation to extracellular targets. However, the preparation of chimeras by conjugation of the antibody and trivalent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (tri&#8208;GalNAc) is a complex and time&#8208;consuming process. The large uncertainty in number and position and the large molecular weights of the chimeras result in low internalization efficiency. To circumvent these problems, we developed the first aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (Apt&#8208;LYTAC) to realize liver&#8208;cell&#8208;specific degradation of extracellular and membrane proteins by conjugating aptamers to tri&#8208;GalNAc. Taking advantage of the facile synthesis and low molecular weight of the aptamer, the Apt&#8208;LYTACs can efficiently and quickly degrade the extracellular protein PDGF and the membrane protein PTK7 through a lysosomal degradation pathway. We anticipate that the novel Apt&#8208;LYTACs will expand the usage of aptamers and provide a new dimension for targeted protein degradation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization has been developed that can proceed quickly under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest the Michael addition controls the kinetic of the propagation process. In addition, this new polymerization can be spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, and the resulting polymers can be directly used for polymer ligations.







Abstract
The development of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization is challenging yet desirable in modern polymer chemistry. In this work, we reported a novel chain&#8208;growth click polymerization based on the thiol&#8208;Michael reaction. This polymerization could be performed efficiently under ambient conditions and spatiotemporally regulated by ultraviolet light, allowing the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers in excellent yields and high molecular weights. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the thiolate addition to the Michael acceptor is the rate&#8208;determining step, and introducing the phenyl group could facilitate the chain&#8208;growth process. This polymerization is a new type of chain&#8208;growth click polymerization, which will provide a unique approach to creating functional polymers.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Atomically Dispersed Sn Protuberance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by a special coordination with substrate C and O was designed. This unique structure could induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and thus the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) performance. As a result, the obtained Sn ADPs displayed an outstanding electrocatalytic activity, high selectivity stability, and durability in the NRR.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts show potential advantages in N2 reduction reaction (NRR) due to their excellent activity and efficient metal utilization. Unfortunately, the reported catalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory NRR activity due to their poor N2 adsorption and activation. Herein, we report a novel Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by coordination with substrate C and O to induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N2 adsorption, activation and NRR performance. The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra confirmed the local coordination structure of the Sn ADPs. NRR activity was significantly promoted via Sn ADPs, exhibiting a remarkable NH3 yield (RNH3) of 28.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (7447&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgSn&#8722;1) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the enhanced N2Hx intermediates was verified by in situ experiments, yielding consistent results with DFT calculation. This work opens a new avenue to regulate the activity and selectivity of N2 fixation.

This unique structure could induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, activation and thus the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (NRR) performance. As a result, the obtained Sn ADPs displayed an outstanding electrocatalytic activity, high selectivity stability, and durability in the NRR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed metal catalysts show potential advantages in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (NRR) due to their excellent activity and efficient metal utilization. Unfortunately, the reported catalysts usually exhibit unsatisfactory NRR activity due to their poor N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation. Herein, we report a novel Sn atomically dispersed protuberance (ADP) by coordination with substrate C and O to induce positive charge accumulation on Sn site for improving its N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, activation and NRR performance. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra confirmed the local coordination structure of the Sn ADPs. NRR activity was significantly promoted via Sn ADPs, exhibiting a remarkable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;) of 28.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (7447&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Sn&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V. Furthermore, the enhanced N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates was verified by in situ experiments, yielding consistent results with DFT calculation. This work opens a new avenue to regulate the activity and selectivity of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Helicity Induction and Memory in Polyallene toward Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Helicity Discrimination, and Enantiomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of racemic polymers were induced into one&#8208;handed helices and was memorized after the chiral inducer was removed. The enantiomeric excess of one handed helix (eeh) is up to 98&#8201;%. Interestingly, the switchable helix&#8208;induction are visible by naked eye. Moreover, the one&#8208;handed helices exhibit enhanced stability with helicity discrimination and enantiomer separation abilities.







Abstract
Inspired by biological helices (e.g., DNA), artificial helical polymers have attracted intense attention. However, precise synthesis of one&#8208;handed helices from achiral materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a series of achiral poly(biphenyl allene)s with controlled molar mass and low dispersity were prepared and induced into one&#8208;handed helices using chiral amines and alcohols. The induced one&#8208;handed helix was simultaneously memorized, even after the chiral inducer was removed. The switchable induction processes were visible to naked eye; the achiral polymers exhibited blue emission (irradiated at 365&#8197;nm), whereas the induced one&#8208;handed helices exhibited cyan emission with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The induced helices formed stable gels in various solvents with helicity discrimination ability: the same&#8208;handed helix gels were self&#8208;healing, whereas the gels of opposite&#8208;handed helicity were self&#8208;sorted. Moreover, the induced helices could separate enantiomers via enantioselective crystallization with high efficiency and switchable enantioselectivity.

         <title>Simultaneous co&#8208;Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Ethanol Oxidation towards Synergistic Acetaldehyde Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox system that can simultaneous use photoinduced electrons and holes for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled with selectivity ethanol oxidation to one identical value&#8208;added CH3CHO product is realized on Rb and K co&#8208;modified carbon nitride catalyst, with a benchmark C2 product yield and near&#8208;ideal atomic economy.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 is of great interest but it often suffers sluggish oxidation half reaction and undesired by&#8208;products. Here, we report for the first the simultaneous co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction and ethanol oxidation towards one identical value&#8208;added CH3CHO product on a rubidium and potassium co&#8208;modified carbon nitride (CN&#8208;KRb). The CN&#8208;KRb offers a record photocatalytic activity of 1212.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% for CH3CHO production, outperforming all the state&#8208;of&#8208;art CO2 photocatalysts. It is disclosed that the introduced Rb boosts the *OHCCHO fromation and facilitates the CH3CHO desorption, while K promotes ethanol adsorption and activation. Moreover, the H+ stemming from ethanol oxidation is confirmed to participate in the CO2 reduction process, endowing near ideal overall atomic economy. This work provides a new strategy for effective use of the photoexcited electron and hole for high selective and sustainable conversion of CO2 paired with oxidation reaction into identical product.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids by Manganese Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Primary Alcohols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis of highly demanded &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids via dehydrogenative coupling of two feedstock chemicals, ethylene glycol, and primary alcohols, is reported. An Earth's abundant metal complex catalyzes the reaction with high yields and selectivities. Water and hydrogen gas are produced as the sole byproducts.







Abstract
Herein, we report a straightforward synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid molecules via an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and primary alcohols. A bench&#8208;stable manganese complex catalyzed the reaction, which is scalable, with the product being isolated with high yields and selectivities under mild conditions. The protocol is environmentally benign, producing water and hydrogen gas as the only byproducts. Methanol can also be used as a C1 source for producing the platform molecule lactic acid, with a high turnover of &gt;104. The methodology was also used to functionalize alcohols derived from natural products and fatty acids. Furthermore, it was applied for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;amino acid, &#945;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acid, and several drugs and bioactive molecules, including endogenous metabolites, Danshensu, Enalapril, Lisinopril, and Rosmarinic acid. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed to shed light on the mechanism involved in the reaction.

         <title>On the Reactivity of Phosphaalumenes towards C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphaalumenes react with alkynes and alkenes. Depending on the steric profile of the alkyne either 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes in a formal [2 2] cycloaddition or zwitterionic 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes through threefold insertion into the Al&#8722;P bond are obtained. With alkenes 1,2&#8208;phosphalumates and 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes are obtained. Computational studies corroborate the contrasting pathways and underline the role of the aluminum center.







Abstract
Heterocycles containing group 13 and 15 elements such as borazines are an integral part of organic, biomedical and materials chemistry. Surprisingly, heterocycles containing P and Al are rare. We have now utilized phosphaalumenes in reactions with alkynes, alkenes and conjugated double bond systems. With sterically demanding alkynes 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes were afforded, whereas the reaction with HCCH or HCCSiMe3 gave 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes. Using styrene saturated 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumates were formed, which reacted further with additional styrene to give different regio&#8208;isomers of 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes. Using ethylene, a 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinane is obtained, while with 1,3&#8208;butadiene a bicyclic system containing an aluminacyclopentane and a phosphirane unit was synthesized.

     alt="On the Reactivity of Phosphaalumenes towards C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphaalumenes react with alkynes and alkenes. Depending on the steric profile of the alkyne either 1,2-phosphaalumetes in a formal [2 2] cycloaddition or zwitterionic 1,4-phosphaaluminabarrelenes through threefold insertion into the Al&#8722;P bond are obtained. With alkenes 1,2-phosphalumates and 1,4-aluminaphosphorinanes are obtained. Computational studies corroborate the contrasting pathways and underline the role of the aluminum center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterocycles containing group 13 and 15 elements such as borazines are an integral part of organic, biomedical and materials chemistry. Surprisingly, heterocycles containing P and Al are rare. We have now utilized phosphaalumenes in reactions with alkynes, alkenes and conjugated double bond systems. With sterically demanding alkynes 1,2-phosphaalumetes were afforded, whereas the reaction with HCCH or HCCSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gave 1,4-phosphaaluminabarrelenes. Using styrene saturated 1,2-phosphaalumates were formed, which reacted further with additional styrene to give different regio-isomers of 1,4-aluminaphosphorinanes. Using ethylene, a 1,4-aluminaphosphorinane is obtained, while with 1,3-butadiene a bicyclic system containing an aluminacyclopentane and a phosphirane unit was synthesized. The experimental work is supported by theoretical studies to shed light on the mechanism governing the formation of these heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse Reaction of Azide&#8208;Ynamides via &#945;&#8208;Imino Copper Carbenes</title>

A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse of azide&#8208;ynamides via &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbenes is disclosed, enabling the practical and divergent assembly of chiral [1,4]thiazino [3,2&#8208;b]indoles in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This protocol represents the first asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and the first asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.







Abstract
[2,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp3)&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.

         <title>Substantial Improvement of an Epimerase for the Synthesis of D&#8208;Allulose by Biosensor&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Microdroplet Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified D&#8208;allulose biosensor was combined with a microdroplet screening system to establish an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening strategy. Structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution were conducted to remodel the SfDAE active pocket and its lid region for enhanced catalytic performance for the synthesis of D&#8208;allulose. This approach shows great potential for the design and optimization of biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platforms.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of D&#8208;allulose has been achieved using ketose 3&#8208;epimerases (KEases), but its application is limited by poor catalytic performance. In this study, we redesigned a genetically encoded biosensor based on a D&#8208;allulose&#8208;responsive transcriptional regulator for real&#8208;time monitoring of D&#8208;allulose. An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput droplet&#8208;based microfluidic screening platform was further constructed by coupling with this D&#8208;allulose&#8208;detecting biosensor for the directed evolution of the KEases. Structural analysis of Sinorhizobium fredii D&#8208;allulose 3&#8208;epimerase (SfDAE) revealed that a highly flexible helix/loop region exposes or occludes the catalytic center as an essential lid conformation regulating substrate recognition. We reprogrammed SfDAE using structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution, in which a mutant M3&#8208;2 was identified with 17&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency. Our research offers a paradigm for the design and optimization of a biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platform.

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;assembly of Gold(I) Complexes by Multiple Kinetic Aggregation States with Nonlinear Optical and Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the preparation of AuI self&#8208;assembled structures by controlling the equilibrium among multiple kinetic traps. Multiple kinetic traps are important in influencing its supramolecular chirality transfer process. Moreover, the achiral and chiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies showed interesting photonic properties, including optical waveguides, strong emission polarization and non&#8208;linear optical functionalities.







Abstract
Introduction of multiple kinetic aggregation states (Aggs) into the self&#8208;assembly pathway could bring complexity and flexibility to the self&#8208;assemblies, which is difficult to realize due to the delicate equilibria established among different Aggs bonded by weak noncovalent interactions. Here, we describe a series of chiral and achiral d10 AuI bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, NHC) complexes, and the achiral complex could undergo self&#8208;assembly with multiple kinetic Aggs. Generation of multiple kinetic Aggs was realized by applying chiral or achiral seeds exhibiting large differences in elongation temperatures for their respective cooperative self&#8208;assembly processes. We further showed that the chiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies having non&#8208;centrosymmetric packing forms exhibit nonlinear optical response of second harmonic generation (SHG), while the SHG signal is absent in the achiral analogue. The crystalline achiral AuI self&#8208;assemblies could function as optical waveguides with strong emission polarization.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yields in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Antimony (III) Chlorides with the [SbCl5] Geometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five pairs of antimony chlorides have been synthesized via two synthetic conditions to produce distinctively different structures and PL properties. The A2SbCl5 types with square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry and near&#8208;unity PLQY can be synthesized via diffusion method in DMF. Alternatively, when growing via solution method in HCl, the non&#8208;emissive A2Sb2Cl8 types with seesaw dimmer geometry are obtained.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic antimony halides have attracted increasing attention due to the non&#8208;toxicity, stability, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). To shed light on the structural factors that contribute to the high PLQY, five pairs of antimony halides with general formula A2SbCl5 and A2Sb2Cl8 are synthesized via two distinct methods and characterized. The A2SbCl5 type adopts square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry with near&#8208;unity PLQY, while the A2Sb2Cl8 adopts seesaw dimmer [Sb2Cl8] geometry with PLQY&#8776;0&#8201;%. Through combined data analysis with the literature, we have found that A2SbCl5 series with square pyramidal geometry generally has much longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distances, leading to more expressed lone pairs of SbIII. Additional factors including Sb&#8722;Cl distance and stability of antimony chlorides may also affect PLQY. Our targeted synthesis and correlated insights provide efficient tools to precisely form highly emissive materials for optoelectronic applications.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; series with square pyramidal geometry generally has much longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distances, leading to more expressed lone pairs of Sb&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;. Additional factors including Sb&#8722;Cl distance and stability of antimony chlorides may also affect PLQY. Our targeted synthesis and correlated insights provide efficient tools to precisely form highly emissive materials for optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of Sulfur Dioxide to Sulfur Monoxide by Ferrous Porphyrin
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
SO2 could be reduced to SO by an iron porphyrin via a [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ intermediate. This intermediate, which is proposed to be involved in sulfite reductase enzymes, has not been observed outside the protein matrix previously and was characterized by EPR, Mossbauer and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The SO formed could be transferred to an organic diene through a cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
The reduction of SO2 to fixed forms of sulfur can address the growing concerns regarding its detrimental effect on health and the environment as well as enable its valorization into valuable chemicals. The naturally occurring heme enzyme sulfite reductase (SiR) is known to reduce SO2 to H2S and is an integral part of the global sulfur cycle. However, its action has not yet been mimicked in artificial systems outside of the protein matrix even after several decades of structural elucidation of the enzyme. While the coordination of SO2 to transition metals is documented, its reduction using molecular catalysts has remained elusive. Herein reduction of SO2 by iron(II) tetraphenylporphyrin is demonstrated. A combination of spectroscopic data backed up by theoretical calculations indicate that FeIITPP reduces SO2 by 2e&#8722;/2H+ to form an intermediate [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ species, also proposed for SiR, which releases SO. The SO obtained from the chemical reduction of SO2 could be evidenced in the form of a cheletropic adduct of butadiene resulting in an organic sulfoxide.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Strengthened Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Degradable X&#8208;ray Detector with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility and Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>

This work first designed and synthesized metal&#8208;free MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O perovskites by introducing bulk methyl groups to improve tolerance factor and enhance hydrogen bonds for improving its stability and performance. Importantly, the related flexible X&#8208;ray detector shows the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and promises to realize non&#8208;toxic degradation, mechanical bending stability and array imaging for future application.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) with flexible and degradable properties have been adopted in flexible X&#8208;ray detection. For now, figuring out the key factors between structure and device performance are critical to guide the design of MFPs. Herein, MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O was first designed and synthesized with improved structural stability and device performance. Through theoretical calculations, the introducing methyl group benefits modulating tolerance factor, increases dipole moment and strengthens hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, H2O increases the hydrogen bond formation sites and synergistically realizes the band nature modulation, ionic migration inhibition and structural stiffness optimization. Spectra analysis also proves that the improved electron&#8208;phonon coupling and carrier recombination lifetime contribute to enhanced performance. Finally, a flexible and degradable X&#8208;ray detector was fabricated with the highest sensitivity of 740.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit (0.14&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1).

         <title>Passivating Lithiated Graphite via Targeted Repair of SEI to Inhibit Exothermic Reactions in Early&#8208;Stage of Thermal Runaway for Safer Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclotrisiloxane (D3F) is triggered by LiCx to undergo ring&#8208;opening polymerization at elevated temperature (&gt;80&#8201;&#176;C), so as to targeted repair of cracked SEI. Consequently, the exothermic reaction of LiCx/electrolyte in early stage of thermal runaway is tamed by introducing D3F into routine carbonate electrolyte. Thus, the self&#8208;exothermic and TR&#8208;trigger temperatures of pouch cell with D3F are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#8201;&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The self&#8208;exothermic in early stage of thermal runaway (TR) is blasting&#8208;fuse for Li&#8208;ion battery safety issues. The exothermic reaction between lithiated graphite (LiCx) and electrolyte accounts for onset of this behavior. However, preventing the deleterious reaction still encounters hurdles. Here, we manage to inhibit this reaction by passivating LiCx in real time via targeted repair of SEI. It is shown that 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tris(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)cyclotrisiloxane (D3F) can be triggered by LiCx to undergo ring&#8208;opening polymerization at elevated temperature, so as to targeted repair of fractured SEI. Due to the high thermal stability of polymerized D3F, exothermic reaction between LiCx and electrolyte is inhibited. As a result, the self&#8208;exothermic and TR trigger temperatures of pouch cell are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#8201;&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#8201;&#176;C. This work opens up a new avenue for designing functional additives to block initial exothermal reaction and inhibit TR in early stage.

         <title>Twisting of Porphyrin by Assembly in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework yielding Chiral Photoconducting Films for Circularly&#8208;Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating functionalized porphyrin in a crystalline lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework thin film, the porphyrin core twists and becomes chiral. The chiral porphyrin thin film shows excellent optoelectronic properties with different photocurrents for right&#8208; and left&#8208;circularly polarized light.







Abstract
While materials based on organic molecules usually have either superior optoelectronic or superior chiral properties, the combination of both is scarce. Here, a crystalline chiroptical film based on porphyrin with homochiral side groups is presented. While the dissolved molecule has a planar, thus, achiral porphyrin core, upon assembly in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film, the porphyrin core is twisted and chiral. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the MOF film also results in excellent optoelectronic properties. By exciting the Soret band of porphyrin, efficient photoconduction with a high On&#8208;Off&#8208;ratio is realized. More important, handedness&#8208;dependent circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light photoconduction with a dissymmetry factor g of 4.3&#215;10&#8722;4 is obtained. We foresee the combination of such assembly&#8208;induced chirality with the rich porphyrin chemistry will enable a plethora of organic materials with exceptional chiral and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>High Electron Mobility Hot&#8208;Exciton Induced Delayed Fluorescent Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the new conjugated units, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs) were designed and synthesized. By fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good optoelectronic integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and especially the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence was obtained.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is of great significance for the fabrication of miniaturized optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting transistors. However, great challenge exists in designing key materials, especially those who integrates triplet exciton utilization ability. Herein, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs), with 2,6&#8208;extended anthracene donor, and 3&#8242;&#8208; or 4&#8242;&#8208;substituted naphthalene monoimide acceptors were designed and synthesized. By introducing acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor structure, both materials show high electron mobility. Moreover, by fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence were obtained in 4&#8242;&#8208;DNADI. This work opens a new avenue for developing high electron mobility emissive organic semiconductors with efficient utilization of triplet excitons.

         <title>A Visible Light Driven Nickel Carbonylation Catalyst: The Synthesis of Acid Chlorides from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst has been develop. This offers a method for carbonylative coupling reactions with an earth abundant metal at ambient temperature for the conversion of alkyl halides into synthetically versatile acid chlorides. The acid chlorides can then be transformed into an array of challenging ester, thioester and amide products.







Abstract
We describe here the development of a visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst. The combination of the large bite&#8208;angle Xantphos ligand with nickel(0) generates a catalyst capable of activating alkyl halides toward carbonylation at ambient temperature in the presence of blue light irradiation, and the reductive elimination of high energy acid chloride products. Unlike classical carbonylations, where the coordination of carbon monoxide inhibits the reactivity of earth abundant nickel catalysts, a CO&#8208;associated nickel is found to be the active catalyst in the reaction. Coupling the build&#8208;up of acid chlorides with nucleophile addition can be used to access various amides, esters and thioesters, including those of sterically encumbered substrates or with metal&#8208;reactive functionalities.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Taxol Enabled by Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Radical Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol, an anticancer drug, possesses an unusually oxygenated and intricately fused 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) structure. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of taxol. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions allowed for connection of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings and cyclization of the B&#8208;ring, respectively. The ABC&#8208;ring was then converted to the target by newly devised functional and protective group manipulations.







Abstract
Taxol is a clinically used drug for the treatment of various types of cancers. Its 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) system is substituted by eight oxygen functional groups and flanked by four acyl groups, including a &#946;&#8208;amino acid side chain. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of this unusually oxygenated and intricately fused structure. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions connected the A&#8208; and C&#8208;ring fragments and cyclized the B&#8208;ring, respectively. Functional groups of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings were then efficiently decorated by employing newly developed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective reactions. Finally, construction of the D&#8208;ring and conjugation with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid delivered taxol. The powerful coupling reactions and functional group manipulations implemented in the present synthesis provide new valuable information for designing multistep target&#8208;oriented syntheses of diverse bioactive natural products.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Adduct of Atomic P(&#8722;1) as a Source of Phosphinidenes (PR), Diphosphorus (P2), and Indium Phosphide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelation approach was employed to access low&#8208;valent phosphorus centers. The resulting adducts act as P atom sources for phosphinidene (PR) transfer, indium phosphide synthesis, and neutral P2 transfer to organic substrates.







Abstract
We report phosphinidenes (PR) stabilized by an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelate. These adducts include the parent phosphinidene, PH, which is accessed via thermolysis of coordinated HPCO. The reported FLP&#8208;PH species acts as a springboard to other phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds, such as FLP&#8208;adducts of diphosphorus (P2) and InP3. Our new adducts participate in thermal&#8208; or light&#8208;induced phosphinidene elimination (of both PH and PR, R=organic group), transfer P2 units to an organic substrate, and yield the useful semiconductor InP at only 110&#8201;&#176;C from solution.

         <title>Superconductivity in an Orbital&#8208;Reoriented SnAs Square Lattice: A Case Study of Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of structure unit SnAs4 is realized via a topotactic phase transformation under high pressure, which leads to a record&#8208;high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 7.5&#8197;K among all the synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. It is the synergistic effect of orbital reorientation and charge redistribution from the pz to the px+py orbitals that facilitates the electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosts the superconductivity.







Abstract
Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs&#8208;based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure, resulting in a record&#8208;high Tc among all synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane pz orbital to the in&#8208;plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p&#8208;orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconducting systems.

&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) of 7.5&#8197;K among all the synthesized SnAs-based compounds. It is the synergistic effect of orbital reorientation and charge redistribution from the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals that facilitates the electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosts the superconductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structural units in SnAs-based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to square SnAs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under pressure, resulting in a record-high &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; among all synthesized SnAs-based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out-of-plane &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital to the in-plane &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconducting systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing Textured Zinc Metal Anodes through Regulating Electrodeposition Current for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (002) plane textured Zn metal is realized by using a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy in a low&#8208;cost Zn (CH3COO)2 aqueous electrolyte. Increasing the current density not only accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei but also boosts the growth rate of (100) crystal plane, thus enabling the final exposure of (002) surface for Zn electrodeposits.







Abstract
Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as&#8208;deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes.

         <title>Smart Nanosensitizers for Activatable Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Tumors by Redox&#8208;Controlled Disassembly</title>

Tumor&#8208;targeted and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers (1&#8208;NPs) are fabricated via co&#8208;assembly and disassembly processes, which confer burst release of small molecules 2&#8208;Gd, Zn&#8208;PPA&#8208;SH and NLG919 within tumor cells, enabling fluorescence and magnetic resonance bimodal imaging&#8208;guided sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors and deep&#8208;seated GL261 gliomas in mice upon irradiation with combined ultrasound (US) and 671&#8208;nm laser (hv).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted and stimuli&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers are highly desirable for cancer theranostics. However, designing smart nanosensitizers with multiple imaging signals and synergistic therapeutic activities switched on is challenging. Herein, we report tumor&#8208;targeted and redox&#8208;activatable nanosensitizers (1&#8208;NPs) for sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of tumors by molecular co&#8208;assembly and redox&#8208;controlled disassembly. 1&#8208;NPs show a high longitudinal relaxivity (r1=18.7&#177;0.3&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), but &#8220;off&#8221; dual fluorescence (FL) emission (at 547 and 672&#8197;nm), &#8220;off&#8221; sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibition activities. Upon reduction by glutathione (GSH), 1&#8208;NPs rapidly disassemble and remotely release small molecules 2&#8208;Gd, Zn&#8208;PPA&#8208;SH and NLG919, concurrently switching on (1)&#8197;dual FL emission, (2)&#8197;sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy and (3)&#8197;IDO1 inhibition activities. After systemic injection, 1&#8208;NPs are effective for bimodal FL and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging&#8208;guided sono&#8208;photodynamic immunotherapy of orthotropic breast and brain tumors in mice under combined ultrasound (US) and 671&#8208;nm laser irradiation.

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties of a Biologically Relevant [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2] Diamond Core Motif with a Short Iron&#8208;Iron Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;closed&#8208;core&#8221; FeIII2 (&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex containing diminished Fe coordination and short Fe&#8722;Fe separation is shown to reproduce the large pre&#8208;edge intensity typically associated with the &#8220;open&#8208;core&#8221; structure in intermediate Q of soluble methane monooxygenase. This finding may broaden the scope of structural models considered for high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.







Abstract
Diiron cofactors in enzymes perform diverse challenging transformations. The structures of high valent intermediates (Q in methane monooxygenase and X in ribonucleotide reductase) are debated since Fe&#8722;Fe distances of 2.5&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#197; were attributed to &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;closed&#8221; cores with bridging or terminal oxido groups. We report the crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of a FeIII2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex (2) with tetrahedral (4C) centres and short Fe&#8722;Fe distance (2.52&#8197;&#197;), persisting in organic solutions. 2 shows a large Fe K&#8208;pre&#8208;edge intensity, which is caused by the pronounced asymmetry at the TD FeIII centres due to the short Fe&#8722;&#956;&#8722;O bonds. A &#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197; Fe&#8722;Fe distance is unlikely for six&#8208;coordinate sites in Q or X, but for a Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 core containing four&#8208;coordinate (or by possible extension five&#8208;coordinate) iron centres there may be enough flexibility to accommodate a particularly short Fe&#8722;Fe separation with intense pre&#8208;edge transition. This finding may broaden the scope of models considered for the structure of high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.

         <title>Facilitated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aerobic Environment on a Copper&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
After aerobic pretreatment, the MOF node of the hybrid catalyst was hydroxylated and exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4. Intriguingly, the addition of 20&#8201;% O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; rather, a fivefold increase was found when compared to the lack of O2.







Abstract
Herein, we fabricated a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking hybrid photocatalyst by combining two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: g&#8208;C3N4 and a Cu&#8208;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). After an aerobic photocatalytic pretreatment, this hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4 under the typical level (20&#8201;%) of O2 in the air. Intriguingly, the presence of O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; instead, a fivefold increase compared with that in the absence of O2 was observed. Structural analysis indicated that during aerobic pretreatment, the Cu node in the 2D&#8208;MOF moiety was hydroxylated by the hydroxyl generated from the reduction of O2. Then the formed hydroxylated Cu node maintained its structure during aerobic CO2 reduction, whereas it underwent structural alteration and was reductively devitalized in the absence of O2. Theoretical calculations further demonstrated that CO2 reduction, instead of O2 reduction, occurred preferentially on the hydroxylated Cu node.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Evoke Pyroptosis for High&#8208;Efficiency Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic therapeutic effect and immunogenicity of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoparticles were studied. The nanoparticles can intrinsically induce pyroptosis accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death to further activate antitumor immunity and reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thus realizing high&#8208;efficiency immunotherapy and tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
Although zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been applied in various tumor therapies, the intrinsic immunogenicity remains unclear. Here, we initiatively discover that ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (NPs) can intrinsically induce pyroptosis by a caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;dependent pathway. The pyroptotic cell death is accompanied by necrosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD) simultaneously for efficient in situ immunity initiation. Meanwhile, carbonyl cyanide m&#8208;chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial depolarizing agent, is successfully loaded into ZIF&#8208;8 NPs and found to further enhance the pyroptosis process. Collectively, the obtained Pluronic F127&#8208;modified CCCP&#8208;incorporated ZIF&#8208;8 NPs (F127ZIF&#8208;8CCCP NPs) activate antitumor immunity and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), realizing high&#8208;efficiency tumor growth inhibition. This work will facilitate biomedicine applications of ZIF&#8208;8 and provide good inspiration for pyroptosis&#8208;induced cancer therapy.

         <title>Optimized Sieving Effect for Ethanol/Water Separation by Ultramicroporous MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent ethanol/water separation has been achieved using two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) owing to molecular sieving effect. The slightly larger rhombohedral channels in Co&#8208;squarate provide a further optimization of sieving effect by enhancing the guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. A benchmarking water adsorption capacity at ultralow pressure is obtained in Co&#8208;squarate.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity ethanol is a promising renewable energy resource, however separating ethanol from trace amount of water is extremely challenging. Herein, two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) were used as adsorbents. A prominent water adsorption and a negligible ethanol adsorption identify perfect sieving effect on both MOFs. Co&#8208;squarate exhibits a surprising water adsorption capacity at low pressure that surpassing the reported MOFs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations reveal that such prominent performance of Co&#8208;squarate derives from the optimized sieving effect through pore structure adjustment. Co&#8208;squarate with larger rhombohedral channel is suitable for zigzag water location, resulting in reinforced guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. Ultrapure ethanol (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained directly by ethanol/water mixed vapor breaking through the columns packed with Co&#8208;squarate, contributing to a potential for fuel&#8208;grade ethanol purification.

         <title>Emergence of Visible&#8208;Light Water Oxidation Upon Hexaniobate&#8208;Ligand Entrapment of Quantum&#8208;Confined Copper&#8208;Oxide Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of sensitizer&#8208;free visible&#8208;light water oxidation by CuO was achieved using water&#8208;soluble hexaniobate cluster anions to entrap quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals of the familiar earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide.







Abstract
The formation of small 1 to 3&#8197;nm organic&#8208;ligand free metal&#8208;oxide nanocrystals (NCs) is essential to utilization of their attractive size&#8208;dependent properties in electronic devices and catalysis. We now report that hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anions, [Nb6O19]8&#8722;, can arrest the growth of metal&#8208;oxide NCs and stabilize them as water&#8208;soluble complexes. This is exemplified by formation of hexaniobate&#8208;complexed 2.4&#8208;nm monoclinic&#8208;phase CuO NCs (1), whose ca. 350 Cu&#8208;atom cores feature quantum&#8208;confinement effects that impart an unprecedented ability to catalyze visible&#8208;light water oxidation with no added photosensitizers or applied potentials, and at rates exceeding those of hematite NCs. The findings point to polyoxoniobate&#8208;ligand entrapment as a potentially general method for harnessing the size&#8208;dependent properties of very small semiconductor NCs as the cores of versatile, entirely&#8208;inorganic complexes.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization: A Convenient Strategy to Realize Efficient BT.2020 Blue Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance emitter using intramolecular cyclization endows BT.2020&#8208;compliant deep blue emission with an ultranarrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.153, 0.042) in toluene, thus achieving a high external quantum efficiency of 25.6&#8201;% in a hyper&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Rationally tuning the emission position and narrowing the full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of an emitter is of great importance for many applications. By synergistically improving rigidity, strengthening the resonant strength, inhibiting molecular bending and rocking, and destabilizing the HOMO energy level, a deep&#8208;blue emitter (CZ2CO) with a peak wavelength of 440&#8197;nm and an ultranarrow spectral FWHM of 16&#8197;nm (0.10&#8197;eV) was developed via intramolecular cyclization in a carbonyl/N resonant core (QAO). The dominant &#965;0&#8208;0 transition character of CZ2CO gives a Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates (CIE) of (0.144, 0.042), nicely complying with the BT.2020 standard. Moreover, a hyper&#8208;fluorescent device based on CZ2CO shows a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 25.6&#8201;% and maintains an EQE of 22.4&#8201;% at a practical brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Low Coordination State RhI&#8208;Complex as High Performance Catalyst for Asymmetric Intramolecular Cyclopropanation: Construction of penta&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, broad&#8208;scope rhodium (I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed that allows otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access penta&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes to be prepared in a highly enantioselective manner through asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of rather challenging tri&#8208;substituted allylic diazoacetates. Extraordinary high performance of RhI/diene complex is showcased with low catalyst loading as little as 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
A simple, broad&#8208;scope rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system for challenging asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of various tri&#8208;substituted allylic diazoacetates was successfully developed. The low coordination state RhI&#8208;complex exhibits an extraordinarily high degree of tolerance to the variation in the extent of substitution of the allyl double bond, thus allowing the efficient construction of a wide range of penta&#8208;substituted, fused&#8208;ring cyclopropanes bearing three contiguous stereogenic centers, including two quaternary carbon stereocenters, in a highly enantioselective manner with ease at catalyst loading as low as 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%. The stereoinduction mode of this RhI&#8208;carbene&#8208;directed asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation was investigated by DFT calculations, indicating that &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of chiral diene ligand and diazo substrate play a key role in the control of the reaction enantioselectivity.

         <title>Low Concentration Sulfolane&#8208;Based Electrolyte for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a low concentration electrolyte (LCE) (0.25&#8197;M) with low solubility LiNO3 as the main salt. This LCE shows good separator wettability, high ionic conductivity, high Li+ transference number, and low cost. The rational design of the interphases enables LCE to be suitable for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, lithium metal is stabilized in the highly reactive sulfolane&#8208;based electrolyte under low concentration (0.25&#8197;M) for the first time. Inorganic&#8208;polymer hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high ionic conductivity, low bonding with lithium and high flexibility enables dense chunky lithium deposition and high plating/stripping efficiency. Low concentration electrolyte (LCE) also enables excellent cycling stability of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)/Li cells at 1&#8197;C (90.7&#8201;% retention after 500&#8197;cycles) and 0.3&#8197;C (83.3&#8201;% retention after 1000&#8197;cycles). With a low N/P ratio (&#8776;2), the capacity retention for NCM523/Li cells can achieve 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C. Exploring the LCE is of paramount significance because it provides more possibilities of the lithium salt selections, especially reviving some lithium salts that are excluded before due to their low solubility. More importantly, LCE has the significant advantage of commercialization due to its cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Synchronous Dual Electrolyte Additive Sustains Zn Metal Anode with 5600&#8197;h Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchronous dual electrolyte additive sustains reversible Zn metal anode: A dual electrolyte additive strategy is developed via the direct addition of xylitol and graphene oxide species into common zinc sulfate electrolyte. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be readily obtained under the synergistic additive regulation, thus enabling a dense and uniform deposition with a lifespan of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Despite conspicuous merits of Zn metal anodes, the commercialization is still handicapped by rampant dendrite formation and notorious side reaction. Manipulating the nucleation mode and deposition orientation of Zn is a key to rendering stabilized Zn anodes. Here, a dual electrolyte additive strategy is put forward via the direct cooperation of xylitol (XY) and graphene oxide (GO) species into typical zinc sulfate electrolyte. As verified by molecular dynamics simulations, the incorporated XY molecules could regulate the solvation structure of Zn2+, thus inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. The self&#8208;assembled GO layer is in favor of facilitating the desolvation process to accelerate reaction kinetics. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be realized under the synergistic modulation, enabling a dense and uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetric cell based on dual additives harvests a highly reversible cycling of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Ultramicroporous Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with Functionality Pair for Membrane C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with ultramicroporous structure and paired functionalities is designed and synthesized. This COF is exfoliated into large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets, enabling the fabrication of compatible hybrid membranes. The COF membranes exhibit superior acetylene/ethylene separation with high selectivity and large permeability owing to collaborative acetylene recognition and gas&#8208;transport highways.







Abstract
Gas separation efficiency of covalent organic framework (COF) membrane can be greatly elevated through precise functionalization. A pair&#8208;functionalized COF membrane of 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and isoquinoline&#8208;5,8&#8208;diamine (IQD) monomers in two and three nodes is designed and synthesized. TP&#8208;IQD is crystallized in a two&#8208;dimensional structure with a pore size of 6.5&#8197;&#197; and a surface area of 289&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. This COF possesses N&#8722;O paired groups which cooperatively interact with C2H2 instead of C2H4. TP&#8208;IQD nanosheets of &#8776;10&#8197;&#956;m in width and &#8776;4&#8197;nm in thickness are prepared by mechanical exfoliation; they are further processed with 6FDA&#8208;ODA polymer into a hybrid membrane. High porosity and functionality pair of TP&#8208;IQD offer the membrane with significantly increased C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity which are 160&#8201;% and 430&#8201;% higher of pure 6FDA&#8208;ODA. The boosted performance demonstrates high efficiency of the pair&#8208;functionality strategy for the synthesis of separation&#8208;led COFs.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Isomeric Naphthalene&#8208;Based 2D Kagome Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted synthesis of two isomeric naphthalene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with Kagome topology is realized by rational design of isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different length of substituents. The specific pore structures of the two isomeric frameworks result in a significant difference in spatial immobilization of C60 guests. Incorporation of C60 into m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF increases the photoconductivity of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, presumably due to the enhanced charge transfer effect.







Abstract
Targeted synthesis of kagome (kgm) topologic 2D covalent organic frameworks remains challenging, presumably due to the severe dependence on building units and synthetic conditions. Herein, two isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different lengths of substituted arms based on naphthalene core (p&#8208;Naph and m&#8208;Naph) are elaborately designed and utilized for the defined synthesis of isomeric kgm Naph&#8208;COFs. The two isomeric frameworks exhibit splendid crystallinity and showcase the same chemical composition and topologic structure with, however, different pore channels. Interestingly, C60 is able to uniformly be encapsulated into the triangle channels of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF via in situ incorporation method, while not the isomeric p&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, likely due to the different pore structures of the two isomeric COFs. The resulting stable C60@m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF composite exhibits much higher photoconductivity than the m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF owing to charge transfer between the conjugated skeletons and C60 guests.

         <title>Ligand Dilution Analysis Facilitates Aptamer Binding Characterization at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily implemented membrane&#8208;receptor&#8208;analysis method termed ligand dilution analysis, combining the concepts of single&#8208;molecule localization and random sampling, is reported. Aptamer binding characterization, including receptor density calculation, single&#8208;molecule colocalization, binding site determination, motion and fluctuation analysis, is performed with minimal probe and instrument requirements.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single&#8208;molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity. Therefore, we herein propose a random sampling&#8208;based analysis strategy termed ligand dilution analysis (LDA) for easily implemented aptamer&#8208;based receptor study. Receptor density on the cell surface can be calculated based on a regression model. By using a synergistic ligand dilution design, colocalization and differentiation of aptamer and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding on a single receptor can be realized. Once this is accomplished, precise binding site and detailed aptamer&#8208;receptor binding mode can be further determined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand dilution strategy also sets the stage for an aptamer&#8208;based dynamics analysis of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional motion and fluctuation of highly expressed receptors on the live cell membrane.

Herein, we report a synthesis of cyclohexanones bearing multi&#8208;continuous stereocenters by combining copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of dialkylzinc reagents to cyclic enones with iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction. Good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity can be obtained. The current reaction can achieve the stereodivergent construction of nonadjacent stereocenters.

         <title>De&#8208;Linker&#8208;Enabled Exceptional Volumetric Acetylene Storage Capacity and Benchmark C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Benchmark acetylene adsorbents come to existence via novel cluster&#8208;cluster&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks designed by a de&#8208;linker strategy and are capable of reaching the highest acetylene storage capacity, top&#8208;level IAST selectivity, benchmark breakthrough interval time, and extraordinary productivity for C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 mixtures.







Abstract
An ideal adsorbent for separation requires optimizing both storage capacity and selectivity, but maximizing both or achieving a desired balance remain challenging. Herein, a de&#8208;linker strategy is proposed to address this issue for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Broadly speaking, the de&#8208;linker idea targets a class of materials that may be viewed as being intermediate between zeolites and MOFs. Its feasibility is shown here by a series of ultra&#8208;microporous MOFs (SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;M, M=Mn, Co, Ni, Zn). SNNU&#8208;98 exhibit high volumetric C2H2 uptake capacity under low and ambient pressures (175.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 @ 0.1&#8197;bar, 222.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 @ 1&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), as well as extraordinary selectivity (2405.7 for C2H2/C2H4, 22.7 for C2H2/CO2). Remarkably, SNNU&#8208;98&#8208;Mn can efficiently separate C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with a benchmark C2H2/C2H4 (1/99) breakthrough time of 2325&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1, and produce 99.9999&#8201;% C2H4 with a productivity up to 64.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing values of reported MOF adsorbents.

Following the concept of &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; design, the asymmetric anion (MPSA&#8722;) with high donicity was synthesized and validated to boost the reversibility of potassium superoxide/peroxide redox without any electrocatalysts. Such anions could effectively retard the electrode passivation with enhanced discharge capacity and facilitate the K2O2 decomposition out of the substrate.







Abstract
A battery cathode based on the superoxide/peroxide redox not only inherits the advantage of oxygen (O2) batteries in high capacities and low costs but also overcomes the disadvantages in O2 storage, electrolyte evaporation, and anode deactivation due to O2 crossover. Herein, we report an enhanced potassium superoxide (KO2)/peroxide (K2O2) conversion by adopting a high&#8208;donicity anion additive in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Such an anion was synthesized via a &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; strategy and validated to enhance the electron donicity of the electrolyte. The use of high&#8208;donicity anion could lead to enhanced KO2 utilization (&#8776;90.2&#8201;%) by retarding electrode passivation and allow the full charging back of K2O2 through the solution&#8208;mediated pathway without electrocatalysts. No apparent cell degradation is observed during the first 120&#8197;cycles by controlling the reversible depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge capacity at 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1
 within an O2&#8208;free region. The K&#8722;KO2 cell delivers a high energy efficiency (&gt;84.4&#8201;%) and a lifespan of over 1440&#8197;hours.

         <title>Direct Deprotonative Functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethyl Ketones using a Catalytic Organosuperbase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deprotonation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones is underinvestigated due to the instability of the generated carbanion that can evolve into a fluorocarbene. A method for the deprotonative functionalization of these compounds is described herein under an organocatalytic system using various electrophiles, and is also applied to a related &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl sulfoxide. This strategy gives access to highly valuable difluoromethylene scaffolds.







Abstract
The deprotonative functionalization of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones is described herein. Using a catalytic organosuperbase and a silane additive, the corresponding difluoroenolate could be generated and trapped with aldehydes to deliver various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones in high yields. This new strategy tolerates numerous functional groups and represents the access to the difluoroenolate by direct deprotonation of the difluoromethyl unit. The diastereoselective version of the reaction was also investigated with d.r. up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7. Several transformations were performed to demonstrate the synthetic potential of these &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. In addition, this method has been extended to the use of other electrophiles such as imines and chalcogen derivatives, and a difluoromethyl sulfoxide as nucleophile, thus leading to a diversity of difluoromethylene compounds.

         <title>Designed Iron Catalysts for Allylic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Propylene and Simple Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl complex was discovered to enable the coupling of the allylic carbon of propylene and carbonyl electrophiles. This approach was also successfully applied to allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of simple olefins. Experimental and computational studies provided insights into the mechanism and origins of ligand effects on reactivity and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Propylene gas is produced worldwide by steam cracking on million&#8208;metric&#8208;ton scale per year. It serves as a valuable starting material for &#960;&#8208;bond functionalization but is rarely applied in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H functionalization for fine chemical synthesis. Herein, we report that a newly&#8208;developed cationic cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl complex allows for the conversion of propylene to its allylic C&#8722;C bond coupling products under catalytic conditions. This approach was also found applicable to the allylic functionalization of simple &#945;&#8208;olefins with distinctive branched selectivity. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies supported the allylic deprotonation of the metal&#8208;coordinated alkene as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and led to insights into the multifaceted roles of the newly designed ligand in promoting allylic C&#8722;H functionalization with enhanced reactivity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Incorporated Sn Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our work, a facile hydrolysis method was developed to synthesize halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalysts. The introduction and retention of halogen dopants were verified by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn and as a result promoted CO2RR to formate, while suppressing the competing CO2RR to CO and HER.







Abstract
Electrochemically reducing CO2 to valuable fuels or feedstocks is recognized as a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the crises of fossil fuel shortage and carbon emission. Sn&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to make formic acid/formate, which unfortunately still suffer from low activity, selectivity and stability. In this work, halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) was introduced into the Sn catalyst by a facile hydrolysis method. The presence of halogen was confirmed by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn in halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst as compared to unmodified Sn under cathodic potentials in CO2RR and therefore tuned the adsorption strength of the key intermediate (*OCHO) toward formate formation. As a result, the halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2RR to produce formate.

         <title>Correlating the Experimentally Determined CO Adsorption Enthalpy with the Electrochemical CO Reduction Performance on Cu Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectroscopic method was developed to measure the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces at electrochemical conditions. The adsorption enthalpy of CO on dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;VSHE was determined to be 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Measured CO adsorption enthalpies on two different Cu electrodes were correlated with their activities in the electrochemical reduction of CO.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been widely employed as a descriptor for effective catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR), however, it has yet to be determined experimentally at electrochemical interfaces due to the lack of suitable techniques. In this work, we developed a method to determine the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces with quantitative surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. On dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#8776;37.9&#177;13.4&#8197;J/(mol&#8201;K), and &#8776;&#8722;9.8&#177;4.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide&#8208;derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products. The method developed in this work will help establish the correlation between the CO binding energy and the CO(2)RR activity.

On dendritic Cu at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5&#177;0.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8776;37.9&#177;13.4&#8197;J/(mol&#8201;K), and &#8776;&#8722;9.8&#177;4.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide-derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products. The method developed in this work will help establish the correlation between the CO binding energy and the CO&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manganese(II)&#8208;Guided Separation in the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Regime for Precise Identification of In Vivo Size Dependence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>

We report a facile one&#8208;step in situ Mn2+&#8208;guided centrifugation strategy to synthesize large&#8208;scale ultrasmall AuNPs with the size gradient decrease precisely controlled at the sub&#8208;nanometer regime, and further demonstrate that the sub&#8208;nanometer size differences (approximately 0.5&#8197;nm) significantly alter the non&#8208;specific phagocytosis of AuNPs in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, elimination rate, and nanotoxicology.







Abstract
A precise understanding of nano&#8208;bio interactions in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime is necessary for advancements in nanomedicine. However, this is currently hindered by the control of the nanoparticle size in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. Herein, we report a facile in situ Mn2+&#8208;guided centrifugation strategy for the synthesis of large&#8208;scale ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a precisely controlled size gradient at the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. With the discovery that [Mn(OH)]+, especially metallic manganese (Mn0@[Mn(OH)]+) nanoparticles, could selectively interact with larger AuNPs through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding to form aggregates, we also realized the fast (&lt;1&#8197;h) synthesis of water&#8208;soluble atomically precise Au25 with high yields (&gt;56&#8201;%). We further demonstrated that sub&#8208;nanometer size differences (approximately 0.5&#8197;nm) significantly alter non&#8208;specific phagocytosis of AuNPs in the reticuloendothelial system macrophages, elimination rate, and nanotoxicology.

         <title>A Multifluorination Strategy Toward Wide Bandgap Polymers for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;deficient tetrafluoronaphthodithiophene (FNT) was created to construct a family of PFNT&#8208;F/Cl polymers for organic solar cells. The PFNT&#8208;F/Cl&#8208;based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53&#8201;% and 18.10&#8201;%, suggesting multifluorinated polymers are promising donor materials for non&#8208;fullerene OSCs.







Abstract
Creating new electron&#8208;deficient unit is highly demanded to develop high&#8208;performance polymer donors for non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we reported a multifluorinated unit 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluoronaphtho[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithio&#8208;phene (FNT) and its polymers PFNT&#8208;F and PFNT&#8208;Cl. The advantages of multifluorination: (1) it enables the polymers to exhibit low&#8208;lying HOMO (&#8776;&#8722;5.5&#8197;eV) and wide band gap (&#8776;2.0&#8197;eV); (2) the short interactions (F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H, F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F) endow the polymers with properties of high film crystallinity and efficient hole transport; (3) well miscibility with NFAs that leads to a more well&#8208;defined nanofibrous morphology and face&#8208;on orientation in the blend films. Therefore, the PFNT&#8208;F/Cl&#8201;:&#8201;N3 based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53&#8201;% and 18.10&#8201;%, which make them ranked the best donor materials in OSCs. This work offers new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance polymers by multifluorination strategy.

         <title>Development of a General and Selective Nanostructured Cobalt Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Benzofurans, Indoles and Benzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrolysis of Co&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid template on silica resulted in stable and reusable Co/Co3O4 core&#8211;shell nanostructured catalyst which allows for the selective hydrogenation of benzofurans as well as indoles and benzothiophenes.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of benzofurans in the presence of a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal catalyst is reported. The developed optimal catalytic material consists of cobalt&#8208;cobalt oxide core&#8211;shell nanoparticles supported on silica, which has been prepared by the immobilization and pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid complex on silica under argon at 800&#8201;&#176;C. This novel catalyst allows for the selective hydrogenation of simple and functionalized benzofurans to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans as well as related heterocycles. The versatility of the reported protocol is showcased by the reduction of selected drugs and deuteration of heterocycles. Further, the stability, recycling, and reusability of the Co&#8208;nanocatalyst are demonstrated.

Mixed&#8208;linker MOF system Mn2 [TTF]x [NiS4]1&#8722;x (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and sensing performances. The variation of linker ratios changed the electrical conductivity of MOFs and induced a switch of n&#8208;type/p&#8208;type semiconducting behaviors. By adjusting the ratio of the two linkers in MOFs, we realized the fabrication and optimization of volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors for different application scenarios.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), with diverse metal nodes and designable organic linkers, offer unique opportunities for the rational engineering of semiconducting properties. In this work, we report a mixed&#8208;linker conductive MOF system with both tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) moieties, which allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and semiconductive characteristics. By continuously increasing the molar ratio between tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene), the switching of the semiconducting behaviors from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type was observed along with an increase in electrical conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude (from 2.88&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 to 9.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1). Furthermore, mixed&#8208;linker MOFs were applied for the chemiresistive detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), where the sensing performance was modulated by the corresponding linker ratios, showing synergistic and nonlinear modulation effects.

         <title>Oral Anticancer Heterobimetallic PtIV&#8722;AuI Complexes Show High In Vivo Activity and Low Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>

Oral anticancer heterobimetallic PtIV&#8722;AuI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes with a dual mechanism of action show high potency with low toxicity in vivo. The conjugation of two metals results in an enhanced inhibitory effect towards thioredoxin reductase and facilitates the co&#8208;transport of the prodrug into the tumor before activation.







Abstract
AuI&#8208;carbene and PtIV&#8722;AuI&#8208;carbene prodrugs display low to sub&#8208;&#956;M activity against several cancer cell lines and overcome cisplatin (cisPt) resistance. Linking a cisPt&#8208;derived PtIV(phenylbutyrate) complex to a AuI&#8208;phenylimidazolylidene complex 2, yielded the most potent prodrug. While in vivo tests against Lewis Lung Carcinoma showed that the prodrug PtIV(phenylbutyrate)&#8208;AuI&#8208;carbene (7) and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;administration of cisPt: phenylbutyrate:2 efficiently inhibited tumor growth (&#8776;95&#8201;%), much better than 2 (75&#8201;%) or cisPt (84&#8201;%), 7 exhibited only 5&#8201;% body weight loss compared to 14&#8201;% for 2, 20&#8201;% for cisPt and &gt;30&#8201;% for the co&#8208;administration. 7 was much more efficient than 2 at inhibiting TrxR activity in the isolated enzyme, in cells and in the tumor, even though it was much less efficient than 2 at binding to selenocysteine peptides modeling the active site of TrxR. Organ distribution and laser&#8208;ablation (LA)&#8208;ICP&#8208;TOFMS imaging suggest that 7 arrives intact at the tumor and is activated there.

         <title>Allosteric Regulation of Aptamer Affinity through Mechano&#8208;Chemical Coupling
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a simple and effective strategy for reversibly fine&#8208;tuning aptamer affinity by an allosteric molecular clamp that perturbs aptamer folding through mechanical extension, forcing it into a state in which its binding competency is considerably reduced. Aptamer affinity is regulated by tuning the mechanical properties of the molecular clamp.







Abstract
The capacity to precisely modulate aptamer affinity is important for a wide variety of applications. However, most such engineering strategies entail laborious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing or require prior knowledge of an aptamer's structure and ligand&#8208;binding domain. We describe here a simple and generalizable strategy for allosteric modulation of aptamer affinity by employing a double&#8208;stranded molecular clamp that destabilizes aptamer secondary structure through mechanical tension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer and show that we can alter its affinity by as much as 65&#8208;fold. We also show that this modulation can be rendered reversible by introducing a restriction enzyme cleavage site into the molecular clamp domain and describe a design strategy for achieving even more finely&#8208;tuned affinity modulation. This strategy requires no prior knowledge of the aptamer's structure and binding mechanism and should thus be generalizable across aptamers.

         <title>Exited State Absorption Upconversion Induced by Structural Defects for Photocatalysis with a Breakthrough Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a kind of novel excited state absorption (ESA) mode g&#8208;C3Nx nanosheet up&#8208;conversion materials with structural defects N2C has been developed and the working mechanism was demonstrated in detail here (two photons way with the defect level in the band gap). The quantum yield of optimum sample is as high as 0.64&#8201;%, which was much higher than that of traditional ESA mode (&#8776;10&#8722;4).







Abstract
The nitrogen&#8208;deficient graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been prepared, a new excited state absorption (ESA) up&#8208;conversion mode is discovered, which is directly induced by structural defects, showing distinct chemical characteristics from those based on lanthanide ions and triplet states chromophores. The abundant N2C vacancies in g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets work as the crucial intermediate excitation states, which lead to g&#8208;C3N4 upconverted emitting at the wavelength of 436&#8197;nm excited by the light with the wavelength of 800&#8197;nm. This process is proven to proceed via a two&#8208;photon involved ESA mode with a breakthrough quantum efficiency of 0.64&#8201;%. Further, we combine N2C vacancies enriched g&#8208;C3N4 with In2S3 and CdS, and successfully achieved an infrared light driven photocatalytic reactions. These findings offered a new family of up&#8208;conversion materials; more semiconductors with various structural defects are potential complementary members.

         <title>Double Asymmetric Core Optimizes Crystal Packing to Enable Selenophene&#8208;based Acceptor with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomeric A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A type double asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were synthesized by a n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl regioisomeric strategy to optimize single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance. PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl achieved a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain tailoring is a promising method to optimize the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, asymmetric alkyl chain&#8208;based small molecular acceptors (SMAs) are still difficult to afford. Herein, we adopted a novel asymmetric n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl substitution strategy and synthesized two A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A double asymmetric isomeric SMAs with asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based central core for OSCs. Crystallographic analysis indicates that AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl forms a more compact and order intermolecular packing compared to AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl, which contributed to higher electron mobility in neat AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl film. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl blend film shows a better morphology with appropriate phase separation and distinct face&#8208;on orientation than PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl. The OSCs with PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl obtain a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl (17.52&#8201;%), which is the best efficiency for the selenium&#8208;incorporated SMAs in binary BHJ OSCs. Our findings elucidate that the promising double asymmetric strategy with isomeric alkyl chains precisely modulates the crystal packing and enhances the photovoltaic efficiency of selenophene&#8208;incorporated SMAs.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Ni/V2O3 Heterostructure Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach was developed to fabricate a low&#8208;cost Ni/V2O3 heterostructure catalyst, which can efficiently and stably catalyze the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Ni/V2O3 interface sites can optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable HOR performance.







Abstract
Alkaline fuel cells can permit the adoption of platinum group metal&#8208;free (PGM&#8208;free) catalysts and cheap bipolar plates, thus further lowering the cost. With the exploration of PGM&#8208;free hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts, nickel&#8208;based compounds have been considered as the most promising HOR catalysts in alkali. Here we report an interfacial engineering through the formation of nickel&#8208;vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) heterostructures to activate Ni for efficient HOR catalysis in alkali. The strong electron transfer from Ni to V2O3 could modulate the electronic structure of Ni sites. The optimal Ni/V2O3 catalyst exhibits a high intrinsic activity of 0.038&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni/V2O3 interface as the active sites can enable to optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable activity and durability.

         <title>Electron Spin Catalysis with Graphene Belts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene belts with high electron spin concentrations, which were synthesized by C (sp2)&#8722;C (sp2) radical coupling, act as aerobic spin catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine; the catalytic mechanism has been studied by electron spin resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Here, we report kinetic studies using electron spin resonance spectroscopy on spin catalysis reactions caused by using graphene belts which were synthesized by a radical coupling method. The results show that &#963;&#8208;type free radical species provide the dominant sites for catalytic activity through the spin&#8208;spin interaction, although there are some other influencing factors. The spin catalysis mechanism can be applied both in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and in organic synthesis. The graphene belt spin catalyst shows excellent performance with a high ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V and long&#8208;term stability with almost no loss of activity after 50&#8201;000 cycles in alkaline media. It also shows excellent performance in a benzylamine coupling with molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding imine at an average conversion of &#8776;97.7&#8201;% and an average yield of &#8776;97.9&#8201;%. This work opens up a new research direction for understanding aerobic processes in the field of spin catalysis.

         <title>Guanidine Additive Enabled Intermolecular ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde&#8208;Amine&#8208;Thiol Three&#8208;Component Reactions for Modular Constructions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reaction were realized through the use of a guanidine additive. This method enables the construction of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates in a modular fashion, and it is anticipated that it will open up new and diverse opportunities to access new conjugate structures for chemical biology, medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.







Abstract
Recently, ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) is experiencing a renascence for the modification of proteins and peptides through OPA&#8208;amine two&#8208;component reactions for bioconjugation and intramolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reactions for cyclization. Historically, small thiol molecules were used in large excess to allow for the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol reaction forming 1&#8208;thio&#8208;isoindole derivatives. In this study, we discovered that guanidine could serve as an effective additive to switch the intermolecular OPA&#8208;amine&#8208;thiol three&#8208;component reaction to a stoichiometric process and enable the modular construction of peptide&#8208;peptide, and peptide&#8208;drug conjugate structures. Thus, 12 model peptide&#8208;peptide conjugates have been synthesized from unprotected peptides featuring all proteinogenic residues. Besides, 6 peptide&#8208;drug conjugates have been prepared in one step, with excellent conversions and isolated yields. In addition, a conjugate product has been further functionalized by utilizing a premodified OPA derivative, demonstrating the versatility and flexibility of this reaction.

         <title>Revealing the Formation Mechanism and Optimizing the Synthesis Conditions of Layered Double Hydroxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a way to investigate the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on layered double hydroxide (LDH) formation. The results revealed the formation mechanism of LDHs and also guided the synthesis of a library of LDHs with desired attributes, in water at room temperature without using any additives.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), whose formation is strongly related to OH&#8722; concentration, have attracted significant interest in various fields. However, the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8722; concentration on LDHs&#8217; formation has not been fully explored due to the unsuitability of the existing synthesis methods for in situ characterization. Here, the deliberately designed combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a solution to the above problem. The obtained results revealed the formation mechanism and also guided us to synthesize a library of LDHs with the desired attributes in water at room temperature without using any additives. After evaluating their oxygen evolution reaction performance, we found that FeNi&#8208;LDH with a Fe/Ni ratio of 25/75 exhibits one of the best performances so far reported.

         <title>Accelerated Transfer and Spillover of Carbon Monoxide through Tandem Catalysis for Kinetics&#8208;boosted Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique *CO transfer and spillover strategy was developed by fabricating Ni single atom supported on pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon as a *CO donor for feeding Cu NPs with *CO, boosting the coverage of *CO on Cu NPs and subsequently improving the selectivity for CO2&#8208;C2H4 conversion.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been widely applied in electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to produce multicarbon (C2+) feedstocks (e.g., C2H4). However, the high energy barriers for CO2 activation on the Cu surface is a challenge for a high catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. Herein, we developed an in situ *CO generation and spillover strategy by engineering single Ni atoms on a pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon support with a sodalite (SOD) topology (Ni&#8208;SOD/NC) that acted as a donor to feed adjacent Cu nanoparticles (NPs) with *CO intermediate. As a result, a high C2H4 selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% and an industrial&#8208;level current density of 160&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of &#8722;0.72&#8197;V were achieved. Our studies revealed that the isolated NiN3 active sites with adjacent pyridinic N species facilitated the *CO desorption and the massive *CO intermediate released from Ni&#8208;SOD/NC then overflowed to Cu NPs surface to enrich the *CO coverage for improving the selectivity of CO2ER to C2H4.

&lt;p&gt;A unique *CO transfer and spillover strategy was developed by fabricating Ni single atom supported on pyridinic N-enriched carbon as a *CO donor for feeding Cu NPs with *CO, boosting the coverage of *CO on Cu NPs and subsequently improving the selectivity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cu-based catalysts have been widely applied in electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER) to produce multicarbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) feedstocks (e.g., C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). However, the high energy barriers for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation on the Cu surface is a challenge for a high catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. Herein, we developed an in situ *CO generation and spillover strategy by engineering single Ni atoms on a pyridinic N-enriched carbon support with a sodalite (SOD) topology (Ni-SOD/NC) that acted as a donor to feed adjacent Cu nanoparticles (NPs) with *CO intermediate. As a result, a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% and an industrial-level current density of 160&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low potential of &#8722;0.72&#8197;V were achieved. Our studies revealed that the isolated NiN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; active sites with adjacent pyridinic N species facilitated the *CO desorption and the massive *CO intermediate released from Ni-SOD/NC then overflowed to Cu NPs surface to enrich the *CO coverage for improving the selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetramine Aspect Ratio and Flexibility Determine Framework Symmetry for Zn8L6 Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric design rules for the assembly of metal&#8208;organic capsules were derived. The preferred diastereomeric configurations of Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubes, with T, Th, S6 and D3 symmetry, are shown to depend upon the aspect ratio and conformational flexibility of their constituent rectangular subunits. Computational methods allowed further design principles to be deciphered.







Abstract
We derive design principles for the assembly of rectangular tetramines into Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cubic coordination cages. Because of the rectangular, as opposed to square, geometry of the ligand panels, and the possibility of either &#916; or &#923; handedness of each metal center at the eight corners of the pseudo&#8208;cube, many different cage diastereomers are possible. Each of the six tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponents investigated in this work assembled with zinc(II) and 2&#8208;formylpyridine in acetonitrile into a single Zn8L6 pseudo&#8208;cube diastereomer, however. Each product corresponded to one of four diastereomeric configurations, with T, Th, S6 or D3 symmetry. The preferred diastereomer for a given tetra&#8208;aniline subcomponent was shown to be dependent on its aspect ratio and conformational flexibility. Analysis of computationally modeled individual faces or whole pseudo&#8208;cubes provided insight as to why the observed diastereomers were favored.

         <title>Fully Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 Complex: Strong Cu&#8208;Cu interaction and Fast Electron Self&#8208;Exchange Rate Despite Large Structural Changes
</title>

         <dc:description>
Dicopper complexes in the CuICuI and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 states have been synthesized and comprehensively characterized, revealing a high delocalization energy of the mixed&#8208;valent species comparable with the biological CuA site. Fast electron self&#8208;exchange is suggested to occur via a sequential ET pathway, involving an active conformational isomer of the flexible CuICuI species, pointing to a potential gating scenario for ET.







Abstract
A flexible macrocyclic ligand with two tridentate {CNC} compartments can host two Cu ions in reversibly interconvertible states, CuICuI (1) and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 (2). They were characterized by XRD and multiple spectroscopic methods, including EPR, UV/Vis absorption and MCD, in combination with TD&#8208;DFT and CASSCF calculations. 2 features a short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu distance (&#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197;; compared to &#8776;4.0&#8197;&#197; in 1) and a very high delocalization energy of 13&#8201;000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, comparable to the mixed&#8208;valent state of the biological CuA site. Electron self&#8208;exchange between 1 and 2 is rapid despite large structural reorganization, and is proposed to proceed via a sequential mechanism involving an active conformer of 1, viz. 1&#8242;; the latter has been characterized by XRD. Such electron transfer (ET) process is reminiscent of the conformationally gated ET proposed for biological systems. This redox couple is a unique pair of flexible dicopper complexes, achieving fast electron self&#8208;exchange closely related to the function of the CuA site.

         <title>Modulating Cation Migration and Deposition with Xylitol Additive and Oriented Reconstruction of Hydrogen Bonds for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrolyte engineering strategy based on the usage of a small amount of xylitol additive is first proposed, which inhibits the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening the electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and SO42&#8722; ions in the primary solvation shell through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Highly reversible plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes is one of the critical processes determining the performance of Zn&#8208;ion batteries, but it is severely impeded by the parasitic side reaction and dendrite growth. Herein, a novel electrolyte engineering strategy is first proposed based on the usage of 100&#8197;mM xylitol additive, which inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening electrostatic interaction through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. Concomitantly, xylitol molecules are preferentially adsorbed by Zn surface, which provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress the planar diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Zn2+ transference number and cycling lifespan of Zn&#8741;Zn cells have been significantly elevated, overwhelmingly larger than bare ZnSO4. The cell coupled with a NaV3O8 cathode still behaves much better than the additive&#8208;free device in terms of capacity retention.

         <title>A BiVO4 Photoanode with a VOx Layer Bearing Oxygen Vacancies Offers Improved Charge Transfer and Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium oxide with enriched oxygen vacancies (VOx) was developed as an efficient oxygen evolution cocatalyst for BiVO4 photoanodes. The optimized BiVO4/VOx photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.29&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5&#8197;G illumination, and a high charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of 96&#8201;% is attained. Stable PEC water splitting is achieved for 40&#8197;h.







Abstract
Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics are one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. To address this issue, we report a vanadium oxide (VOx) with enriched oxygen vacancies conformally grown on BiVO4 photoanodes by a simple photo&#8208;assisted electrodeposition process. The optimized BiVO4/VOx photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 6.29&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5&#8197;G illumination, which is ca. 385&#8201;% as high as that of its pristine counterpart. A high charge&#8208;transfer efficiency of 96&#8201;% is achieved and stable PEC water splitting is realized, with a photocurrent retention rate of 88.3&#8201;% upon 40&#8197;h of testing. The excellent PEC performance is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in VOx that forms undercoordinated sites, which strengthen the adsorption of water molecules onto the active sites and promote charge transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This work demonstrates the potential of vanadium&#8208;based catalysts for PEC water oxidation.

The optimized BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/VO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.29&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5&#8197;G illumination, and a high charge-transfer efficiency of 96&#8201;% is attained. Stable PEC water splitting is achieved for 40&#8197;h.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics are one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. To address this issue, we report a vanadium oxide (VO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) with enriched oxygen vacancies conformally grown on BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanodes by a simple photo-assisted electrodeposition process. The optimized BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/VO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 6.29&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5&#8197;G illumination, which is ca. 385&#8201;% as high as that of its pristine counterpart. A high charge-transfer efficiency of 96&#8201;% is achieved and stable PEC water splitting is realized, with a photocurrent retention rate of 88.3&#8201;% upon 40&#8197;h of testing. The excellent PEC performance is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in VO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; that forms undercoordinated sites, which strengthen the adsorption of water molecules onto the active sites and promote charge transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This work demonstrates the potential of vanadium-based catalysts for PEC water oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Energy Storage Devices: Novel Benzothiadiazole Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Olefin&#8208;Linked COFs</title>

We report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COFs exhibit an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We shed light onto the charge&#8208;storage mechanism through the benzothiadiazole units in the COFs electrodes via computational and experimental analyses.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials for energy storage applications exhibiting enhanced electrochemical performance. While most of the reported organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries use carbonyl groups as electrochemically&#8208;active sites, their high hydrophilicity in aqueous electrolytes represents a critical drawback. Herein, we report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT synthesized via the aldol condensation between 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TMT) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)dibenzaldehyde (BT), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT exhibits an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the charge&#8208;storage mechanism in COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT electrodes is based on the supramolecularly engineered and reversible Zn2+ coordination by the benzothiadiazole units.

         <title>Generation of FeIV=O and its Contribution to Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions on a Single&#8208;Atom Iron&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron atoms with a Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance of 4&#8197;&#197; are the real active sites for generating FeIV=O in Fenton&#8208;like reactions, forming a complex through dual&#8208;site adsorption of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as the key step. The versatile FeIV=O species promotes the overall oxidizing capacity, pH tolerance, and stability of a Fenton&#8208;like system for water treatment.







Abstract
Generating FeIV=O on single&#8208;atom catalysts by Fenton&#8208;like reaction has been established for water treatment; however, the FeIV=O generation pathway and oxidation behavior remain obscure. Employing an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with a typical Fe&#8722;N4 moiety to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS), we demonstrate that generating FeIV=O is mediated by an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;PMS* complex&#8212;a well&#8208;recognized nonradical species for induction of electron&#8208;transfer oxidation&#8212;and we determined that adjacent Fe sites with a specific Fe1&#8722;Fe1 distance are required. After the Fe atoms with an Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance &lt;4&#8197;&#197; are PMS&#8208;saturated, Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;PMS* formed on Fe sites with an Fe1&#8208;Fe1 distance of 4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197; can coordinate with the adjacent FeII&#8722;N4, forming an inter&#8208;complex with enhanced charge transfer to produce FeIV=O. FeIV=O enables the Fenton&#8208;like system to efficiently oxidize various pollutants in a substrate&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;tolerant, and sustainable manner, where its prominent contribution manifests for pollutants with higher one&#8208;electron oxidation potential.

         <title>Promoting Surface Electric Conductivity for High&#8208;Rate LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to design the high&#8208;rate cathode materials is proposed and validated through tuning the surface electron transport. By constructing a highly conductive surface on LiCoO2 (LCO) particles, the effective voltage (Veff) was improved, thus driving more Li+ extraction/insertion under the same external voltage (Vo), and making LCO exhibit a superior rate performance as well as the excellent cycling stability at high rates.







Abstract
The cathode materials work as the host framework for both Li+ diffusion and electron transport in Li&#8208;ion batteries. The Li+ diffusion property is always the research focus, while the electron transport property is less studied. Herein, we propose a unique strategy to elevate the rate performance through promoting the surface electric conductivity. Specifically, a disordered rock&#8208;salt phase was coherently constructed at the surface of LiCoO2, promoting the surface electric conductivity by over one magnitude. It increased the effective voltage (Veff) imposed in the bulk, thus driving more Li+ extraction/insertion and making LiCoO2 exhibit superior rate capability (154&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C), and excellent cycling performance (93&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 10&#8197;C). The universality of this strategy was confirmed by another surface design and a simulation. Our findings provide a new angle for developing high&#8208;rate cathode materials by tuning the surface electron transport property.

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption of Epoxy&#8208;Functional Nanoparticles onto Stainless Steel Significantly Reduces Friction in Tribological Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of epoxy groups into sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles leads to their efficient chemical adsorption onto stainless steel whereas the corresponding non&#8208;functional nanoparticles merely undergo physical adsorption. Significantly greater adsorption occurs when the epoxy groups are placed within the steric stabilizer chains, which leads to enhanced lubrication in tribology studies.







Abstract
Epoxy&#8208;functional sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (ca. 27&#8197;nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil.

     alt="Enhanced Adsorption of Epoxy-Functional Nanoparticles onto Stainless Steel Significantly Reduces Friction in Tribological Studies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction of epoxy groups into sterically-stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles leads to their efficient chemical adsorption onto stainless steel whereas the corresponding non-functional nanoparticles merely undergo physical adsorption. Significantly greater adsorption occurs when the epoxy groups are placed within the steric stabilizer chains, which leads to enhanced lubrication in tribology studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epoxy-functional sterically-stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (ca. 27&#8197;nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil. Nanoparticle adsorption onto stainless steel is examined using a quartz crystal microbalance. Incorporating epoxy groups within the steric stabilizer chains results in a two-fold increase in the adsorbed amount, &#915;, at 20&#8201;&#176;C (7.6&#8197;mg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to epoxy-core functional nanoparticles (3.7&#8197;mg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or non-functional nanoparticles (3.8&#8197;mg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A larger difference in &#915; is observed at 40&#8201;&#176;C; this suggests chemical adsorption of the nanoparticles rather than merely physical adsorption. A remarkable near five-fold increase in &#915; is observed for ca. 50&#8197;nm epoxy-functional nanoparticles compared to non-functional nanoparticles (31.3 vs. 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively).

         <title>Ultrathin CuF2&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Induced by Cation&#8208;Tailored Double Electrical Layer toward Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin and CuF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase is formed on CuS anode via Cu cation&#8208;tailored double electrical layer in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures high ion&#8208;conductivity and greatly suppresses the electrolyte continuous decomposition. The modified CuS enables high reversible capacity and ultralong cycling life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) seriously affects battery's cycling life, especially for high&#8208;capacity anode due to excessive electrolyte decomposition from particle fracture. Herein, we report an ultrathin SEI (3&#8211;4&#8197;nm) induced by Cu+&#8208;tailored double electrical layer (EDL) to suppress electrolyte consumption and enhance cycling stability of CuS anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unique EDL with SO3CF3&#8208;Cu complex absorbing on CuS in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte is demonstrated by in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, Cyro&#8208;TEM and theoretical calculation, in which SO3CF3&#8208;Cu could be reduced to CuF2&#8208;rich SEI. Dispersed CuF2 and F&#8208;containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption and reduce activation energy of Na+ transport. As a result, the modified CuS delivers high capacity of 402.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 7000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. The insights of SEI construction pave a way for high&#8208;stability electrode.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;ion Mobility in Li6B18(Li3N) and Li Vacancy Tuning in the Solid Solution Li6B18(Li3N)1&#8722;x(Li2O)x</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>

A new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure is reported. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18 (Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 55Li7N] strands. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18 (Li3N) and Li6B18 (Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are promising candidates for safe energy&#8208;storage systems due to non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes and the possibility to use metallic lithium as an anode. Thus, there is a challenge to design new solid electrolytes and to understand the principles of ion conduction on an atomic scale. We report on a new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18(Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 
Li7N] strands that represent a perfect cutout from the structure of &#945;&#8208;Li3N. Variable&#8208;temperature 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveals a very high Li mobility in the template phase with a remarkably low activation energy below 19&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and thus much lower than pristine Li3N. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18(Li3N) and Li6B18(Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon&lt;/b&gt; (PCH1) containing four contiguous heptagons was synthesized by Juan Casado, Junzhi Liu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202217124"&gt;e202217124&lt;/a&gt;). The four contiguous heptagons form a Z&#8197;shape in the central &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-electron skeleton, giving PCH1 a butterfly-shaped conformation.

A chiral metal&#8208;organic framework film with optoelectronic properties based on functionalized porphyrin molecules is presented by Mariana Kozlowska, Lars Heinke et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202217377). While the porphyrin molecules in solution (red) are planar, as common porphyrin, the porphyrin cores are twisted and chiral upon assembly in the metal&#8208;organic framework. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the film result in excellent photoconduction properties and sensitivity to circularly polarized light.

         <title>Inside Cover: Blocked Phosphates as Photolatent Catalysts for Dynamic Photopolymer Networks (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 10/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;resistant organic phosphate with a photolabile o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group is introduced in a visible light curable thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, as reported by Sandra Schl&#246;gl, Thomas Griesser et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202215525). The sequence&#8208;dependent &#955;&#8208;orthogonality of the curing and cleavage enables an efficient network formation at 451&#8197;nm, without premature release of the catalyst. Once the photopolymer is cured, irradiation at 372&#8197;nm spatiotemporally activates the phosphate, which catalyzes transesterifications at elevated temperature.

         <title>The First Synthesis of Subporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free base subporphyrin, also called subporphyrin can be seen as a contracted porphyrin analogue. Despite its postulated importance, its study was limited by a challenging synthesis while the first isolation of boron (III) subporphyrins was accomplished about 15&#8197;years ago. In a recent report, Kim, Osuka, and Song successfully met this challenge. This seminal work will hopefully pave the road to rich chemistries and applications in materials science.







Abstract
Because of the rich coordination chemistry and unique optical and electrochemical properties, porphyrin analogues have been intensively investigated. Among them, subporphyrins have been long&#8208;awaited molecules, with only their boron complexes known to date because of the crucial role of the central boron atom as a template in synthesis. The challenges related to the synthesis of a genuine subporphyrin (boron&#8208;free) have finally been met and reported in a recent article from Kim, Osuka, and Song. A key strategy of their synthesis lies in the introduction of an exocyclic double bond at the meso&#8208;position and subsequent reduction to obtain macrocyclic conjugation. Considering the fact that the development of porphyrin chemistry is ultimately linked to the availability of free base porphyrins, this seminal work will facilitate studies on coordination chemistry and applications in materials science.

         <title>Nanostructured Heterogeneous Catalysts for Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the use of Pd&#8208;, Au&#8208;, and Cu&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions are reviewed and discussed in detail. Synthetic strategies, applications, and external stimuli&#8208;driven processes are compiled, setting the basis for future development in this field.







Abstract

         <title>Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives on Nitrogen Electrochemistry for Carbon&#8208;Neutral Energy Technologies</title>

         <dc:description>
A closed nitrogen cycle utilizing electrochemical processes can be established between N2, NH3, and HNO3. Four essential reactions constitute an overall picture of the nitrogen transformation system, which facilitates the realization of a global carbon&#8208;free green energy network, and remedies the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle, along with the concomitant environmental crisis.







Abstract
Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable nitrogen economy. Synergistically combining multiple nitrogen reactions can realize efficient renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises. Here, we provide a unique aspect to discuss the intriguing nitrogen electrochemistry by linking three essential nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds (i.e., N2, NH3, and NO3&#8722;) and integrating four essential electrochemical reactions, i.e., the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH3OR). This minireview also summarizes the acquired knowledge of rational catalyst design and underlying reaction mechanisms for these interlinked nitrogen reactions. We further underscore the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen&#8208;based economy.

Tf2O has been widely used in synthetic chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progresses of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles, and nitro groups for the development of new reactions, and as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagents in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride has been widely used in synthetic organic chemistry, not only for the conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing compounds to the triflates, but also for the electrophilic activation and further conversion of amides, sulfoxides, and phosphorus oxides. In recent years, the utilization of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles and nitro groups has become a promising tool for the development of new valuable methods with considerable success. In addition, Tf2O has been used as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagent due to the contained SO2CF3 fragment, and significant progress has been made in this area. This review summarizes the recent progress in the applications of Tf2O in the above two aspects, and aims to illustrate the role and potential application of this reagent in organic synthesis.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oral and Transdermal Protein Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and peptide therapies are expanding for disease treatment, and the development of non&#8208;invasive or mini&#8208;invasive delivery systems is essential to improve patient compliance and therapeutic outcomes. This review provides an overview of recent advances in materials, formulations, and technologies developed to overcome biological barriers to the oral and transdermal delivery of proteins.







Abstract
Protein and peptide drugs are predominantly administered by injection to achieve high bioavailability, but this greatly compromises patient compliance. Oral and transdermal drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and high adherence represent attractive alternatives to injection administration. However, oral and transdermal administration of bioactive proteins must overcome biological barriers, namely the gastrointestinal and skin barriers, respectively. The rapid development of new materials and technologies promises to address these physiological obstacles. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in oral and transdermal protein delivery, including chemical strategies, synthetic nanoparticles, medical microdevices, and biomimetic systems for oral administration, as well as chemical enhancers, physical approaches, and microneedles in transdermal delivery. We also discuss challenges and future perspectives of the field with a focus on innovation and translation.

         <title>Direct Probe of Electrochemical Pseudocapacitive pH Jump at a Graphene Electrode
</title>

Using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation, we probe the structure and orientation of interfacial water at a graphene electrode and find phase transition&#8208;like changes. We attribute it to local pH change&#8208;induced pseudocapacitive charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate of the graphene electrode. Our work evidences the molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;level insight into interfacial water at a buried electrode interface is essential in electrochemistry, but spectroscopic probing of the interface remains challenging. Here, using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy, we directly access the interfacial water in contact with the graphene electrode supported on calcium fluoride (CaF2). We find phase transition&#8208;like variations of the HD&#8208;SFG spectra vs. applied potentials, which arises not from the charging/discharging of graphene but from the charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate through the pseudocapacitive process. The potential&#8208;dependent spectra are nearly identical to the pH&#8208;dependent spectra, evidencing that the pseudocapacitive behavior is associated with a substantial local pH change induced by water dissociation between the CaF2 and graphene. Our work evidences the local molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.

A new polar hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3 [Ni (NCS)5], features uncommon thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal transitions under mild conditions, allowing an easy fabrication of an unprecedented hybrid glass&#8208;ceramic that exhibits 25.6&#8197;times enhanced intrinsic SHG effect than its poly&#8208;crystalline form.







Abstract
Melt&#8208;quenched glasses of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals, i.e., hybrid glasses, have attracted increasing attention as an emerging class of hybrid materials with beneficial processability and formability in the past years. Herein, we present a new hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3[Ni(NCS)5] (1, Ph3PEt+=ethyl(triphenyl)phosphonium), crystallizing in a polar space group P1 and exhibiting thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal transitions with relatively low melting temperature of 132&#8201;&#176;C, glass&#8208;transition temperature of 40&#8201;&#176;C, and recrystallization on&#8208;set temperature of 78&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Taking advantage of such mild conditions, we fabricated an unprecedented hybrid glass&#8208;ceramic thin film, i.e., a thin glass uniformly embedding inner polar micro&#8208;crystals, which exhibits a much enhanced intrinsic second&#8208;order nonlinear optical effect, being ca. 25.6 and 3.1&#8197;times those of poly&#8208;crystalline 1 and KH2PO4, respectively, without any poling treatments.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Controlled Radical Branching Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble inibramer, sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate, triggered branching during photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization of methacrylate monomers in the open air. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymers with controlled molecular weights, degrees of branching, and low dispersity values were obtained in water. The radical branching polymerization also exhibited spatial control and enabled the synthesis of branched polymer bioconjugates.







Abstract
Hyperbranched polymethacrylates were synthesized by green&#8208;light&#8208;induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) under biologically relevant conditions in the open air. Sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate (SBA) was prepared in situ from commercially available 2&#8208;bromoacrylic acid and used as a water&#8208;soluble inibramer to induce branching during the copolymerization of methacrylate monomers. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymethacrylates were obtained in less than 30&#8197;min with predetermined molecular weights (36&#8201;000&lt;Mn&lt;170&#8201;000), tunable degree of branching, and low dispersity values (1.14&#8804;&#272;&#8804;1.33). Moreover, the use of SBA inibramer enabled the synthesis of bioconjugates with a well&#8208;controlled branched architecture.

         <title>Monitoring Photoinduced Interparticle Chemical Communication In Situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ monitoring of photoinduced chemical communication between single Ag nanoparticles is achieved via the stochastic collision electrochemistry. The superior sensitivity enables to investigate the dynamic chemical potential difference at the single&#8208;nanoparticle level, indicating the cooperative interparticle communication controls the morphology transformation kinetics, thereby determining the final structure of collective Ag nanoparticles.







Abstract
Monitoring interparticle chemical communication plays a critical role in the nanomaterial synthesis as this communication controls the final structure and stability of global nanoparticles (NPs). Yet most ensemble analytical techniques, which could only reveal average macroscopic information, are unable to elucidate NP&#8208;to&#8208;NP interactions. Herein, we employ stochastic collision electrochemistry to track the morphology transformation of Ag NPs in photochemical process at the single NP level. By further statistical analysis of time&#8208;resolved current transients, we quantitatively determine the dynamic chemical potential difference and interparticle communication between populations of large and small Ag NPs. The high sensitivity of stochastic collision electrochemistry enables the in situ investigation of chemical communication&#8208;dependent transformation kinetics of NPs in photochemical process, shedding light on designing nanomaterials.

         <title>Generation of Allylmagnesium Reagents by Hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
Magnesium hydride, generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride and magnesium iodide in tetrahydrofuran, was found capable of inducing regio and stereocontrolled hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes to form allylmagnesium species. Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium species with various electrophiles provided synthetically valuable synthons such as homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes.







Abstract
A protocol for the generation of allylmagnesium reagents from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes was developed using magnesium hydride (MgH2) that is generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride (NaH) and magnesium iodide (MgI2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds or alkyl (pseudo)halides delivers branched products having an allylic quaternary carbon center, whereas that with chlorosilanes resulted in formation of linear allylsilanes in regio and stereoselective manners. Further derivatizations of the homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes were also demonstrated.

         <title>Dynamics and Proton Conduction of Heterogeneously Confined Imidazole in Porous Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole confined in porous coordination polymers&#8217; channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of typical core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model, in which the core&#8208;layer possess faster rotating dynamics contributing to enhanced proton conductivity.







Abstract
The nanoconfinement of proton carrier molecules may contribute to the lowing of their proton dissociation energy. However, the free proton transportation does not occur as easily as in liquid due to the restricted molecular motion from surface attraction. To resolve the puzzle, herein, imidazole is confined in the channels of porous coordination polymers with tunable geometries, and their electric/structural relaxations are quantified. Imidazole confined in a square&#8208;shape channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model. The core and shell layer possess faster and slower structural dynamics, respectively, when compared to the bulk imidazole. The dimensions and geometry of the nanochannels play an important role in both the shielding of the blocking effect from attractive surfaces and the frustration filling of the internal proton carrier molecules, ultimately contributing to the fast dynamics and enhanced proton conductivity.

         <title>Synthesis of a Dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbon and the Impact of Non&#8208;Alternant Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon (1) has been synthesized with four contiguous heptagons that form a &#8220;Z&#8221; shape in the central &#960;&#8208;electron skeleton. The inner heptalene unit in 1 shows antiaromatic properties. PCH 1 presents narrow HOMO/LUMO energy gap as a result of the HOMO and LUMO displaying a significantly asymmetric distribution.







Abstract
Incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) can significantly affect their electronic and optoelectronic properties and chemical reactivities. Here, we report the first bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;embedded PCH (1) with four continuous heptagons, which are arranged in a &#8220;Z&#8221; shape. Compared with its structural isomer bischrysene 1&#8201;R with only hexagonal rings, compound 1 presents a distinct antiaromatic character, especially the inner heptalene core, which possesses clear antiaromatic nature. In addition, PCH 1 exhibits a narrower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap than its benzenoid contrast 1&#8201;R, as verified by experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Our work reported herein not only provides a new way to synthesize novel PCHs with non&#8208;alternant topologies but also offers the possibility to tune their electronic and optical properties.

&lt;p&gt;A polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) has been synthesized with four contiguous heptagons that form a &#8220;Z&#8221; shape in the central &#960;-electron skeleton. The inner heptalene unit in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows antiaromatic properties. PCH &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; presents narrow HOMO/LUMO energy gap as a result of the HOMO and LUMO displaying a significantly asymmetric distribution.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Superstructures via Hierarchical Assemblies of Giant Rubik's Cubes as Tertiary Building Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building unit, two unprecedented giant superclusters in Rubik's cube's form have been constructed, which further act as isolable tertiary building units to assemble cluster&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Capture of intermediate states clearly and systematically demonstrates the evolution of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures.







Abstract
Intricate superstructures possess unusual structural features and promising applications. The preparation of superstructures with single&#8208;crystalline nature are conducive to understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship, however, remains an intriguing challenge. Herein we put forward a new hierarchical assembly strategy towards rational and precise construction of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Firstly, two unprecedented superclusters in Rubik's cube's form with a size of &#8776;2&#215;2&#215;2&#8197;nm3 are constructed by aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building units (SBUs). Then, the Rubik's cubes further act as isolable tertiary building units (TBUs) to assemble diversified single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Importantly, intermediate assembly states are captured, which helps illustrate the evolution of TBU&#8208;based superstructures and thus provides a profound understanding of the assembly process of superstructures at the atomic level.

         <title>Spectroscopic Identification of Diphosphene HPPH and Isomeric Diphosphinyldene PPH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simplest diphosphene HPPH (cis and trans conformers) and diphosphinyldene PPH2 have been generated and spectroscopically characterized in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10&#8197;K. In addition to the photo&#8208;induced conversion of these P2H2 isomers, the prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties have been disclosed.







Abstract
The simplest diphosphene HPPH and isomeric diphosphinyldene PPH2 features prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties that have been of long&#8208;standing interest in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the observation of cis&#8208;HPPH, trans&#8208;HPPH, and PPH2 among the respective laser photolysis products of phosphine (PH3) and diphosphine (P2H4) in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10&#8197;K. The identification of these P2H2 isomers with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy is supported by D&#8208;isotope labeling and the quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;F12 level using configuration&#8208;selective vibrational configuration interaction theory (VCI). Bonding analyses suggest that the two conformers of HPPH contain standard PP double bonds, whereas, PPH2 resembles P2 in having partial PP triple bond due to the H2P&#8592;P &#960; bonding interaction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Lengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of multidentate ligands is made to successfully construct metal&#8208;backboned polymers with well&#8208;defined lengths and excellent optical, electrochemical, thermal and solution properties, representing a general and effective strategy to the creation of a new type of functional polymers.







Abstract
Constructing the backbones of polymers with metal atoms is an attractive strategy to develop new functional polymeric materials, but it has yet to be studied due to synthetic challenges. Here, metal atoms are interconnected as the backbones of polymers to yield metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs). Rational design of multidentate ligands synthesized via an efficient iterative approach leads to the successful construction of a series of nickel&#8208;backboned polymers (NBPs) with well&#8208;defined lengths and up to 21 nickel atoms, whose structures are systematically confirmed. These NBPs exhibit strong and length&#8208;depended absorption with narrow band gaps, offering promising applications in optoelectronic devices and semiconductors. We also demonstrate the high thermal stability and solution processsability of such nickel&#8208;backboned polymers. Our results represent a new opportunity to design and synthesize a variety of new metal&#8208;backboned polymers for promising applications in the future.

         <title>Blocked Phosphates as Photolatent Catalysts for Dynamic Photopolymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 10, March 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photolatent organophosphate is synthesized and introduced into a resin system, which is 3D printed with visible light. The subsequently UV&#8208;released transesterification catalyst activates dynamic exchange reactions at elevated temperatures. Without affecting the thermal stability of the polymer network, bond exchange reactions and shape memory can be spatiotemporally controlled.







Abstract
While latent catalysts are a well&#8208;established strategy for initiating and controlling the rate of polymerization reactions, their use in dynamic polymer networks is still in its infancy. The ideal latent catalyst should be thermally stable and release a highly active species in response to an external trigger. Here, we have synthesized a temperature resistant (&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) organic phosphate with a photolabile o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group that can be cleaved by UV light. Introduced in a visible light curable thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, the sequence&#8208;dependent &#955;&#8208;orthogonality of the curing and cleavage enables an efficient network formation at 451&#8197;nm, without premature release of the catalyst. Once cured, irradiation at 372&#8197;nm spatiotemporally activates the phosphate, which catalyzes transesterifications at elevated temperature. The formed catalyst has no effect on the thermal stability of the polymeric network and allows the activation of bond exchange reactions in selected domains of printed 3D objects.

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Showing 0D to 1D Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Structural Transition and Hysteresis Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM) hold great promise for future switching and memory devices. Herein, we report a dysprosium phosphonate [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma)2(4&#8208;hpy)2] (1Dy), which features a supramolecular framework containing layers of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and pillars of &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;interacted anthracene units. The photocycloaddition reaction of anthracene pairs led to a rapid and reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) structural transition to form the 1D coordination polymer [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma2)(4&#8208;hpy)2]n (2Dy), accompanied by photoswitchable SMM properties with the reduction of effective energy barrier by half and the narrowing of the butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop. The diluted sample showed a photo&#8208;induced switch of the blocking temperature (TB) from 3.8 K for 1Dy@Y to 2.6 K for 2Dy@Y. This work may inspire the construction of lanthanide&#8208;based molecular materials with targeted photo&#8208;responsive magnetic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Salt Dissociation Promoted by 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 Ether Additive toward Dilute Electrolytes for High Performance Lithium Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are well known for their high energy density. However, their reversibility and rate performance are challenged due to the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, serious side reactions and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth. The electrolyte plays a key role in transport&#160; of Li+&#160;and reactive oxygen species in LOBs. Here, we tailored a dilute electrolyte by screening suitable crown ether additives to promote lithium salt dissociation and Li+ solvation through electrostatic interaction. The electrolyte containing 100 mM 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether (100&#8208;18C6) exhibits enhanced electrochemical stability and triggers a solution&#8208;mediated Li2O2 growth pathway in LOBs, showing high discharge capacity of 10828.8 mAh gcarbon&#8208;1. Moreover, optimized electrode/electrolyte interfaces promote ORR/OER kinetics on cathode and achieve dendrite&#8208;free Li anode, which enhances the cycle life. This work casts new lights on the design of low&#8208;cost dilute electrolytes for high performance LOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries for the Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Biomass Aldehyderivatives and Concurrently Enhanced Power Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electricity generation and chemical productions are both critically important for the sustainable development of modern civilization. Here, a novel bifunctional Zn&#8208;organic battery has been established for the concurrent enhanced electricity output and semi&#8208;hydrogenations of a series of biomass aldehyderivatives, for the high value&#8208;added chemical syntheses. Among them, the typical Zn&#8208;furfural (FF) battery equipped with Cu foil&#8208;supported edge&#8208;enriched Cu nanosheets as cathodic electrocatalyst (Cu NS/Cu foil), provides a maximum current density and power density of 15 mA cm&#8208;2 and 2.00 mW cm&#8208;2, respectively, and in the meantime, produces high value product, furfural alcohol (FAL). The Cu NS/Cu foil catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance of ~93.5% conversion ratio and ~93.1% selectivity for FF semi&#8208;hydrogenation by using H2O as H source, and shows impressive performance for various biomass aldehyderivatives semi&#8208;hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Single&#8208;Molecule Potentiometers Based on Stapled ortho&#8208; Oligo(phenylene)ethynylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the chemical design of chiral molecular junctions with stress&#8208;dependent conductance, whose helicity is maintained during the stretching of a single molecule junction due to the stapling of both ends of the inner helix. In the reported compounds, different conductive pathways are observed, with clearly different conductance values and plateau&#8208;length distributions, attributed to different conformations of the helical structures. The large chiro&#8208;optical responses and the potential use of these molecules as unimolecular spin filters have been theoretically proved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, including a fully ab&#8208;initio estimation of the CISS&#8208;originating spin polarization which is done, for the first time, for a realistic molecular system.</dc:description>

         <title>Unbiased Screening of Novel Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials with High Thermal Conductivity: Long&#8208;neglected Nitrides and Popular Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials such as AgGaS2 are crucial to key devices for solid&#8208;state lasers, however, low laser damage thresholds intrinsically hinder their practical application. Here, a robust strategy is proposed for unbiased high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 140,000 materials to explore novel IR NLO materials with high thermal conductivity and wide bandgap which are crucial to intrinsic laser damage threshold. Via our strategy, 106 compounds with desired bandgap, NLO coefficients and thermal conductivity are screened out, including 8 nitrides, 68 chalcogenides, in which Sr2SnS4 is synthesized to verify the reliability of our process. Remarkably, thermal conductivity of nitrides is much higher than that of chalcogenides, e.g., 5 &#215; AgGaS2 (5.13 W/m&#183;K) for ZrZnN2, indicating that nitrides could be a long&#8208;neglected system for IR NLO materials. This strategy provides a powerful tool for searching NLO compounds with high thermal conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 Chalcogenide Perovskite Films Using Single&#8208;Phase Molecular Precursors at Moderate Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide perovskites have garnered interest for applications in semiconductor devices due to their excellent predicted optoelectronic properties and stability. However, high synthesis temperatures have historically made these materials incompatible with the creation of photovoltaic devices. Here, we demonstrate the solution processed synthesis of luminescent BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 chalcogenide perovskite films using single&#8208;phase molecular precursors at sulfurization temperatures of 575&#176;C and sulfurization times as short as one hour. These molecular precursor inks were synthesized using known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to create Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates, and this chemistry was extended to create species, such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have never been reported before. These findings, with added future research, have the potential to yield fully solution processed thin films of chalcogenide perovskites for various optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Bound Diarylethene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Films as Photoactuators with a Directed Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular machines and responsive materials open a plethora of new opportunities in nanotechnology. We present an oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators, arranged in a way to yield an anisotropic response. The DAE units are assembled, together with a secondary linker, into a monolithic surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. By Infrared (IR) and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy as well as by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, we show that the light&#8208;induced extension changes of the molecular DAE linkers multiply to yield mesoscopic and anisotropic length changes. Due to the special architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, leading to the bending of a cantilever and performing work. This research shows the potential of assembling light&#8208;powered molecules into SURMOFs to yield photoactuators with a directed response, presenting a path to advanced actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Boradigermaallyl: (4 + 3) Cycloaddition&#8208;Initiated Boron Insertion into Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2&#960; electron 1,3&#8208;dipole boradigermaallyl, valence&#8208;isoelectronic to an allyl cation, is synthesized from a bis(germylene). It reacts with benzene at room temperature by insertion of a boron atom into the benzene ring. Computational investigation of the mechanism shows the boradigermaallyl reacting with a benzene molecule in a concerted (4+3) or [&#960;4s + &#960;2s] cycloaddition reaction. Thus, the boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene as diene unit. This type of reactivity provides a novel platform for ligand assisted borylene insertion chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Scalable Synthesis and Optimal Adsorption and Desorption for Energy&#8208;Efficient Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative, but its advancement has been hindered by the challenge of industrially potential adsorbents development. Herein, a novel ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;901 is designed that satisfies the basic criteria raised by ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) pressure swing adsorption (PSA). ZU&#8208;901 exhibits an "S" shaped C2H4 curve with high sorbent selection parameter (65) and could be mildly regenerated. Through green aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis, ZU&#8208;901 is easily scalable with 99% yield, and it is stable in water, acid, basic solutions and cycling breakthrough experiments. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (99.51%) could be obtained via a simulating two&#8208;bed PSA process, and the corresponding energy consumption is only 1/10 of that of simulating cryogenic distillation. Our work has demonstrated the great potential of pore engineering in designing porous materials with desired adsorption and desorption behavior to implement an efficient PSA process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are appealing next&#8208;generation catalysts for various electrochemical technologies. Along with significant breakthroughs in their initial activity, SACs now face the next challenge for their viable applications, insufficient operational stability. In this Minireview, we summarize the current knowledge of SAC degradation mechanisms mainly based on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs, some of the most investigated SACs. Recent studies on isolated metal, ligand, and support degradations are introduced, and the underlying fundamentals of each degradation path are categorized into active site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) losses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects for the future outlook of stable SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Fe&#8208;Se Atom Pairs as Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts Boost Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we successfully constructed bifunctional electrocatalysts by constructing atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;Se atom pairs supported on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8208;Se/NC). The obtained Fe&#8208;Se/NC shows a noteworthy bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance with a low potential difference of 0.698 V, far superior to that of reported Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts. The theoretical calculations reveal that p&#8208;d orbital hybridization around the Fe&#8208;Se atom pairs lead to remarkably asymmetrical polarized charge distributions. Fe&#8208;Se/NC based solid&#8208;state rechargeable ZABs (ZABs&#8208;Fe&#8208;Se/NC) present stable charge/discharge of 200 h (1090 cycles) at 20 mA/cm2 at 25 oC, which is 6.9 times of ZABs&#8208;Pt/C+Ir/C. At extremely low temperature of &#8208;40 oC, ZABs&#8208;Fe&#8208;Se/NC display an ultra&#8208;robust cycling performance of 741 h (4041 cycles) at 1 mA/cm2, which is about 11.7 times longer that of ZABs&#8208;Pt/C+Ir/C. More importantly, ZABs&#8208;Fe&#8208;Se/NC could be operated for 133 h (725 cycles) even at 5 mA/cm2.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Strained Oxygen&#8208;doped Chiral Molecular Belts of Zigzag&#8208;type with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of zigzag&#8208;type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phenalenes is developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O&#8208;doped C2&#8208;symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (m) and magnetic (m) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|glum| up to 0.022). Our study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt&#8208;derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Active Sites Formed on Cobalt Oxyhydroxide in Glucose Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based oxyhydroxides are efficient catalysts in biomass electrooxidation towards fossil fuel&#8208;free production of valuable chemicals. However, identification of active sites remains elusive. Herein, using cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as the archetype and electrooxidation of glucose (GOR) as the model reaction, we track dynamic transformation of electronic and atomic structure of the catalyst using a suite of operando and ex situ techniques. We reveal that two types of reducible Co3+&#8722;oxo species are affordable for GOR, including adsorbed hydroxyl on Co3+ ion (&#181;1&#8722;OH&#8722;Co3+) and di&#8208;Co3+&#8208;bridged lattice oxygen (&#181;2&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+). Moreover, theoretical calculations unveil that &#181;1&#8722;OH&#8722;Co3+ is responsible for oxygenation, while &#181;2&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+ mainly contributes to dehydrogenation, both as key oxidative steps in glucose&#8208;to&#8208;formate transformation. This work provides a framework for mechanistic understanding of the complex near&#8208;surface chemistry of metal oxyhydroxides in biomass electrorefining.</dc:description>

         <title>Deacylative Thiolation by Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Fragmentation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the development of deacylative thiolation of diverse methyl ketones. The reaction is redox&#8208;neutral, and heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free, which provides a new way to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. It also features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, thus allowing late&#8208;stage derivatization. The process benefits from efficient condensation between the activation reagent and ketone substrates, which triggers aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;C fragmentation and rapid radical coupling with thiosulfonates. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular engineering to enhance reactivity and selectivity in an ultrafast photoclick reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;induced 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloadditions are an attractive new type of photoclick reaction, featuring fast conversions and high biocompatibility. However, the tunability of the reaction was hardly investigated up to now. To this end, we explored the influence of substituents on both reaction partners and the reaction rate between the PQs and ERAs. We identified new handles for functionalization and discovered that using enamines as ERAs led to drastically enhanced rates (&gt;5400 times faster), high photoreaction quantum yields (&#934;P, up to 65 %), and multicolor emission output as well as high fluorescence quantum yield of the adducts (&#934;F, up to 97%). Further investigation of the photophysical and photochemical properties provided the insights to design orthogonal reaction systems both in solution and on nanoparticle surfaces for ultrafast chemoselective functionalization by photoclick.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;like Sulfur&#8208;Containing Plastics from Sustainable Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new family of chemically recyclable polymers in a large scale from sustainable monomers of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. Such resultant polymers manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to commodity polyethylene. The chemical recycling of these polymers can be readily achieved through two closed loops.







Abstract
The green revolution in plastics should be accelerated due to growing sustainability concerns. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable polymers from the first reported cascade polymerization of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. In addition to abundant feedstocks, the method is efficient and air&#8208;tolerant, uses common organic bases as catalysts, and yields polymers with high molecular weights under mild conditions. Such polymers, structurally like polyethylene with low&#8208;density in&#8208;chain polar groups, manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to high&#8208;density polyethylene. The in&#8208;chain ester group acts as a breaking point, enabling these polymers to undergo chemical recycling through two loops. The structures and properties of these polymers also have an immeasurably expanded range owing to the versatility of our method. The readily available raw materials, facile synthesis, and high performance make these polymers promising prospects as sustainable materials in practice.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Cyclobutenone Ketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bench&#8208;stable cyclobutenone surrogates that undergo Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl&#8208; and vinylboronic acids to yield cyclobutenyl enol ethers in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This transformation proceeds via enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination. The reaction is fast and proceeds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Complex cyclobutanes are important motifs in both bioactive molecules and natural products, yet their enantioselective preparation has not been widely explored. In this work, we describe rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective additions of aryl and vinyl boronic acids to cyclobutenone ketals. This transformation involves enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination to afford enantioenriched enol ethers. Overall, this addition serves as a surrogate for Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions to cyclobutenone.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Molecule&#8208;Regulated Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Solvation Electrolyte for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries at Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amphiphilic solvent is rationally designed to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure bestows improved ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy, and highly robust and conductive SEI, which overcomes the long&#8208;standing Li compatibility and deposition kinetic challenges, enabling the stable operation of Li&#8208;metal battery under ultra&#8208;low temperature.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries hold great promise for promoting energy density and operating at low temperatures, yet they still suffer from insufficient Li compatibility and slow kinetic, especially at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. Herein, we rationally design and synthesize a new amphiphilic solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methoxypropane, for use in battery electrolytes. The lithiophilic segment is readily to solvate Li+ to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure not only largely improves the ionic conductivity to allow fast Li+ transport and lower the desolvation energy to enable facile desolvation, but also leads to the formation of a highly robust and conductive inorganic SEI. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high Li efficiency and superior cycling stability from room temperature to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at high current densities. Meanwhile, anode&#8208;free high&#8208;voltage cell retains 87&#8201;% capacity after 100 cycles.

         <title>Plasmonic Cu Nanoparticles for the Low&#8208;temperature Photo&#8208;driven Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived plasmonic Cu catalyst was synthesized for the photo&#8208;driven water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Light&#8208;induced hot electrons led to efficient *H2O activation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway. High hydrogen production rate (114.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) was realized at 200&#8201;&#176;C through the plasmonic Cu&#8208;mediated strategy, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for (photo&#8208;)thermal WGSR catalyst at low temperatures.







Abstract
The activation of water molecules in thermal catalysis typically requires high temperatures, representing an obstacle to catalyst development for the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Plasmonic photocatalysis allows activation of water at low temperatures through the generation of light&#8208;induced hot electrons. Herein, we report a layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived copper catalyst (LD&#8208;Cu) with outstanding performance for the low&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;driven WGSR. LD&#8208;Cu offered a lower activation energy for WGSR to H2 under UV/Vis irradiation (1.4&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) compared to under dark conditions. Detailed experimental studies revealed that highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles created an abundance of hot electrons during light absorption, which promoted *H2O dissociation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway, leading to the efficient production of H2. Results demonstrate the benefits of exploiting plasmonic phenomena in the development of photo&#8208;driven low&#8208;temperature WGSR catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization toward Ultrathin COF Membranes for Brine Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy, which actively manipulates the self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect during electrochemical process, is developed for fabricating ultrathin and robust COF membranes for efficient brine desalination.







Abstract
Ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are urgently demanded in molecular/ionic separations. Herein, we reported an electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy to fabricate ultrathin COF membranes with thickness of 85&#8197;nm, by actively manipulate self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect. The resulting COF membrane exhibited superior performance in brine desalination with the permeation flux of 92&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and the rejection of 99.96&#8201;%. Our electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy enriches the fabrication approach of COF membranes and facilitates the rational design of ultrathin membranes.

         <title>Ion Co&#8208;storage in Porous Organic Frameworks through On&#8208;site Coulomb Interactions for High Energy and Power Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Coulomb interaction&#8208;promoted ion kinetics enables a dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage electrode with high energy and power densities.







Abstract
Fast and continuous ion insertion is blocked in the common electrodes operating with widely accepted single&#8208;ion storage mechanism, primarily due to Coulomb repulsion between the same ions. It results in an irreconcilable conflict between capacity and rate performance. Herein, we designed a porous organic framework with novel multiple&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage modes, including PF6&#8722;/Li+, OTF&#8722;/Mg2+, and OTF&#8722;/Zn2+ co&#8208;storage. The Coulomb interactions between cationic and anionic carriers in the framework can significantly promote electrode kinetics, by rejuvenating fast ion carrier migration toward framework interior. Consequently, the framework via PF6&#8722;/Li+ co&#8208;storage mode shows a high energy density of 878&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 cycled more than 20&#8201;000 cycles, with an excellent power density of 28&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 that is already comparable to commercial supercapacitors. The both greatly improved energy and power densities via the co&#8208;storage mode may pave a way for exploring new electrodes that are not available from common single&#8208;ion electrodes.

         <title>Evidence of AlII Radical Addition to Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron reduction of diamido&#8208;naphthyl aluminum iodide in benzene produces dialuminyl substituted Birch&#8208;type reduction product. Time dependent EPR experiments in combination with DFT calculations suggest a reaction mechanism where stable AlII radical intermediates play a crucial role for the reaction outcome. The aluminum radical stability is a consequence of a rigid supporting ligand with silyl protective substituents.







Abstract
Electrophilic AlIII species have long dominated the aluminum reactivity towards arenes. Recently, nucleophilic low&#8208;valent AlI aluminyl anions have showcased oxidative additions towards arenes C&#8722;C and/or C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we communicate compelling evidence of an AlII radical addition reaction to the benzene ring. The electron reduction of a ligand stabilized precursor with KC8 in benzene furnishes a double addition to the benzene ring instead of a C&#8722;H bond activation, producing the corresponding cyclohexa&#8208;1,3(orl,4)&#8208;dienes as Birch&#8208;type reduction product. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT results suggest this reactivity proceeds through a stable AlII radical intermediate, whose stability is a consequence of a rigid scaffold in combination with strong steric protection.

         <title>Directed Asymmetric Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Electronically Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly diastereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes was developed. Additionally, the enantioselective variant with unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes was also achieved, delivering various polyarylalkanes bearing benzylic stereocenters with good to high enantioselectivities and excellent diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diarylation of electronically unactivated alkenes has emerged as an extensive research topic in organic synthesis. However, most examples are mainly limited to terminal alkenes. Furthermore, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated alkenes still remains unsolved and is a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a highly efficient directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes with high diastereoselectivities. More importantly, our further effort towards enantioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of the unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes is achieved, furnishing various polyarylalkanes featuring benzylic stereocenters in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities and high diastereoselectivities. Interestingly, the generation of cationic Ni&#8208;catalyst by adding alkali metal fluoride is the key to increased efficiency of this enantioselective reaction.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations Guide Chimeragenesis and Engineered Control of Chemoselectivity in Diketopiperazine Dimerases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of C&#8722;N bond forming diketopiperazine dimerase, AspB, was solved. However, the near complete superposition of active site residues and bound substrates in AspB/NzeB masked the molecular basis for their orthogonal chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics simulations guided rational chimeragenesis to reprogram NzeB dimerase selectivity. Substrate mimics further validated differential substrate binding by the chemodivergent dimerases.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the tryptophan&#8208;linked dimeric diketopiperazines (DKPs), cytochromes P450 selectively couple DKP monomers to generate a variety of intricate and isomeric frameworks. To determine the molecular basis for selectivity of these biocatalysts we obtained a high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of selective Csp2&#8722;N bond forming dimerase, AspB. Overlay of the AspB structure onto C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming homolog NzeB revealed no significant structural variance to explain their divergent chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified a region of NzeB with increased conformational flexibility relative to AspB, and interchange of this region along with a single active site mutation led to a variant that catalyzes exclusive C&#8722;N bond formation. MD simulations also suggest that intermolecular C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation results from a change in mechanism, supported experimentally through use of a substrate mimic.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular Radical Amidation and Amination of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds via Dual Copper and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for enantioselective intermolecular benzylic C&#8722;H amidation and amination is reported. This dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation displays broad substrate scope and good atom economy, is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and enables easy access to 15N&#8208;labeling from cheap [15N]&#8208;NH4Cl.







Abstract
A method for direct access to enantioenriched benzylic amides and carbamate&#8208;protected primary benzylamines by C&#8722;H functionalization is reported. The C&#8722;H substrate is used as limiting reagent with only a small excess of the unactivated amide or carbamate nucleophile. The enantioselective intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is enabled by a combination of a chiral copper catalyst, a photocatalyst, and an oxidant, and it takes place under mild conditions, which allow for a broad substrate scope. The method is compatible with late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and it provides easy access to 15N&#8208;labeled amides and amines starting from cheap 15NH4Cl.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Independent and Cell&#8208;Free Biosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids Using Vinyl Esters as Smart Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;enzyme cell&#8208;free system transforms vinyl esters into &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids in the absence of ATP and ancillary electron donors through concurrent abiotic thiolysis, non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, ketone reduction and hydrolysis steps. The same substrate provides the energy to activate the acyl group and the redox power to reduce the condensed ketone.







Abstract
In vitro biosynthetic pathways that condense and reduce molecules through coenzyme A (CoASH) activation demand energy and redox power in the form of ATP and NAD(P)H, respectively. These coenzymes must be orthogonally recycled by ancillary reactions that consume chemicals, electricity, or light, impacting the atom economy and/or the energy consumption of the biosystem. In this work, we have exploited vinyl esters as dual acyl and electron donor substrates to synthesize &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids through a non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, reduction and hydrolysis stepwise cascade, including a NADH recycling step, catalyzed by a total of 4 enzymes. Herein, the chemical energy to activate the acyl group with CoASH and the redox power for the reduction are embedded into the vinyl esters. Upon optimization, this self&#8208;sustaining cascade reached a titer of (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy butyrate of 24&#8197;mM without requiring ATP and simultaneously recycling CoASH and NADH. This work illustrates the potential of in vitro biocatalysis to transform simple molecules into multi&#8208;functional ones.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Investigation, Storage, and Separation of Pyrophoric PH3 and P2H4 with &#945;&#8208;Mg Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphane, PH3, is a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas that is often contaminated with H2 and P2H4. The inexpensive &#945;&#8208;Mg formate MOF adsorbs up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3 and allows safe handling of phosphane in air. This MOF is moreover a candidate for PH3 purification and longtime P2H4 storage in air and at room temperature.







Abstract
Phosphane, PH3&#8212;a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas&#8212;is frequently contaminated with H2 and P2H4, which makes its handling even more dangerous. The inexpensive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) magnesium formate, &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], can adsorb up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3. The PH3&#8208;loaded MOF, PH3@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], is a non&#8208;pyrophoric, recoverable material that even allows brief handling in air, thereby minimizing the hazards associated with the handling and transport of phosphane. &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] further plays a critical role in purifying PH3 from H2 and P2H4: at 25&#8201;&#176;C, H2 passes through the MOF channels without adsorption, whereas PH3 adsorbs readily and only slowly desorbs under a flow of inert gas (complete desorption time&#8776;6&#8197;h). Diphosphane, P2H4, is strongly adsorbed and trapped within the MOF for at least 4&#8197;months. P2H4@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] itself is not pyrophoric and is air&#8208; and light&#8208;stable at room temperature.

         <title>Amphoteric Cellulose&#8208;Based Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Electrolyte Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a flexible amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte. The amphoteric groups not only promoted the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions, but also guided the Zn2+ deposition to inhibit dendrite growth, thus resulting in a ultra&#8208;stable Zn anode.







Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal anode suffers from uncontrollable Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions at the interface, which restrict the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries (ARZBs). Herein, an amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network is introduced as hydrogel electrolyte to overcome these obstacles. On one hand, the amphoteric groups build anion/cation transport channels to regulate electro&#8208;deposition behavior on Zn (002) crystal plane enabled by homogenizing Zn2+ ions flux. On the other hand, the strong bonding between negatively charged carboxyl groups and Zn2+ ions promote the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions. Based on the above two functions, the hydrogel electrolyte enables an ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a cumulative capacity of 7&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn cell. This work provides significant concepts for developing hydrogel electrolytes to realize stable anode for high&#8208;performance ARZBs.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Nitric Oxide&#8208;Responsive Nanosensor for Photoacoustic Imaging in the SWIR Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of new SWIR dyes based on the xanthene core was synthesized using C&#8722;H activation chemistry. We showcased the biomedical utility of these imaging agents by selecting one example for the development of a ratiometric nanosensor, which we employed to detect elevated levels of nitric oxide in a murine model of drug&#8208;induced liver injury via SWIR PA imaging.







Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) dyes are characterized by their ability to absorb light from 900 to 1400&#8197;nm, which is ideal for deep tissue imaging owing to minimized light scattering and interference from endogenous pigments. An approach to access such molecules is to tune the photophysical properties of known near&#8208;infrared dyes. Herein, we report the development of a series of easily accessible (three steps) SWIR xanthene dyes based on a dibenzazepine donor conjugated to thiophene (SCR&#8208;1), thienothiophene (SCR&#8208;2), or bithiophene (SCR&#8208;3). We leverage the fact that SCR&#8208;1 undergoes a bathochromic shift when aggregated for in vivo studies by developing a ratiometric nanoparticle for NO (rNP&#8208;NO), which we employed to successfully visualize pathological levels of nitric oxide in a drug&#8208;induced liver injury model via deep tissue SWIR photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Our work demonstrates how easily this dye series can be utilized as a component in nanosensor designs for imaging studies.

         <title>A Diode&#8208;Like Dye&#8208;Cu Anisotropic Junction in a Coordination Polymer as a Logic State Ratchet for Intratumor Redox Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox logic materials offer new avenues to modulate intracellular pathologic redox environment area&#8208;specifically, but the unambiguity of redox logic states and their unidirectional and repetitive switchability are challenging to realize. By merging a bistable diisophthalic phenazine dye ligand with Cu(II) salt, a multistable coordination polymer (CP) was constructed, of which the dye&#8208;Cu anisotropic junction achieved the diode&#8208;like unidirectional electron transfer and logic state ratchet for the first time. Radical cationic CP maintained OFF status with low toxicity in healthy tissues, but was reduced to the neutral SERVO state by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in hypoxic tumors. After photoirradiation, the stabilized charge&#8208;separated ON status promoted photo&#8208;Fenton reaction for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction, and simultaneously recovered the initial state for catalytic signal amplification of ROS, furnishing intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbons in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) are promising candidates as oxygen electrocatalysts due to their low cost, tunable catalytic activity and selectivity, and well&#8208;dispersed morphologies. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of such systems, it is critical to gain a detailed understanding of their structure and properties through advanced characterization. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) serves as a powerful tool to probe both the active sites and structural evolution of catalytic materials under reaction conditions. In this review, we firstly provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of XAS and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are subsequently discussed in detail. Finally, major challenges and future opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Deprotonation of CH3CN by an Iron&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the first double deprotonation of acetonitrile (CH3CN) using two equivalents of a bimetallic iron&#8208;aluminium complex. The products of this reaction contain an exceeding simple yet rare [CHCN]2&#8211; dianion moiety that bridges two metal fragments. DFT calculations suggest that the bonding to the metal centres occurs through heavily polarised covalent interactions. Mechanistic studies reveal the intermediacy of a monomeric [CH2CN]&#8211; complex, which has been characterised in&#8208;situ. Our findings provide an important example in which a bimetallic metal complex achieves a new type of reactivity not previously encountered with monometallic counterparts.&#160;The isolation of a [CHCN]2&#8211; dianion through simple deprotonation of CH3CN also offers the possibility of a establishing a broader chemistry of this motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination Improves Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by a Mononuclear Ru Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular electrocatalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion often operate at large overpotentials, due to the large barrier for C&#8208;O bond cleavage. Illustrated with ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts, we herein propose a mechanistic route that involves one metal center that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle, by density functional theory in corroboration with experimental FTIR. The nucleophilic character of the Ru center manifests itself in the initial attack on CO2 to form [Ru&#8208;CO2]0, while its electrophilic character allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate, [Ru&#8208;CO2CO2]0,c, by addition of a second CO2 molecule and intramolecular cyclization. The calculated activation barrier for C&#8208;O bond cleavage via the metallacycle is decreased by 34.9 kcal mol&#8210;1 as compared to the non&#8208;cyclic adduct. Such metallacyclic intermediates in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offer a new design feature that can be implemented consciously in future catalyst designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Narrowband Circularly Polarized Light Emitters Based on 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded Rigid Donor&#8211;Acceptor Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrow&#8208;band emission is essential for applicable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active materials in ultrahigh&#8208;definition CP&#8208;OLEDs. One of the most promising classes of CPL active molecules, helicenes, however, typically exhibit broad emission with a large Stokes shift. We present, herein, a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between nitrogen and boron atoms to address this issue. 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded configurationally stable single&#8208; and double helicenes were synthesized straightforwardly. Both helicenes show unprecedentedly narrow fluorescence and CPL bands (full width at half maximum between 17&#8211;28 nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13 eV) along with high fluorescence quantum yields (72&#8211;85%). Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the relative localization of the natural transition orbitals, mainly on the rigid core of the molecule, and small values of root&#8208;mean&#8208;square displacements between S0 and S1 state geometries, contribute to the narrower emission.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Cascade Reaction in an Engineered Protein Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we describe the creation of an artificial protein cage housing a dual metal&#8208;tagged guest protein that catalyzes a linear, two&#8208;step sequential cascade reaction. The guest protein consists of a fusion protein of HaloTag and monomeric rhizavidin. Inside the protein capsid, we establish a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed allylcarbamate deprotection followed by a gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing hydroamination reaction that leads to indoles and phenanthridines with an overall yield of up to 66% in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, we show that the encapsulation stabilizes the metal catalysts against deactivation by air, proteins and cell lysate.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Structure&#8208;Performance Relationships in Designing Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prerequisite for commercially viable organic solar cells (OSC) is to reduce the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost gap. Therefore, the cost of organic materials should be reduced by minimizing the synthetic steps, yet maintaining the molecular planarity and efficiencies achieved by the fused ring acceptors (FRA).&#160;In this respect, developing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRA) with suitable functionalization to favor conformational planarity and effective molecular packing is beneficial and cost&#8208;effective. Presently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for NFRAs is around 16%, yet lower than the 19% achieved for FRAs. Despite their potential, a thorough understanding of the effective structural design of NFRAs is necessary for developing efficient OSCs. This article pays special attention to the molecular design concept for NFRAs developed in the last years and analyzed the approach toward materials design and efficiency improvement, an important step toward technological application.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Alignment&#8208;Induced Chemically&#8208;Patchy Uniaxial Nanoparticles and Their Applications in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Self&#8208;Assembled Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unusual strategy for synthesizing patchy nanoparticles (NPs) by controlling the orientation of the molecules that form the NPs. This is realized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal (LC) monomers during scalable precipitation polymerization. The resulting NPs are cylinders with highly uniform shapes and have only a single LC domain. The patchy properties originate from the discrepancy of surface chemical compositions on flat and side surfaces and can be switched on and off by solvent. Extra colloidal blocks can be grown onto the patches, resulting in highly uniform triblock patchy dumbbells, which have integrated optical properties, and as demonstrated, show triple&#8208;mode optical authentication in anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels or patterns. We also demonstrate that the triblock patchy cylinders are attractive building blocks for long LC rods or porous colloidal materials through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;silica zeolite ECNU&#8208;13 (Si/Al = 23) with a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pore system and a nanosized morphology has been developed, consisting of multitudes of 10&#8208;membered ring (10&#8208;R) medium pores and one set of 8&#8208;R small pores. A phase&#8208;discrimination&#160;strategy was proposed to synthesize ECNU&#8208;13 by regulating the gel compositions and nucleation processes that were used for preparing 12&#8208;R large&#8208;pore germanosilicate IM&#8208;20 with the known UWY topology. The crystallization was directed towards forming one set of single four&#8208;ring (s4r) composite building units together with one set of double four&#8208;ring (d4r) rather than two different types of d4r units in IM&#8208;20. The electron crystallographic investigations elucidated that the ECNU&#8208;13 structure was composed of two kinds of polymorphs as a result of distinct atomic positionings in s4r units. In catalytic cracking of 1&#8208;butene, ECNU&#8208;13 exhibited high propene selectivity (55.6%) and propene to ethylene molar ratio (&gt; 4.7) superior to well&#8208;studied conventional ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of alkane isomers is an important yet challenging process in the petrochemical industry. Being a crucial step to produce premium gasoline components as well as optimum ethylene feed, the current industrial separation by distillation is extremely energy intensive. Adsorptive separation based on zeolite is limited by insufficient adsorption capacity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold enormous promise as alternative adsorbents due to their diverse structural tunability and exceptional porosity. Precise control of their pore geometry/dimensions has led to superior performance. In this minireview, we highlight the recent progresses in developing MOFs for the separation of C6 alkane isomers. Representative MOFs are reviewed based on their separation mechanisms. Emphasis is put on the material design rationale for achieving optimal separation capability. Finally, we briefly discuss the existing challenges, possible solutions, and future directions of this important field.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for the chiral iron porphyrin catalyzed transformation of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides into chiral indolines and sultams, respectively. The reaction proceeds upon visible light irradiation and with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is appealing for synthetic applications due to the biocompatibility and high earth abundance of iron, but examples of such reactions are sparse. Herein we describe chiral iron complexes of meso&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;porphyrins that can catalyze asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to afford chiral indolines (29 examples) and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides (17 examples), respectively, with up to 93&#8201;% ee (yield: up to 99&#8201;%) using 410&#8197;nm light under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO2Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO2Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.

Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preferential Adsorption of Ethylene Oxide on Fe and Chlorine on Ni Enabled Scalable Electrosynthesis of Ethylene Chlorohydrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preferential adsorption of ethylene oxide on Fe and chlorine on Ni enable electrosynthesis of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) with high conversion and selectivity. Scalable production of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH with 92.5&#8201;% yield at 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;h, paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid (an herbicide), and successful fabrication of a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols highlight the potential utilities.







Abstract
Industrial manufacturing of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) critically requires excess corrosive hydrochloric acid or hypochlorous acid with dealing with massive by&#8208;products and wastes. Here we report a green and efficient electrosynthesis of ECH from ethylene oxide (EO) with NaCl over a NiFe2O4 nanosheet anode. Theoretical results suggest that EO and Cl preferentially adsorb on Fe and Ni sites, respectively, collaboratively promoting the ECH synthesis. A Cl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening process is proposed and confirmed, and the key Cl and carbon radical species are identified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. This strategy can enable scalable electrosynthesis of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH in 1&#8197;h with 92.5&#8201;% yield at a 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density. Furthermore, a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols with good to high yields and paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid via respectively loading and unloading Cl are achieved, showing the promising potential of this strategy.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Radical 1,2&#8208;Carbophosphonylation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes from readily available alkyl halides and dialkyl phosphites is developed. The key to the success of the strategy lies in not only the proper choosing of phosphorus reagents to suppress the reverse chemoselectivity but also the utilization of a chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical difunctionalization of alkenes from readily available alkyl halides and organophosphorus reagents possessing a P&#8722;H bond provides an appealing approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl phosphorus compounds. The major challenge arises from the easy generation of a P&#8208;centered radical from the P&#8722;H&#8208;type reagent and its facile addition to the terminal side of alkenes, leading to reverse chemoselectivity. We herein disclose a radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner. The key to the success lies in not only the implementation of dialkyl phosphites with a strong bond dissociation energy to promote the desired chemoselectivity but also the utilization of an anionic chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge the chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond. The developed Cu/N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst has enriched our library of single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts in the enantioselective radical transformations.

Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for versatile applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields.

Abstract
Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for many applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields. The development of a permselective lamellar membrane constructed from parallel stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets opened a new avenue for the development of next&#8208;generation separation technology because of the unprecedented diversity of the designable interior nanochannels. In this Review, we first discuss the construction of homo&#8208; and heterolaminar nanoarchitectures from the starting materials to the emerging preparation strategies. We then explore the property&#8211;performance relationships, with a particular emphasis on the effects of physical structural features, chemical properties, and external environment stimuli on ion transport behavior under nanoconfinement. We also present existing and potential applications of 2D membranes in desalination, ion recovery, and energy conversion. Finally, we discuss the challenges and outline research directions in this promising field.

         <title>Halide Layer Cathodes for Compatible and Fast&#8208;Charged Halides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium intercalation chemistry in layered VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) enabled by compatible halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes was explored for the first time. The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial stability can be achieved in a thermodynamic manner instead of a passivation process, ensured by the good chemical stability between the VX3 cathode and halide electrolytes as well as the wide electrochemical stability windows.







Abstract
Insertion&#8208;type compounds based on oxides and sulfides have been widely identified and well&#8208;studied as cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, halides have rarely been used due to their high solubility in organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we reveal the insertion electrochemistry of VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) by introducing a compatible halide solid&#8208;state electrolyte with a wide electrochemical stability window. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal a two&#8208;step lithiation process and the structural transition of typical VCl3. Fast Li+ insertion/extraction in the layered VX3 active materials and favorable interface guaranteed by the compatible electrode&#8208;electrolyte design enables high rate capability and stable operation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;VX3 batteries. The findings from this study will contribute to developing intercalation insertion electrochemistry of halide materials and exploring novel electrode materials in viable energy storage systems.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching in an FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of an FeIII complex in solution is observed at room temperature. A reversible magnetic response was detected in the complex, [FeIII(sal2323)]ClO4 (1), using Evans&#8217; method 1H NMR spectroscopy which indicated cumulative switching from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin upon addition of one and two equivalents of acid. Infrared spectroscopy suggests a coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) effect, whereby protonation displaces the metal&#8208;phenoxo donors. The analogous complex, [FeIII(4&#8208;NEt2&#8208;sal2323)]ClO4 (2), with a diethylamino group on the ligand, was used to combine the magnetic change with a colorimetric response. Comparison of the protonation responses of 1 and 2 reveals that the magnetic switching is caused by perturbation of the immediate coordination sphere of the complex. These complexes constitute a new class of analyte sensor which operate by magneto&#8208;modulation, and in the case of 2 also yield a colorimetric response.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to &gt;1 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 C2+ Products Using Copper Catalysts Dispersed on MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet House&#8722;of&#8722;Cards Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu catalysts are most apt for reducing CO(2) to multi&#8208;carbon products in aqueous electrolytes. To enhance the product yield, we can increase the overpotential and the catalyst mass loading. However, these approaches can cause inadequate mass transport of the CO(2) to the catalytic sites, which will then lead to H2 evolution dominating the product selectivity. Herein, we use a MgAl LDH nanosheet &#8216;house&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; scaffold to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu). With this support&#8208;catalyst design, at &#8722;0.7 VRHE, CO could be reduced to C2+ products with a current density (jC2+) of &#8722;1251 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. This is 14&#215; that of the jC2+ shown by unsupported OD&#8208;Cu. The current densities of C2+ alcohols and C2H4 were also high at &#8722;369 and &#8722;816 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 respectively. We propose that the porosity of the LDH nanosheet scaffold enhances CO diffusion through the Cu sites. The CO reduction rate can thus be increased, while minimizing H2 evolution, even when high catalyst loadings and large overpotentials are used.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Nonlinear Optical Switch with a Linearly Tunable Tc Spanning a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) switch materials that turn on/off second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at a phase transition temperature (Tc) are promising for applications in the fields of photoswitching and optical computing. However, precise control of Tc remains challenging, mainly because a linearly tunable Tc has not been reported to date. Herein, we report a unique selenate, tetragonal P [[EQUATION]] 21c [Ag(NH3)2]2SeO4 with a = b = 8.5569(2) &#197; and c = 6.5208(2) &#197; that exhibits a strong SHG intensity (1.3 &#215; KDP) and a large birefringence (&#916;nobv. = 0.08). This compound forms a series of isostructural solid&#8208;solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2S x Se1&#8208; x O4 (x = 0&#8722;1.00) that exhibit excellent NLO switching performance and an unprecedented linearly tunable  [[EQUATION]]  spanning 430 to 356 K. The breaking of localized hydrogen bonds between SeO42&#8208; and the cation triggers a phase transition accompanied by hydrogen bond length changes with increasing x and a linear change in the enthalpy  [[EQUATION]] .</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Probe for Nuclear ATP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence monitoring of ATP in different organelles is now feasible with a few biosensors developed, which, however, show low sensitivity, limited biocompatibility, and accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule ATP probes that alleviate those limitations thus have received much attention recently, leading to a few ATP probes that target several organelles except for the nucleus. We disclose the first small&#8208;molecule probe that selectively detects nuclear ATP through reversible binding, with 25&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH 7.4 and excellent selectivity against various biologically relevant species. Using the probe, we observed 2.1&#8211;3.3&#8208;fold and 3.9&#8211;7.8&#8208;fold higher nuclear ATP levels in cancerous cell lines and tumor tissues compared with normal cell lines and tissues, respectively, which are explained by the higher nuclear ATP level in the mitosis phase. The probe has great potential for studying nuclear ATP&#8208;associated biology.</dc:description>

         <title>ARMOR: Auto&#8208;Assembled Resilient Biomimetic Calcified Ornaments for Selective Cell Protection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Driven Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike plant and microbial cells having cell walls, the outermost layer of mammalian cell is a delicate, two&#8208;layered structure of phospholipids with proteins embedded, which is susceptible to environmental changes. It is necessary to create an &#8220;armor&#8221; on cell surface to protect cell integrity. Here, we propose an Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy driven by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. This co&#8208;recognition design enhances the selectivity and leverages robust in&#8208;situ signal amplification by HCR to improve the sensitivity. The calcified shell is cogenerated by crosslinking the alginate&#8208;HCR product with Ca2+ ion. ARMOR has high efficiency for shielding cells from environmental assaults, which can be applied to circulating tumor cell (CTC) protection, isolation, and identification, maintaining the native state and intact genetic information for downstream analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel chiral nanographene (i.e., EP9H) with pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized and fully characterized. Notably, Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction unambiguously confirms the helical structure. The fluorescence emission of EP9H locates in the near infrared region (&#955;em = 684 nm) with a medium quantum yield (0.10) of helicene derivatives. Cyclic voltammetry reveals its seven quasi&#8208;reversible redox states from &#8208;2 to +5. Furthermore, enantiopure EP9H displays distinct CD signals in a broad spectral range from 300 to 700 nm. Compared to the reported small organic molecules, EP9H displays outstanding |glum| as 4.50 &#215; 10&#8208;2 and BCPL as 304 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Unequal Perylene Diimide Twins in a Quadruple Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural light&#8208;harvesting (LH) systems can divide identical dyes into unequal aggregate states, thereby achieving intelligent &#8220;allocation of labour&#8221;. From a synthetic point of view, construction of such kind of unequal and integrated systems without the help of proteinaceous scaffolding is challenging. Here, we show that four octatetrayne&#8208;bridged ortho&#8208;perylene diimide (PDI) dyads (POPs) self&#8208;assemble into a quadruple assembly (POP)4 both in solution and in the solid state. The two identical PDI units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550) in (POP)4.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Natural light-harvesting (LH) systems can divide identical dyes into unequal aggregate states, thereby achieving intelligent &#8220;allocation of labour&#8221;. From a synthetic point of view, construction of such kind of unequal and integrated systems without the help of proteinaceous scaffolding is challenging. Here, we show that four octatetrayne-bridged ortho-perylene diimide (PDI) dyads (POPs) self-assemble into a quadruple assembly (POP)4 both in solution and in the solid state. The two identical PDI units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550) in (POP)4. The two extreme pools of PDI chromophores were unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray and NMR results. To interpret the formation of the discrete quadruple assembly, we also develop a two-step cooperative model. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate the existence of multiple-couplings within and cross P520 and P550, which can satisfactorily describe the photophysical properties of the unequal quadruple assembly .  This finding is expected to help advance the rational design of dye stacks to emulate functions of natural LH systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Intermolecular Charge Separation&#160;of&#160;Cationic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A&#160;quadrupolar&#160;compound&#160;Pyr&#8208;BA&#160;with two pyrrole&#8208;type nitrogen atoms doped externally was prepared in this work. In high contrast with other&#160;&#960;&#160;ionic radicals, its cationic radical&#160;Pyr&#8208;BA&#183;+ &#160;undergoes unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), generating the mixed valence complex of&#160;Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8208;q&#183;&#183;&#183;Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) single crystal analysis, absorption and&#160;EPR&#160;experiments&#160;all confirmed that aggregation and lower temperature would help to facilitate this SB&#8208;CS process. Gibbs energy calculations and&#160;gauge&#8208;including magnetically induced current simulation&#160;both validate that, for&#160;Pyr&#8208;BA&#183;+ , &#160; SB&#8208;CS behavior is more favorable than the conventional dimerization mode. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that shows solid single crystal evidence for spontaneous SB&#8208;CS between identical ionic radicals.&#160;Such unique phenomenon is of great significance both in fundamental aspects and in uncharted material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion Enabled&#160;by Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Triatomic Sites in Partially Oxidized Bimetallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective CO2 photoreduction into C2 fuels under mild conditions suffers from low product yield and poor selectivity owing to the kinetic challenge of C&#8211;C coupling. Here, triatomic sites are introduced into bimetallic sulfide to promote C&#8722;C coupling for selectively forming C2 products. As an example, FeCoS2 atomic layers with different oxidation degrees are first synthesized, demonstrated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Both experiment and theoretical calculation verify more charges aggregate around the introduced oxygen atom, which enables the original Co&#8211;Fe dual sites to turn into Co&#8211;O&#8211;Fe triatomic sites, thus promoting C&#8211;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates. Accordingly, the mildly oxidized FeCoS2 atomic layers exhibit C2H4 formation rate of 20.1 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with the product selectivity and electron selectivity of 82.9% and 96.7%, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts under similar conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity of Clamp&#8208;Shaped Cobalt(II) Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular structure, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) features of two Co(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes bearing Ph or F5Ph groups at the two meso&#8208;positions of the macrocycle are examined. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveal a highly bent, nonplanar macrocyclic conformation of the complex resulting in clamp&#8208;shaped molecular structures. Cyclic voltammetry paired with UV&#8208;vis spectroelectrochemistry in PhCN/0.1 M TBAP suggest that the first electron addition correspond to a macrocyclic&#8208;centered reduction while spectral changes observed during the first oxidation are consistent with a metal&#8208;centered CoII/CoIII process. The activity of the clamp&#8208;shaped complexes towards heterogeneous ORR in 0.1 M KOH show selectivity towards the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway giving H2O. DFT first&#8208;principle calculations on the porphyrin catalyst indicates a lower overpotential for 4e&#8208; ORR as compared to the 2e&#8722; pathway, consistent with experimental data.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a synthetic strategy to link titanium&#8208;oxo (Ti&#8208;oxo) clusters into metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) glasses with high porosity though the carboxylate linkage. A new series of MOF glasses were synthesized by evaporation of solution containing Ti&#8208;oxo clusters Ti16O16(OEt)32, linkers, and m&#8208;cresol. The formation of carboxylate linkages between the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and the carboxylate linkers was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy. The structural integrity of the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters within the glasses was evidenced by both X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and 17O magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR. After ligand exchange and activation, the fumarate&#8208;linked MOF glass, termed Ti&#8208;Fum, showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface areas of 923 m2 g&#8208;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Aperture Control Toward Size&#8208;Exclusion&#8208;Based Hydrocarbon Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as a promising material for non&#8208;thermal chemical separations owing to their high structural diversity and tunability. Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc&#8208;based MOF containing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) linker, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, with high thermal stability towards the separation of hexane isomers. The incorporation of the 3D linker enhances the structural stability and provides well&#8208;defined pore apertures/channels with sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom precision. This precision allowed for the separation of similarly sized hexane isomers based on subtle differences in their kinetic diameters. Multi&#8208;component liquid phase batch experiments confirmed the separation of hexanes mixture into linear, monobranched, and dibranched isomers. This work represents a significant milestone in the construction of stable Zn&#8208;based MOFs and the incorporation of 3D linkers as a potential solution to challenging separations.</dc:description>
