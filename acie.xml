         <title>Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; Catalytic Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis operates by stabilizing anionic transition states on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces. In anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis, &#960; stacks add polarizability to strengthen interactions. In search of synthetic methods to extend &#960; stacks beyond the limits of foldamers, the self&#8208;assembly of micelles from amphiphilic naphthalenediimides (NDIs) is introduced. To interface substrates and catalysts, chargetransfer complexes with dialkoxynaphthalenes (DANs), a classic in supramolecular chemistry, are installed. In &#960;&#8208;stacked micelles, the rates of bioinspired ether cyclizations exceed rates on monomers in organic solvents by far. This is particularly impressive considering that anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis in water has been elusive so far. Increasing rates with increasing &#960; acidity of the micelles evince operational anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis. At maximal &#960; acidity, autocatalytic behavior emerges. Dependence on position and order in confined micellar space promises access to emergent properties. Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles in water thus expand supramolecular systems catalysis accessible with anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with an inspiring topic of general interest and great perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 Catalyzed by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benefiting from the excellent structural tunability, robust framework, ultrahigh porosity, and rich active sites, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are widely recognized as promising photocatalysts in chemical conversions, and emerged in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis from 2020. H2O2, serving as an environmental&#8208;friendly oxidant and a promising liquid fuel, has attracted increasing researchers to explore its potential. Over the past few years, numerous COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H2O2 production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H2O2 photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value&#8208;added chemical not limited to H2O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;loss Optical Waveguides through Balancing Deep&#8208;Blue TADF and Orange Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Hybrid Antimony Halide Microstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing the potential of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is crucial for developing light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, sensors, and many others. However, effective strategies in this domain are still relatively scarce. This study presents a new approach to achieving highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF (with a PLQY of 25%) and low&#8208;energy orange RTP (with a PLQY of 90%) through the fabrication of lead&#8208;free hybrid halides. This new class of monomeric and dimeric 0D antimony halides can be facilely synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up solution process, requiring only a few seconds to minutes, which offer exceptional stability and nontoxicity. By leveraging the highly adaptable molecular arrangement and crystal packing modes, the hybrid antimony halides demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into regular 1D microrod and 2D microplate morphologies. This self&#8208;assembly is facilitated by multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the inorganic cores and organic shells. Notably, these microstructures exhibit outstanding polarized luminescence and function as low&#8208;dimensional optical waveguides with remarkably low optical&#8208;loss coefficients. Therefore, this work not only presents a pioneering demonstration of deep&#8208;blue TADF in hybrid antimony halides, but also introduces 1D and 2D micro/nanostructures that hold promising potential for applications in white LEDs and low&#8208;dimensional photonic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Water Transport in UTSA&#8208;280 via a Knock&#8208;off Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water and other small molecules frequently coordinate within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). These coordinated molecules may actively engage in mass transfer, moving together with the transport molecules, but this phenomenon has yet to be examined. In this study, we explore a unique water transfer mechanism in UTSA&#8208;280, where an incoming water molecule can displace a coordinated molecule for mass transfer. We refer to this process as the 'knock&#8208;off' mechanism. Despite UTSA&#8208;280 possessing one&#8208;dimensional channels, the knock&#8208;off transport enables water movement along the other two axes, effectively simulating a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional mass transfer. Even with a relatively narrow pore width, the knock&#8208;off mechanism enables a water flux in the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane. The knock&#8208;off mechanism also renders UTSA&#8208;280 superior water/ethanol diffusion selectivity for pervaporation. To validate this unique mechanism, we conducted 1H and 2H solid&#8208;state NMR on UTSA&#8208;280 after the adsorption of deuterated water. We also derived potential energy diagrams from the density functional theory to gain atomic&#8208;level insight into the knock&#8208;off and the direct&#8208;hopping mechanisms. The simulation findings reveal that the energy barrier of the knock&#8208;off mechanism is marginally lower than the direct&#8208;hopping pathway, implying its potential role in enhancing water diffusion in UTSA&#8208;280.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pair Induced Polar Tri&#8208;layered Perovskite for Record&#8208;Performance Polarized Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulk photovoltaic effect, a promising optoelectronic phenomenon for generating polarized dependent steady&#8208;state photocurrent, has been widely applied in various photodetectors. However, incorporating stereochemically active lone pairs to construct bulk photovoltage in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) is still elusive and challenging. Herein, bulk photovoltage (1.2 V) has been successfully achieved by introducing the stereo&#8208;chemically active lone pairs perovskitizer to construct a polar tri&#8208;layered hybrid perovskite, namely, (IBA)2MHy2Pb3Br10 (1, IBA= iso&#8208;butylamine, MHy = methylhydrazine). Strikingly, owning to the promising bulk photovoltage, 1&#8208;based detectors exhibit an ultra&#8208;highly sensitive polarized photodetection (polarization ratio of up to 24.6) under self&#8208;powered mode. This ratio surpasses all the reported 2D OIHP single&#8208;crystal photodetectors. In addition, detectors exhibit outstanding responsivity (~ 200 mA&#183;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (~ 2.4 &#215; 1013 Jones). More excitingly, further investigation confirms that lone pair electrons in MHy result in the separation of positive and negative charges to produce directional dipoles, which further directional alignment to generate bulk photovoltage, thereby resulting in polarization&#8208;dependent photocurrent. Our findings provide a new demonstration for polar multilayer materials&#8217; construction and may open opportunities for a host of high&#8208;sensitive polarized photodetection.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;Immolation of Hydrogels via Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular organisms possess intricate mechano&#8208;adaptive systems that enable them to sense forces and process them with (bio)chemical circuits for functional adaptation. Inspired by such processes, this study introduces a hydrogel system capable of mechanically activated and chemically transduced self&#8208;destruction. Our judiciously designed hydrogels can mechanically generate radicals that are processed and amplified in a self&#8208;propagating radical de&#8208;crosslinking reaction, ultimately leading to mechanically triggered self&#8208;immolation. We put such systems to work in mechano&#8208;induced debonding, and in a bilayer actuator, where swelling&#8208;induced bending generates sufficient force for selective degradation of one layer, leading to autonomous self&#8208;regulation associated with unbending. Our work helps define design criteria for molecularly controlled adaptive and self&#8208;regulating materials with embodied mechano&#8208;chemical information processing, and showcases their potential for adhesives and soft robotics.</dc:description>

Our judiciously designed hydrogels can mechanically generate radicals that are processed and amplified in a self-propagating radical de-crosslinking reaction, ultimately leading to mechanically triggered self-immolation. We put such systems to work in mechano-induced debonding, and in a bilayer actuator, where swelling-induced bending generates sufficient force for selective degradation of one layer, leading to autonomous self-regulation associated with unbending. Our work helps define design criteria for molecularly controlled adaptive and self-regulating materials with embodied mechano-chemical information processing, and showcases their potential for adhesives and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorinative Bifunctionalization of Aziridines and Azetidines with gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorinative bifunctionalization of aziridines and azetidines was successfully developed via regioselective C&#8208;C and C&#8208;F bond cleavage of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, leading to various &#946;,&#946;'&#8208;bisfluorinated amines and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;bisfluorinated amines. This reaction was achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl group and a fluorine atom scissored from gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane in 100% atom economy for the first time. The mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction underwent amine attacking 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl palladium complex to generate &#951;2&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;allyl aziridine followed by fluoride ligand transfer affording the final &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;fluorinated amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Furan&#8208;Based Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explore a series of furan&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and report their optoelectronic properties, solid&#8208;state packing, photodegradation mechanism and application in photovoltaic devices. Incorporating furan building blocks leads to the expected enhanced backbone planarity, reduced bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of these acceptors. Still, their position in the molecule is critical for stability and device performance. We found that the photodegradation of these acceptors originates from two distinct pathways: electrocyclic photoisomerization and Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition of singlet oxygen. These mechanisms are of general significance to all non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, and the photostability depends strongly and predictably on the molecular structure. Placement of furans next to the acceptor termini offers better photostability, well&#8208;balanced hole/electron transport, and significantly improved device performance. Methylfuran as the linker led to the best photostability and power conversion efficiency (&gt;14%), outperforming all furan&#8208;based acceptors reported to date and all indacenodithiophene&#8208;based acceptors. Our findings show the possibility of photostable furan&#8208;based alternatives to the currently omnipresent thiophene&#8208;based photovoltaic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Reaction Horizons: Evidence of the 5&#8208;Deazaflavin Radical Through Photo&#8208;Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deazaflavins are important analogues of the naturally occurring flavins: riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The use of 5&#8208;deazaflavin as replacement coenzyme in a number of flavoproteins has proven particularly valuable in unraveling and manipulating their reaction mechanisms. It was frequently reported that one&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactions in flavoproteins are impeded with 5&#8208;deazaflavin as cofactor. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the 5&#8208;deazaflavin radical is significantly less stable compared to the respective flavin semiquinone, and quickly re&#8208;oxidizes or undergoes disproportionation. The long&#8208;standing paradigm of 5&#8208;deazaflavin being solely a two&#8208;electron / hydride acceptor / donor &#8211; &#8220;a nicotinamide in flavin clothing&#8221; &#8211; needs now to be reevaluated with the indirect observation of a one&#8208;electron reduced (paramagnetic) species using photo&#8208;chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP)&#160;1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) under biologically relevant conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into&#160;Carbon&#8722;Iodine Bond of Heteroaryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryne insertions into the carbon&#8208;iodine bond of heteroaryl iodides has been achieved for the first time. This novel reaction provides an efficient pathway for the synthesis of valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls from heteroaryl iodides and o&#8208;silylaryl triflates in excellent regioselectivity. The copper(I) catalyst, which bears a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, is essential to accomplish the reaction. Control reactions and DFT calculations indicate that the coordination of copper, as a Lewis acid, with nitrogen atoms of heteroaryl iodides mediates the insertion of arynes into heteroaryl carbon&#8208;iodine&#160;bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzotriazole&#8208;based 3D 4&#8208;Arm Small Molecules Enable 19.1% Efficiency for PM6:Y6&#8208;based Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The third component featuring a planar backbone structure similar to the binary host molecule has been the empirical formula for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we explored a new avenue that introduces 3&#8208;dimensional structured molecules as guest acceptors. Spirobifluorene (SF) is chosen as the core to combine with three different terminal&#8208;modified (rhodanine, thiazolidinedione, and dicyano&#8208;substituted rhodanine) benzotriazole (BTA) units, affording three 4&#8208;arm molecules, SF&#8208;BTA1, SF&#8208;BTA2, and SF&#8208;BTA3, respectively. After adding these three materials into the classical system PM6: Y6, the resulting ternary devices obtained ultra&#8208;high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.1%, 18.7%, and 18.8%, respectively, compared with the binary OSCs (PCE = 17.4%). SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 can work as energy donors to increase charge generation via energy transfer. In addition, the charge transfer between PM6 and SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 also acts to enhance charge generation. Introducing SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 could form acceptor alloys to modify the molecular energy level and inhibit the self&#8208;aggregation of Y6, thereby reducing energy loss and balancing charge transport. Our success in 3D multi&#8208;arm materials as the third component shows good universality and brings a new perspective. The further functional development of multi&#8208;arm materials could make OSCs more stable and efficient.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;metal Ionothermal Synthesis of Metallophthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present efficient synthesis of metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under mixed&#8208;metal ionothermal conditions starting from aryl cyanides. These conjugated COFs followed the Irving&#8211;Williams series in terms of their metal content, surface areas and pore volumes, thus offering a versatile and highly tunable platform to synthesize various COFs, and showed highly competitive CO2 capture and conversion properties.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines (PCs) are intriguing building blocks owing to their stability, physicochemical and catalytic properties. Although PC&#8208;based polymers have been reported before, many suffer from relatively low stability, crystallinity, and low surface areas. Utilizing a mixed&#8208;metal salt ionothermal approach, we report the synthesis of a series of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene and 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetracyanoanthracene to form the corresponding COFs named M&#8208;pPPCs and M&#8208;anPPCs, respectively. The obtained COFs followed the Irving&#8211;Williams series in their metal contents, surface areas, and pore volume and featured excellent CO2 uptake capacities up to 7.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 273&#8197;K, 1.1&#8197;bar. We also investigated the growth of the Co&#8208;pPPC and Co&#8208;anPPC on a highly conductive carbon nanofiber and demonstrated their high catalytic activity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction, which showed Faradaic efficiencies towards CO up to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;0.64&#8197;V vs. RHE.

We also investigated the growth of the Co-pPPC and Co-anPPC on a highly conductive carbon nanofiber and demonstrated their high catalytic activity in the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, which showed Faradaic efficiencies towards CO up to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;0.64&#8197;V vs. RHE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium Promotes Acetylide Formation on MgO During Methane Coupling Under Non&#8208;Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li doping of MgO critically improves selectivity toward C2&#8208;products in non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane. The presence of Li favors the formation of magnesium acetylide and therefore is likely involved in C2 formation.







Abstract
A prototypical material for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is Li/MgO, for which Li is known to be essential as a dopant to obtain high C2 selectivities. Herein, Li/MgO is demonstrated to be an effective catalyst for non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM). Moreover, the presence of Li is shown to favor the formation of magnesium acetylide (MgC2), while pure MgO promotes coke formation as evidenced by solid&#8208;state 13C&#8197;NMR, thus indicating that Li promotes C&#8722;C bond formation. Metadynamic simulations of the carbon mobility in MgC2 and Li2C2 at the density functional theory (DFT) level show that carbon easily diffuses as a C2 unit at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. These insights suggest that the enhanced C2 selectivity for Li&#8208;doped MgO is related to the formation of Li and Mg acetylides.

         <title>Asymmetric Dearomatization of Phenols via Ligand&#8208;Enabled Cooperative Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric dearomatization of phenols was achieved by employing chiral bifunctional phosphine ligands in cooperative gold catalysis. This transformation demonstrated a remarkable generality, affording the desired product with high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivities (ee up to 99&#8201;%).







Abstract
By employing a chiral bifunctional phosphine ligand, a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed efficient and highly enantioselective dearomatization of phenols is achieved via versatile metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. The reaction is proven to be remarkably general in scope, permitting substitutions at all four remaining benzene positions, accommodating electron&#8208;withdrawing groups including strongly deactivating nitro, and allowing carbon&#8208;based groups of varying steric bulk including tert&#8208;butyl at the alkyne terminus. Moreover, besides N&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)alkynamides, the corresponding ynoates and ynones are all suitable substrates. Spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones, spirocyclohexadienone&#8208;butenolides, and spirocyclohexadenone&#8208;cyclopentenones are formed in yields up to 99&#8201;% and with ee up to 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polymethacrylates made by ATRP and RAFT polymerization: High&#8208;Yielding Depolymerization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low temperature and solvent&#8208;free method to depolymerize polymers made by ATRP and RAFT is reported. By performing an efficient end&#8208;group modification, the modified polymers were subsequently successfully depolymerized, resulting in up to 90&#8201;% monomer regeneration at temperatures as low as 220&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the process was scalable and the monomer produced had high purity and could subsequently be used to make a new batch of polymer.







Abstract
Although controlled radical polymerization is an excellent tool to make precision polymeric materials, reversal of the process to retrieve the starting monomer is far less explored despite the significance of chemical recycling. Here, we investigate the bulk depolymerization of RAFT and ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers under identical conditions. RAFT&#8208;synthesized polymers undergo a relatively low&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free depolymerization back to monomer thanks to the partial in situ transformation of the RAFT end&#8208;group to macromonomer. Instead, ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers can only depolymerize at significantly higher temperatures (&gt;350&#8201;&#176;C) through random backbone scission. To aid a more complete depolymerization at even lower temperatures, we performed a facile and quantitative end&#8208;group modification strategy in which both ATRP and RAFT end&#8208;groups were successfully converted to macromonomers. The macromonomers triggered a lower temperature bulk depolymerization with an onset at 150&#8201;&#176;C yielding up to 90&#8201;% of monomer regeneration. The versatility of the methodology was demonstrated by a scalable depolymerization (&#8776;10&#8197;g of starting polymer) retrieving 84&#8201;% of the starting monomer intact which could be subsequently used for further polymerization. This work presents a new low&#8208;energy approach for depolymerizing controlled radical polymers and creates many future opportunities as high&#8208;yielding, solvent&#8208;free and scalable depolymerization methods are sought.

         <title>An Inorganic Click Reaction for the Synthesis of Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative inorganic click reaction that proceeds in solution in the absence of a catalyst has been used as a stoppering strategy for the synthesis of interlocked molecules in good yields (ca. 65&#8201;%). The resulting organometallic rotaxanes are air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable and can be purified by column chromatography under aerobic conditions.







Abstract
We describe the use of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of a new class of inorganic rotaxanes containing gold(I) triazaphosphole stoppers. Electron&#8208;deficient bis&#8208;azides, which thread perethylated pillar[5]arene in aromatic solvents, readily react with two equivalents of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to afford interlocked molecules via an inorganic click reaction. These transformations proceed in good yields (ca. 65&#8201;%) and in the absence of a catalyst. The resulting organometallic rotaxanes are air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable and can be purified by column chromatography under aerobic conditions. The targeted rotaxanes were characterized by multi&#8208;element nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass&#8208;spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>A Rapid Sputum&#8208;based Lateral Flow Assay for Airway Eosinophilia using an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme Selected for Eosinophil Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive and specific lateral flow assay for eosinophil peroxidase using a new protein&#8208;activated RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme can detect the protein in patient sputum with a total assay time of 40&#8197;min to diagnose eosinophilic airway disease.







Abstract
The first protein&#8208;binding allosteric RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme (RCD) obtained by direct in vitro selection against eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), a validated marker for airway eosinophilia, is described. The RCD has nanomolar affinity for EPX, shows high selectivity against related peroxidases and other eosinophil proteins, and is resistant to degradation by mammalian nucleases. An optimized RCD was used to develop both fluorescence and lateral flow assays, which were evaluated using 38&#8197;minimally processed patient sputum samples (23&#8197;non&#8208;eosinophilic, 15&#8197;eosinophilic), producing a clinical sensitivity of 100&#8201;% and specificity of 96&#8201;%. This RCD&#8208;based lateral flow assay should allow for rapid evaluation of airway eosinophilia as an aid for guiding asthma therapy.

         <title>Integrated Photochromic&#8208;Photothermal Processes for Catalytic Plastic Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We surpass the limitation of the existing photothermal catalysis mechanism and propose a photochromic&#8208;photothermal catalytic system based on polyol&#8208;ligated TiO2 nanocrystals. Upon sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. This process boosts photothermal efficiency and facilitates polyester glycolysis efficiency.







Abstract
Incorporating high&#8208;energy ultraviolet (UV) photons into photothermal catalytic processes may enable photothermal&#8208;photochemical synergistic catalysis, which represents a transformative technology for waste plastic recycling. The major challenge is avoiding side reactions and by&#8208;products caused by these energetic photons. Here, we break through the limitation of the existing photothermal conversion mechanism and propose a photochromic&#8208;photothermal catalytic system based on polyol&#8208;ligated TiO2 nanocrystals. Upon UV or sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols can rapidly capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. The resulting abundant defect energy levels boost sunlight&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, and simultaneously the oxygen vacancies facilitate polyester glycolysis by activating the nucleophilic addition&#8208;elimination process. As a result, compared to commercial TiO2 (P25), we achieve 6&#8208;fold and 12.2&#8208;fold performance enhancements under thermal and photothermal conditions, respectively, while maintaining high selectivity to high&#8208;valued monomers. This paradigm&#8208;shift strategy directs energetic UV photons for activating catalysts and avoids their interaction with reactants, opening the possibility of substantially elevating the efficiency of more solar&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of Fluorophores from a &#8220;Flex&#8208;activated&#8221; Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical force probes that can release force&#8208;dependent and visualized signals with minimal changes in the polymer main chains under mechanical load are highly sought after but currently limited. In this study, we introduce a flex&#8208;activated mechanophore (FA) based on the Diels&#8208;Alder adduct of anthracene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylatea that exhibits turn&#8208;on mechanofluorescence. We demonstrate that when FA is incorporated into polymer networks or in its crystalline state, it can release fluorescent anthracenes through a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder mechanochemical reaction under compression or hydrostatic high pressure, respectively. The flex&#8208;activated mechanism of FA is successfully confirmed. Furthermore, we systematically modulate the force delivered to the mechanophore by varying the crosslinking density of the networks and the applied macroscopic pressures. This modulation leads to incremental increases in mechanophore activation, successive release of anthracenes, and quantitative enhancement of fluorescence intensity. The exceptional potential of FA as a sensitive force probe in different bulk states is highlighted, benefiting from its unique flex&#8208;activated mode with highly emissive fluorophore releasing. Overall, this report enriches our understanding of the structures and functions of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores and polymeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Regulate Silver&#8208;Copper Bimetallic Oxide Nanowires for Highly Selective Photoreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective photoreduction of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons is of great importance to achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Precisely manipulating the formation of the Metal1&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;Metal2 (M1&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;M2) intermediate on the photocatalyst interface is the most critical step for regulating selectivity, while is still a significant challenge. Herein, inspired by the polar electronic structure feature of CO2 molecule, we propose a strategy that the Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites confined in bimetallic catalyst surface are conducive to forming M1&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;M2 intermediate precisely, which can promote the selectivity for hydrocarbon formation. Employing the Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires with abundant Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the preferred exposed {110} surface as a model catalyst, 100% selectivity toward photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 has been achieved. Subsequential surface quenching experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites do play a vital role in regulating the M1&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;M2 intermediate formation that is considered to be prone to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons. This study reports a highly selective CO2 photocatalyst designed based on the newly proposed theory toward precise reaction intermediates regulation, which could stimulate the research on dual&#8208;site catalyst design for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Interfacial Reactions through Regulating p&#8208;Band Centers by an Indium Tin Oxide Protective Layer for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic zinc (Zn) is considered as one of the most attractive anode materials for the post&#8208;lithium metal battery systems owing to the high theoretical capacity, low cost, and intrinsic safety. However, the Zn dendrites and parasitic side reaction impede its application. Herein, we propose a new principle of regulating p&#8208;band center of metal oxide protective coating to balance Zn adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for effective Zn deposition and stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that benefiting from the uniform zincophilic nucleation sites and fast Zn transport on indium tin oxide (ITO), highly stable and reversible Zn anode can be achieved. As a result, the I&#8208;Zn symmetrical cell achieves highly reversible Zn deposition/stripping with an extremely low overpotential of 9 mV and a superior lifespan over 4000 h. The Cu/I&#8208;Zn asymmetrical cell exhibits a long lifetime of over 4000 cycles with high average coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. Furthermore, the assembled I&#8208;Zn/AC full cell exhibits an excellent lifetime for 70000 cycles with nearly 100% capacity retention. This work provides a general strategy and new insight for the construction of efficient Zn anode protection layer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Highly Selective Separation of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene</title>

         <dc:description>The separation of&#160;acetylene&#160;(C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a very important but challenging task due to their similar molecular dimensions and physical properties. In terms of porous adsorbents for this separation, the CO2&#8208;selective porous materials are superior to the C2H2&#8208;selective ones because of the cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiency but have been rarely achieved. Herein we report our unexpected discovery of the first hydrogen bonded organic framework (HOF) constructed from a simple organic linker&#160;2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine&#160;(PYTPZ) (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88) as the highly CO2&#8208;selective&#160;porous&#160;material. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 is a two&#8208;dimensional HOF with a pore pocket of about 7.6 &#197;.&#160;The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88&#160;takes up a high amount of CO2&#160;(59.6 cm&#179; g&#8315;&#185;) at ambient conditions with the record IAST selectivity of 1894. Its high performance for the CO2/C2H2&#160;separation has been further confirmed through breakthrough experiments,&#160;in&#8208;situdiffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and molecular simulations.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the efficient separation of pX from its ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208; isomers by a microporous calcium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework material (HIAM&#8208;203) with a flexible skeleton. At 30 &#176;C, all three isomers are accommodated but the adsorption kinetics of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX) are substantially slower than that of pX, and at an elevated temperature of 120 &#176;C, oX and mX are fully excluded while pX can be adsorbed. Multicomponent column breakthrough measurements and vapor&#8208;phase/liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments have demonstrated the capability of HIAM&#8208;203 for efficient separation of xylene isomers.

         <title>Anion&#8208;tethered Single Lithium&#8208;ion Conducting Polyelectrolytes through UV&#8208;induced Free Radical Polymerization for Improved Morphological Stability of Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion transport kinetics, Li0 deposition behavior, and electrochemical performances of a dual&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte and a single&#8208;ion conducting polyelectrolyte (SIC) were investigated. The SIC electrolyte showed improved Li+ transference number (0.85), uniform Li0 morphology, enhanced critical current density (2.4&#8197;mA/cm2), and durability of 4500 cycles in Li0&#8208;LiFePO4 battery.







Abstract
Single Li+ ion conducting polyelectrolytes (SICs), which feature covalently tethered counter&#8208;anions along their backbone, have the potential to mitigate dendrite formation by reducing concentration polarization and preventing salt depletion. However, due to their low ionic conductivity and complicated synthetic procedure, the successful validation of these claimed advantages in lithium metal (Li0) anode batteries remains limited. In this study, we fabricated a SIC electrolyte using a single&#8208;step UV polymerization approach. The resulting electrolyte exhibited a high Li+ transference number (t+) of 0.85 and demonstrated good Li+ conductivity (6.3&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S/cm at room temperature), which is comparable to that of a benchmark dual ion conductor (DIC, 9.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S/cm). Benefitting from the high transference number of SIC, it displayed a three&#8208;fold higher critical current density (2.4&#8197;mA/cm2) compared to DIC (0.8&#8197;mA/cm2) by successfully suppressing concentration polarization&#8208;induced short&#8208;circuiting. Additionally, the t+ significantly influenced the deposition behavior of Li0, with SIC yielding a uniform, compact, and mosaic&#8208;like morphology, while the low t+ DIC resulted in a porous morphology with Li0 whiskers. Using the SIC electrolyte, Li0||LiFePO4 cells exhibited stable operation for 4500 cycles with 70.5&#8201;% capacity retention at 22&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Low Ruthenium Content Confined on Boron Carbon Nitride as an Efficient and Stable Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru nanoparticles immobilized on a stable boron carbon nitride (BCN) nanosheet support show excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability. The coordination of introduced B and active N sites in BCN provides strong interaction between the Ru and the support, which facilitates Ru dispersity and promotes the catalyst's stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the BCN support can reduce the OER energy barrier and change the adsorption capacity for intermediate products.







Abstract
To date, only a few noble metal oxides exhibit the required efficiency and stability as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under the acidic, high&#8208;voltage conditions that exist during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). The high cost and scarcity of these catalysts hinder the large&#8208;scale application of PEMWE. Here, we report a novel OER electrocatalyst for OER comprised of uniformly dispersed Ru clusters confined on boron carbon nitride (BCN) support. Compared to RuO2, our BCN&#8208;supported catalyst shows enhanced charge transfer. It displays a low overpotential of 164&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, suggesting its excellent OER catalytic activity. This catalyst was able to operate continuously for over 12&#8197;h under acidic conditions, whereas RuO2 without any support fails in 1&#8197;h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the interaction between the N on BCN support and Ru clusters changes the adsorption capacity and reduces the OER energy barrier, which increases the electrocatalytic activity of Ru.

         <title>Using Aggregation to Chaperone Nanoparticles Across Fluid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capitalizing on the aggregation of NPs induces an unusual &#8220;single particle&#8208;aggregation&#8208;single particle&#8221; transfer process, which can be established through either ligand&#8208;exchange processes or electrostatic interactions. By introducing a jammed NP&#8208;polymer assembled layer at the liquid/liquid interface (LLI), the transfer process can be suppressed, opening a new strategy to manipulate the dispersion of nanoparticles in various liquid media.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) transfer is usually induced by adding ligands to modify NP surfaces, but aggregation of NPs oftentimes hampers the transfer. Here, we show that aggregation during NP phase transfer does not necessarily result in transfer failure. Using a model system comprising gold NPs and amphiphilic polymers, we demonstrate an unusual mechanism by which NPs can undergo phase transfer from the aqueous phase to the organic phase via a single&#8208;aggregation&#8208;single pathway. Our discovery challenges the conventional idea that aggregation inhibits NP transfer and provides an unexpected pathway for transferring larger&#8208;sized NPs (&gt;20&#8197;nm). The charged amphiphilic polymers effectively act as chaperons for the NP transfer and offer a unique way to manipulate the dispersion and distribution of NPs in two immiscible liquids. Moreover, by intentionally jamming the NP&#8208;polymer assembly at the liquid/liquid interface, the transfer process can be inhibited.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Borylcyclopropanation of Alkenes with a (Diborylmethyl)iodide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, multifunctional (diboronmethyl)iodide reagent (CH(Bpin)2I) was synthesized for the photoinduced cyclopropanation of alkenes, providing an array of 1,2&#8208;substituted cyclopropylboronates. The transformation exhibits operational simplicity, broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and practicality for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.







Abstract
Cyclopropane skeletons play a prominent role in the development of organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a stable, multifunctional (diborylmethyl)iodide reagent (CHI(Bpin)2) for the photoinduced cyclopropanation of alkenes, providing an array of 1,2&#8208;substituted cyclopropylboronates in good yields. This &#945;&#8208;haloboronic ester can be readily synthesized on a multigram scale from commercially available starting materials. Furthermore, the protocol displays high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and allows for late&#8208;stage borylcyclopropanation of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the borylcyclopropanation proceeds through a radical addition/polar cyclization pathway mediated by the photocatalyst fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 and visible light.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Bromination, Chlorination and Thiocyanation Using Inorganic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative halogenation typically requires stoichiometric strong oxidants or electrophilic halogenating agents. It is now shown that simple inorganic halide salts can be used for halogenation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide&#8208;activated carboxylic acids under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Halodecarboxylation proceeded with LiBr and LiCl, and the generality of the conditions was demonstrated by extension to decarboxylative thiocyanation with KSCN.







Abstract
Decarboxylative halogenation reactions of alkyl carboxylic acids are highly valuable reactions for the synthesis of structurally diverse alkyl halides. However, many reported protocols rely on stoichiometric strong oxidants or highly electrophilic halogenating agents. Herein, we describe visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative halogenation reactions of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide&#8208;activated carboxylic acids that avoid stoichiometric oxidants and use inexpensive inorganic halide salts as the halogenating agents. Bromination with lithium bromide proceeds under simple, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions using an organic photoredox catalyst and no other additives, whereas dual photoredox&#8208;copper catalysis is required for chlorination with lithium chloride. The mild conditions display excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, which is demonstrated through the transformation of a diverse range of structurally complex carboxylic acid containing natural products into the corresponding alkyl bromides and chlorides. In addition, we show the generality of the dual photoredox&#8208;copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalization with inorganic salts by extension to thiocyanation with potassium thiocyanide, which was applied to the synthesis of complex alkyl thiocyanates.

     alt="Photoredox-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Bromination, Chlorination and Thiocyanation Using Inorganic Salts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decarboxylative halogenation typically requires stoichiometric strong oxidants or electrophilic halogenating agents. It is now shown that simple inorganic halide salts can be used for halogenation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide-activated carboxylic acids under visible-light photoredox catalysis. Halodecarboxylation proceeded with LiBr and LiCl, and the generality of the conditions was demonstrated by extension to decarboxylative thiocyanation with KSCN.

         <title>Access to Trifluoromethylketones from Alkyl Bromides and Trifluoroacetic Anhydride by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methods for direct access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones from feedstocks remain underdeveloped, partially owing to the high reactivity and instability of the trifluoroacetyl radical. Reported herein is the photocatalytic synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones from alkyl bromides and trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction features visible&#8208;light catalysis and halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT), followed by an enabling radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of the alkyl radical with a stabilized trifluoroacetyl radical.







Abstract
Aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones are a type of unique fluorine&#8208;containing subunit which play a significant role in altering the physical and biological properties of molecules. Catalytic methods to provide direct access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones are highly desirable yet remain underdeveloped, partially owing to the high reactivity and instability of trifluoroacetyl radical. Herein, we report a photocatalytic synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones from alkyl bromides with trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction features dual visible&#8208;light and halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysis, followed by an enabling radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of an alkyl radical with a stabilized trifluoromethyl radical. The reaction provides straightforward access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones from readily available and cost&#8208;effective alkyl halides and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA).

         <title>Accelerated Microbial Corrosion by Magnetite and Electrically Conductive Pili through Direct Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;Microbe Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically conductive pili (e&#8208;pili) and magnetite facilitate Geobacter sulfurreducens electron uptake from metallic iron. The complex interactions between e&#8208;pili, cytochromes, and magnetite are actively researched in electrobiocorrosion. Magnetite, a common corrosion product, enhances electrobiocorrosion through a positive feedback loop. It reduces the need for cells to create electrical contacts, leading to high corrosion rate.







Abstract
Electrobiocorrosion, the process in which microbes extract electrons from metallic iron (Fe0) through direct Fe0&#8208;microbe electrical connections, is thought to contribute to the costly corrosion of iron&#8208;containing metals that impacts many industries. However, electrobiocorrosion mechanisms are poorly understood. We report here that electrically conductive pili (e&#8208;pili) and the conductive mineral magnetite play an important role in the electron transfer between Fe0 and Geobacter sulfurreducens, the first microbe in which electrobiocorrosion has been rigorously documented. Genetic modification to express poorly conductive pili substantially diminished corrosive pitting and rates of Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;microbe electron flux. Magnetite reduced resistance to electron transfer, increasing corrosion currents and intensifying pitting. Studies with mutants suggested that the magnetite promoted electron transfer in a manner similar to the outer&#8208;surface c&#8208;type cytochrome OmcS. These findings, and the fact that magnetite is a common product of iron corrosion, suggest a potential positive feedback loop of magnetite produced during corrosion further accelerating electrobiocorrosion. The interactions of e&#8208;pili, cytochromes, and magnetite demonstrate mechanistic complexities of electrobiocorrosion, but also provide insights into detecting and possibly mitigating this economically damaging process.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Vesicle Signal Transduction Using a Photo&#8208;Responsive Zinc Ionophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic inter&#8208;vesicle signalling system is reported in which diffusible chemical signals trigger transmembrane ion transport. Photo&#8208;activation of caged ZnII transporters triggers their release from one population of vesicles and the activation of transport in another remote population of vesicles leading to overall inter&#8208;vesicle signal transduction and amplification.







Abstract
Transmission of chemical information between cells and across lipid bilayer membranes is of profound significance in many biological processes. The design of synthetic signalling systems is a critical step towards preparing artificial cells with collective behaviour. Here, we report the first example of a synthetic inter&#8208;vesicle signalling system, in which diffusible chemical signals trigger transmembrane ion transport in a manner reminiscent of signalling pathways in biology. The system is derived from novel ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl and BODIPY photo&#8208;caged ZnII transporters, in which cation transport is triggered by photo&#8208;decaging with UV or red light, respectively. This decaging reaction can be used to trigger the release of the cationophores from a small population of sender vesicles. This in turn triggers the transport of ions across the membrane of a larger population of receiver vesicles, but not across the sender vesicle membrane, leading to overall inter&#8208;vesicle signal transduction and amplification.

New heterocyclic diradicaloids based on boron and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic systems with open&#8208;shell ground&#8208;states are obtained via concomitant structural and quinoidal extensions, thus allowing to merge the best of both design strategies. A combination of experimental characterization and theoretical calculations have helped disclose their electronic structure, as well as rationalize their associated magnetic and photophysical properties, spanning the chemical space of available molecular templates for cutting&#8208;edge applications in organic electronics and spintronics.

         <title>Alignment and Dynamic Inversion of Planar Chirality in Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[n]arenes are unique cylindrical macrocycles in which the planar chirality of their &#960;&#8208;units can be inverted through unit flipping but prefers to be aligned. This Minireview describes how these features have led to the development of chiroptical molecules, dynamic chirality alignment phenomena in tubular assemblies of pillar[n]arenes, and environment&#8208;responsive chiral outputs in diastereomeric systems with additional chiral sources.







Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are symmetrical macrocyclic compounds composed of benzene panels with para&#8208;methylene linkages. Each panel usually exhibits planar chirality and prefers chirality&#8208;aligned states. Because of this feature, pillar[n]arenes are attractive scaffolds for chiroptical materials that are easy to prepare and optically resolve and show intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. In addition, rotation of the panels endows the chirality of pillar[n]arenes with a dynamic nature. The chirality in tubular oligomers and supramolecular assemblies sometimes show time&#8208; and procedure&#8208;dependent alignment phenomena. Furthermore, the CD signals of some pillar[n]arenes respond to the addition of chiral guests when their dynamic chirality is coupled with host&#8211;guest properties. By using diastereomeric pillar[n]arenes with additional chiral structures, the response can also be caused by achiral guests and changes of the environment, providing molecular sensors.

         <title>Strong Inhibition of Ice Growth by Biomimetic Crowding Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimetic the membrane&#8208;less organelles inside cells, we fabricated coacervates consisting of various components. It is firstly discovered that the crowding coacervates exhibit strong ice growth inhibition activity. It opens a completely new avenue to design ice&#8208;controlling materials for the cryopreservation of biological samples and may provide new insights into the survival of freezing&#8208;tolerant organisms.







Abstract
The freezing of biological fluids is intensively studied but remains elusive as it is affected not only by the various components but also by the crowding nature of the biological fluids. Herein, we constructed spherical crowders, fibrous crowders, and coacervates by various components ranging from surfactants to polymers and proteins, to mimic three typical crowders in biological fluids, i.e., globular proteins, fibrous networks, and condensates of biomolecules. It is elucidated that the three crowders exhibit low, moderate, and strong ice growth inhibition activity, respectively, resulting from their different abilities in slowing down water dynamics. Intriguingly, the coacervate consisting of molecules without obvious ice growth inhibition activity strongly inhibits ice growth, which is firstly employed as a highly&#8208;potent cryoprotectant. This work provides new insights into the survival of freezing&#8208;tolerant organisms and opens an avenue for the design of ice&#8208;controlling materials.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Imaging of Nascent DNA in Live Cells by Monitoring the Fluorescence Lifetime of DNA&#8208;Incorporated Thiazole Orange&#8208;Modified Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) nucleotide&#160;modified with a thiazole orange moiety shows different fluorescence lifetimes in living cells depending on whether it is present as a free triphosphate or as a DNA&#8208;incorporated nucleotide. Due to this unique property, DNA synthesis in live cells can be monitored in real time using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.







Abstract
A modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate derivative (dCTOTP) bearing a thiazole orange moiety tethered via an oligoethylene glycol linker was designed and synthesized. The nucleotide was incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerases in vitro as well as in live cells. Upon incorporation of dCTOTP into DNA, the thiazole orange moiety exhibited a fluorescence lifetime that differed significantly from the non&#8208;incorporated (i.e. free and non&#8208;covalently intercalated) forms of dCTOTP. When dCTOTP was delivered into live U&#8208;2 OS cells using a synthetic nucleoside triphosphate transporter, it allowed us to distinguish and monitor cells that were actively synthesizing DNA in real time, from the very first moments after the treatment. We anticipate that this probe could be used to study chromatin organization and dynamics.

Hydrolytically degradable block copolymer nanoparticles are prepared via reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in aqueous media. This efficient protocol involves the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMAC) using a monofunctional or bifunctional trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) precursor. DMAC monomer is employed as a co&#8208;solvent to solubilize the hydrophobic PCL chains. At an intermediate DMAC conversion of 20&#8211;60&#8201;%, the reaction mixture is diluted with water to 10&#8211;25&#8201;%&#8201;w/w solids. The growing amphiphilic block copolymer chains undergo nucleation to form sterically&#8208;stabilized PCL&#8208;core nanoparticles with PDMAC coronas. 1H&#8197;NMR studies confirm more than 99&#8201;% DMAC conversion while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) studies indicate well&#8208;controlled RAFT polymerizations (Mw/Mn&#8804;1.30). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicate spheres of 20&#8211;120&#8197;nm diameter. As expected, hydrolytic degradation occurs within days at 37&#8201;&#176;C in either acidic or alkaline solution. Degradation is also observed in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) (pH&#8197;7.4) at 37&#8201;&#176;C. However, no degradation is detected over a three&#8208;month period when these nanoparticles are stored at 20&#8201;&#176;C in deionized water (pH&#8197;6.7). Finally, PDMAC30&#8208;PCL16&#8208;PDMAC30 nanoparticles are briefly evaluated as a dispersant for an agrochemical formulation based on a broad&#8208;spectrum fungicide (azoxystrobin).

Amplification of asymmetry is achieved using a mixture of ATP and achiral pyrophosphate (PPi) guests, whereas the high luminescence is ensured by the aggregation&#8208;induced emissive nature of the monomers.







Abstract
Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from purely organic molecules holds great promise for applications in displays, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high dissymmetry values (glum) from organic chromophores remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a bioinspired approach using adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;triggered supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene diimide&#8208;derived monomer (ANSG) to induce CPL with a remarkable glum value of 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2. The ANSG molecules undergo a templated, chiral self&#8208;assembly through a cooperative growth mechanism in the presence of ATP, resulting in scrolled nanotubes with aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) and induced CPL. Furthermore, we demonstrate the concept of chiroptical amplification of induced CPL by efficiently amplifying asymmetry using a mixture of chiral ATP and achiral pyrophosphate. This innovative approach opens numerous opportunities in the emerging field of circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Communication Along a Scaffolded Nanoscale Array of Squaramides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two nanometer&#8208;long molecular device has been synthesised that contains a rigid rod &#8208; to provide structural definition &#8208; attached to a molecular relay that switches direction in response to an incoming signal. Like natural systems, it responds to temporal changes in a signal, exemplified by the consumption of a molecular fuel, changes that are transmitted down the device.







Abstract
Relaying conformational change over several nanometers is central to the function of allosterically regulated proteins. Replicating this mechanism artificially would provide important communication tools, but requires nanometer&#8208;sized molecules that reversibly switch between defined shapes in response to signaling molecules. In this work, 1.8&#8197;nm long rigid rod oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene)s are scaffolds for switchable multi&#8208;squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bond relays. Each relay can adopt either a parallel or an antiparallel orientation relative to the scaffold; the preferred orientation is dictated by a director group at one end. An amine director responded to proton signals, with acid&#8208;base cycles producing multiple reversible changes in relay orientation that were reported by a terminal NH, which is 1.8&#8197;nm distant. Moreover, a chemical fuel acted as a dissipative signal. As the fuel was consumed, the relay reverted to its original orientation, illustrating how information from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium molecular signals can be communicated to a distant site.

An I(I)/I(III) catalysis&#8208;based strategy to access 8&#8208;membered carbocycles via the direct carbofunctionalization of 2&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes is disclosed. This strategy to generate densely functionalized, fluorinated benzocyclooctenes is modular and through changes in the oxidation/activation regime and the external nucleophile, the challenging cyclization can be merged with formation of allylic C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;C bonds (&gt;30 examples).







Abstract
A main&#8208;group catalysis&#8208;based strategy to access 8&#8208;membered carbocycles via the direct carbofunctionalization of 2&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes is disclosed. Through the intervention of an I(I)/I(III) catalysis cycle, the synthesis of densely functionalized, fluorinated benzocyclooctenes can be achieved in an operationally simple manner. Modulating the oxidation/activation regime, and the external nucleophile, the process has been extended to unify the challenging cyclization with formation of allylic C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;C bonds (&gt;30 examples). Derivatization of the product benzocyclooctenes is demonstrated together with X&#8208;ray conformational analysis, preliminary validation of enantioselective catalysis and a scalable resolution protocol.

         <title>Modulating Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coupling in Anti&#8208;Perovskite Nitride via Cation Doping for Efficient Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the metal&#8208;nitrogen coupling in anti&#8208;perovskite Co4N can be effective modulated by Cu doping, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation process during electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia.







Abstract
The complexes of metal center and nitrogen ligands are the most representative systems for catalyzing hydrogenation reactions in small molecule conversion. Developing heterogeneous catalysts with similar active metal&#8208;nitrogen functional centers, nevertheless, still remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that the metal&#8208;nitrogen coupling in anti&#8208;perovskite Co4N can be effective modulated by Cu doping to form Co3CuN, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation process during electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia. The combination of advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that Cu dopants strengthen the Co&#8722;N bond and upshifted the metal d&#8208;band towards the Fermi level, promoting the adsorption of NO3&#8722; and *H and facilitating the transition from *NO2/*NO to *NO2H/*NOH. Consequently, the Co3CuN delivers noticeably better NO3&#8722;RR activity than the pristine Co4N, with optimal Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and ammonia yield of 455.3&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance heterogeneous catalyst for electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Modular Functionalization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Nitrogen Recovery from Fresh Urine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen recovery from wastewater represents a sustainable route to recycle reactive nitrogen (Nr). It can reduce the demand of producing Nr from the energy&#8208;extensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process and lower the risk of causing eutrophication simultaneously. In this aspect, source&#8208;separated fresh urine is an ideal source for nitrogen recovery given its ubiquity and high nitrogen contents. However, current techniques for nitrogen recovery from fresh urine require high energy input and are of low efficiencies because the recovery target, urea, is a challenge to separate. In this work, we developed a novel fresh urine nitrogen recovery treatment process based on modular functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, we employed three distinct modification methods to MOF&#8208;808 and developed robust functional materials for urea hydrolysis, ammonium adsorption, and ammonia monitoring. By integrating these functional materials into our newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process, we achieved an average of 75% total nitrogen reduction and 45% nitrogen recovery with a 30 minutes treatment of synthetic fresh urine. The nitrogen recovery process developed in this work can serve as a sustainable and efficient nutrient management that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment. This work also provides a new perspective of implementing versatile advanced materials for water and wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional cyanine dyes with a symmetric structure are "always&#8208;on", which can easily accumulate in the liver and display high liver background fluorescence, inevitably interfering the accurate diagnosis and therapy in extrahepatic diseases. We herein report a platform of NIR&#8208;II non&#8208;symmetric cyanine (NSCyanine) dyes by harnessing a non&#8208;symmetric strategy, which are extremely sensitive to pH/viscosity and can be activated via a&#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221;strategy. These NSCyanine dyes with a low pKa (&lt;4.0) only show weak fluorescence at lysosome pH (key1), however, the fluorescence can be completely switched on and significantly enhanced by intracellular viscosity (key2) in disease tissues, exhibiting high target&#8208;to&#8208;liver ratios up to 19.5/1. Notably, high&#8208;contrast phototheranostics in extrahepatic diseases are achieved, including intestinal metastasis&#8208;imaging, acute gastritis&#8208;imaging, bacteria infected wound healing, and tumor ablation via targeted combined photothermal therapy and chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Amides by a Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Wolff Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective addition of potent nucleophiles to ketenes poses challenges due to competing background reactions and poor stereocontrol. Herein, we present a method for enantioselective phosphoric acid catalyzed amination of ketenes generated from &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones. Upon exposure to visible light, the diazoketones undergo Wolff rearrangement to generate ketenes. The phosphoric acid not only accelerates ketene capture by amines to form a single configuration of aminoenol intermediates but also promotes an enantioselective proton&#8208;transfer reaction of the intermediates to yield the products. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway and explained how the catalyst expedited the transformation and controlled the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Radical Borylation of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Without Light by Using Cumulene&#8208;Based Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) plays a critical role in many chemical processes, from organic synthesis to environmental remediation. However, the selective reduction of inert substrates (Ep/2 &lt; &#8722;2 V vs Fc/Fc+), such as ubiquitous electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich (hetero)aryl chlorides, remains a major challenge. Current approaches largely rely on catalyst photoexcitation to reach the necessary deeply reducing potentials or suffer from limited substrate scopes. Herein, we demonstrate that cumulenes&#8212;organic molecules with multiple consecutive double bonds&#8212;can function as catalytic redox mediators for the electroreductive radical borylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides at relatively mild cathodic potentials (approximately &#8722;1.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) without the need for photoirradiation. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies support that step&#8208;wise electron transfer from reduced cumulenes to electron&#8208;neutral chloroarenes is followed by thermodynamically favorable mesolytic cleavage of the aryl radical anion to generate the desired aryl radical intermediate. Our findings will guide the development of other sustainable, purely electroreductive radical transformations of inert molecules using organic redox mediators.</dc:description>

         <title>A TriPPPro&#8208;Nucleotide Reporter with Optimized Cell&#8208;Permeable Dyes for Metabolic Labeling of Cellular and Viral DNA in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TriPPPro approach facilitates live&#8208;cell imaging of metabolically labeled cellular and viral DNA. The pronucleotide of a modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate allows the incorporation of the fast bioorthogonal 2TCOa label belonging to the iEDDA repertoire. Subsequent staining of the tagged DNA with highly reactive dye&#8208;tetrazine conjugates within minutes to hours after dye addition enables the visualization of nucleic acids in real time.







Abstract
The metabolic labeling of nucleic acids in living cells is highly desirable to track the dynamics of nucleic acid metabolism in real&#8208;time and has the potential to provide novel insights into cellular biology as well as pathogen&#8208;host interactions. Catalyst&#8208;free inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions (iEDDA) with nucleosides carrying highly reactive moieties such as axial 2&#8208;trans&#8208;cyclooctene (2TCOa) would be an ideal tool to allow intracellular labeling of DNA. However, cellular kinase phosphorylation of the modified nucleosides is needed after cellular uptake as triphosphates are not membrane permeable. Unfortunately, the narrow substrate window of most endogenous kinases limits the use of highly reactive moieties. Here, we apply our TriPPPro (triphosphate pronucleotide) approach to directly deliver a highly reactive 2TCOa&#8208;modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine triphosphate reporter into living cells. We show that this nucleoside triphosphate is metabolically incorporated into de novo synthesized cellular and viral DNA and can be labeled with highly reactive and cell&#8208;permeable fluorescent dye&#8208;tetrazine conjugates via iEDDA to visualize DNA in living cells directly. Thus, we present the first comprehensive method for live&#8208;cell imaging of cellular and viral nucleic acids using a two&#8208;step labeling approach.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Radius&#8208;Controlled Sn&#8722;O Bond Length Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling Sn&#8722;O bond length via A&#8208;site cation radius of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides was a reliable strategy to boost their CO2 electroreduction properties. With Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it was demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.

Despite the intriguing potential shown by Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the rational optimization of their CO2RR properties is still lacking. Here we report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples of Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3, as the A&#8208;site cation average radii decrease from 1.61 to 1.44&#8197;&#197;, their Sn&#8722;O bonds are precisely shortened from 2.06 to 2.02&#8197;&#197;. Our CO2RR measurements show that the activity and selectivity of these samples for HCOOH production exhibit volcano&#8208;type trends with the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. Among these samples, the Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3 features the optimal activity (753.6&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (90.9&#8201;%) for HCOOH, better than those of the reported Sn&#8208;based oxides. Such optimized CO2RR properties could be attributed to favorable merits conferred by the precisely controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, e.g., the regulated band center, modulated adsorption/activation of intermediates, and reduced energy barrier for *OCHO formation. This work brings a new avenue for rational design of advanced Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides toward CO2RR.

&lt;p&gt;Precisely controlling Sn&#8722;O bond length via A-site cation radius of Sn-based perovskite oxides was a reliable strategy to boost their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction properties.

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Reactivity of Borocarbonitride in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suitable amount of carbon in h&#8208;BN catalyst effectively inhibits the excessive oxidation of BCN in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Density functional theory calculations show that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can affect the electronic microenvironment of h&#8208;BN to render a superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Borocarbonitride (BCN) materials are newly developed oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes. However, BCN materials tend to form bulky B2O3 due to over&#8208;oxidation at the high reaction temperature, resulting in significant deactivation. Here, we report a series of super stable BCN nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance of the BCN nanosheets can be easily regulated by changing the guanine dosage. The control experiment and structural characterization indicate that the introduction of a suitable amount of carbon could prevent the formation of excessive B2O3 from BCN materials and maintain the 2D skeleton at a high temperature of 520&#8201;&#176;C. The best&#8208;performing catalyst BCN exhibits 81.9&#8201;% selectivity towards olefins with a stable propane conversion of 35.8&#8201;%, and the propene productivity reaches 16.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much better than hexagonal BN (h&#8208;BN) catalysts. Density functional theory calculation results show that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can significantly affect the electronic microenvironment of h&#8208;BN, thereby boosting the catalytic activity of BCN.

         <title>Facile Borylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, Imines, Arenes and Heteroarenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Boranes and a Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>Although the development of radical chain and photocatalytic borylation reactions using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;borane as boron source is remarkable, the persistent problems, including the use of hazardous and high&#8208;energy radical initiators or the recyclability and photostability issues of soluble homogeneous photocatalysts, still leave great room for further development in a sustainable manner. Herein, we report a conceptually different approach toward highly functionalized organoborane synthesis by using recoverable ultrathin cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanosheets as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, and a general and mild borylation platform that enables regioselective borylation of a wide variety of alkenes (arylethenes, trifluoromethylalkenes, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and nitriles), alkynes, imines and electron&#8208;poor aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane as boryl radical precursor. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both photogenerated electrons and holes on the CdS fully perform their own roles, thereby resulting in enhancement of photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Water and Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two thiophene&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks were constructed, which enabled overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis with high production yields in the absence of sacrificial agents. A synergistic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) occurred under visible light in water and seawater to produce H2O2.







Abstract
H2O2 is a significant chemical widely utilized in the environmental and industrial fields, with growing global demand. Without sacrificial agents, simultaneous photocatalyzed H2O2 synthesis through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels from seawater is green and sustainable but still challenging. Herein, two novel thiophene&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (TD&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF) were first constructed and served as catalysts for H2O2 synthesis via indirect 2e&#8722; ORR and direct 2e&#8722; WOR channels. The photocatalytic H2O2 production performance can be regulated by adjusting the N&#8208;heterocycle modules (pyridine and triazine) in COFs. Notably, with no sacrificial agents, just using air and water as raw materials, TD&#8208;COF exhibited high H2O2 production yields of 4060&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 3364&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in deionized water and natural seawater, respectively. Further computational mechanism studies revealed that the thiophene was the primary photoreduction unit for ORR, while the benzene ring (linked to the thiophene by the imine bond) was the central photooxidation unit for WOR. The current work exploits thiophene&#8208;containing COFs for overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via ORR and WOR dual channels and provides fresh insight into creating innovative catalysts for photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Gradually Tuning the Flexibility of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks via Stepwise Structural Transformation and Their Flexibility&#8208;Dependent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the combination of linker exchange and linkage conversion strategies, we have achieved the regulation of flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and revealed the impact of different flexibility degree on properties of COFs, including breathing behavior, self&#8208;adaptability, and selective gas sorption.







Abstract
Flexible covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are intriguing for their dynamic properties distinctive from rigid counterparts but still suffer from limited accessibility. Especially, controlling flexibility of COFs is challenging and the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs has rarely been unveiled. This article reports stepwise adjustment on flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional COFs, which is realized by the designed synthesis of rigid COF (R&#8208;COF), semi&#8208;flexible COF (SF&#8208;COF), and flexible COF (F&#8208;COF) through polymerization, linker exchange, and linkage conversion with a newly developed method for reduction of hydrazone, respectively. Significant difference in breathing behavior and self&#8208;adaptive capability of the three COFs are uncovered through vapor response and iodine capture experiments. Gas sorption experiments indicate that the porosity of F&#8208;COF could switch from &#8220;close&#8221; state in nitrogen to &#8220;open&#8221; state in carbon dioxide, which are not observed for R&#8208;COF and SF&#8208;COF. This study not only develops a strategy to adjust the flexibility of COFs by tuning their linkers and linkages, but also provides a deep insight into the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs, which lays a foundation for the development of this new class of dynamic porous materials.

Significant difference in breathing behavior and self-adaptive capability of the three COFs are uncovered through vapor response and iodine capture experiments. Gas sorption experiments indicate that the porosity of F-COF could switch from &#8220;close&#8221; state in nitrogen to &#8220;open&#8221; state in carbon dioxide, which are not observed for R-COF and SF-COF. This study not only develops a strategy to adjust the flexibility of COFs by tuning their linkers and linkages, but also provides a deep insight into the impact of different flexibility on properties of COFs, which lays a foundation for the development of this new class of dynamic porous materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dinor[7]helicene and Beyond: Divergent Synthesis of Chiral Diradicaloids with Variable Open&#8208;Shell Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One starting material, two ring&#8208;forming steps, and three fusion patterns. A sequence of electrophilic cyclizations enables the first synthesis of dinor[7]helicene, a configurationally stable, redox&#8208;active diradicaloid analogue of [7]helicene. Strain&#8208;induced rearrangements of larger aromatic precursors provide access to non&#8208;benzenoid bis&#8208;helicenes, whose open&#8208;shell character depends on the connectivity between spin centers.







Abstract
Diradicaloid helicenes constructed formally by non&#8208;benzenoid double &#960;&#8208;extension of phenanthrene were synthesized by a common strategy involving double electrophilic benzannulation. Steric effects in the second benzannulation step led to considerable structural diversity among the products, yielding a symmetrical dinor[7]helicene 1 and two isomeric unsymmetrical double helicenes 2 and 3, containing a nor[5]helicene and [4]helicene fragment, respectively, in addition to a common nor[6]helicene motif. Geometries, configurational dynamics, and electronic structure of these helicenes were analyzed using solid&#8208;state structures, spectroscopic methods, and computational analyses. The open&#8208;shell character of the singlet states of these helicenes increases in the order 3&lt;1&lt;2, with strongly varying diradicaloid indexes and singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Compounds 1&#8211;3 displayed narrow optical gaps of 0.79&#8211;1.25&#8197;eV, resulting in significant absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region. They also exhibit reversible redox chemistry, each of them yielding stable radical cations, radical anions, and dianions, in some cases possessing intense NIR absorptions extending beyond 2500&#8197;nm.

         <title>Large Interlayer Distance and Heteroatom&#8208;Doping of Graphite Provide New Insights into the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Mechanism in Dual&#8208;Carbon Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cost and energy density of dual&#8208;ion batteries pose obstacles to their commercialization as large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. Here we address these issues by proposing a design strategy of graphite materials that involves a large interlayer distance and abundant doping of heteroatoms. This approach enables the realization of high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity dual&#8208;ion batteries as well as dual&#8208;carbon batteries.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, it is still questionable how material structures affect the anion storage behavior. In this paper, we synthesis graphite with an ultra&#8208;large interlayer distance and heteroatomic doping to systematically investigate the combined effects on DIBs. The large interlayer distance of 0.51&#8197;nm provides more space for anion storage, while the doping of the heteroatoms reduces the energy barriers for anion intercalation and migration and enhances rapid ionic storage at interfaces simultaneously. Based on the synergistic effects, the DIBs composed of carbon cathode and lithium anode afford ultra&#8208;high capacity of 240&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Dual&#8208;carbon batteries (DCBs) using the graphite as both of cathode and anode steadily cycle 2400 times at current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Hence, this work provides a reference to the strategy of material designs of DIBs and DCBs.

         <title>A Radical Pathway and Stabilized Li Anode Enabled by Halide Quaternary Ammonium Electrolyte Additives for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetrapropylammonium bromide (T3Br) additive in a Li&#8722;S electrolyte can trigger the S3&#8901;&#8722; radical pathway, which not only enhances the sulfur redox kinetics but also results in a 3D Li2S nuclation. In addition, the T3Br additive weakens the solvation structure of Li+ and creates a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface on Li anode.







Abstract
Passivation of the sulfur cathode by insulating lithium sulfide restricts the reversibility and sulfur utilization of Li&#8722;S batteries. 3D nucleation of Li2S enabled by radical conversion may significantly boost the redox kinetics. Electrolytes with high donor number (DN) solvents allow for tri&#8208;sulfur (S3&#8901;&#8722;) radicals as intermediates, however, the catastrophic reactivity of such solvents with Li anodes pose a great challenge for their practical application. Here, we propose the use of quaternary ammonium salts as electrolyte additives, which can preserve the partial high&#8208;DN characteristics that trigger the S3&#8901;&#8722; radical pathway, and inhibit the growth of Li dendrites. Li&#8722;S batteries with tetrapropylammonium bromide (T3Br) electrolyte additive deliver the outstanding cycling stability (700 cycles at 1&#8197;C with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049&#8201;% per cycle), and high capacity under a lean electrolyte of 5&#8197;&#956;Lelectrolyte&#8201;mgsulfur&#8722;1. This work opens a new avenue for the development of electrolyte additives for Li&#8722;S batteries.

Sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene has led to a series of structurally simple but highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks for semiconducting polymers having unipolar n&#8208;type transport characters with electron mobilities of &gt;1&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. The study offers inspiration for developing structurally simple electron&#8208;deficient units for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance but low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers remains a significant challenge in the commercialization of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). To achieve this objective, it is essential to design the key electron&#8208;deficient units with simple structures and facile preparation processes, which can facilitate the production of low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers. Herein, by sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene, we developed a series of structurally simple but highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadiene (CNDE), 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadiene (CNFDE), and 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadiene (CNDFDE), featuring a highly coplanar backbone and deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (&#8722;3.03&#8211;4.33&#8197;eV), which render them highly attractive for developing n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. Notably, all these electron&#8208;deficient units can be easily accessed by a two&#8208;step high&#8208;yield synthetic procedure from low&#8208;cost raw materials, thus rendering them highly promising candidates for commercial applications. Upon polymerization with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), three copolymers were developed that demonstrated unipolar n&#8208;type transport characteristics in OFETs with the highest electron mobility of &gt;1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Hence, CNDE, CNFDE, and CNDFDE represent a class of novel, simple, and efficient electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers, thereby providing valuable insight for OFET applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Way Catalysis in a Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction Limits Inhibition Induced by an External Electric Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented external electric field (EEF) catalyzes Diels&#8211;Alder reactions in one direction and inhibits them in the other. The inhibitory direction becomes rate&#8208;enhancing with increasing EEF. The EEF strength necessary to bring maximum inhibition is defined as the Electrostatic Resistance Point (ERP). ERP values gauge electrostatic interactions between substituents and external electrostatic stimuli.







Abstract
Oriented external electric fields (EEFs) act as catalysts that can induce selectivity in chemical reactions. The responses of the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and ethylene (BDE&#8208;DA) as well as cyclopentadiene and ethylene (CPDE&#8208;DA) towards EEF stimuli are investigated here using density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations. EEF is a vector that catalyzes the reaction in one direction while inhibiting it in the opposite direction. Here we report that the inhibitive direction becomes rate&#8208;enhancing after some increase in the EEF. The EEF value that brings about the maximum possible inhibition for the reaction is defined as the electrostatic resistance point (ERP). The possibility of both normal and inverse electron&#8208;demand DA reactions causes catalytic activity in both directions of the EEF starting at a unique ERP value. The C5 substituents of cyclopentadiene control the ERP values depending upon the resistance power that the functional group provides against the EEF. The endo and exo diastereomeric transition states of the DA reaction have distinct ERP values and the difference (&#916;ERP) provides the through&#8208;space electrostatic contribution to the stereoselectivity on a relative scale. Thus, the ERP values can be used as a gauge for the electrostatic interactions between substituent groups and external stimuli.

         <title>Biocompatible &#945;&#8208;Methylenation of Metabolic Butyraldehyde in Living Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing new abiotic chemistry into living cells is a grand challenge in the field of chemical biotechnology. Here, we show that phosphate and/or biogenic amines mediate the non&#8208;enzymatic &#945;&#8208;methylenation of butyraldehyde under biocompatible reaction conditions and can be interfaced with butyraldehyde biosynthesis from D&#8208;glucose in the bacterium Escherichia coli.







Abstract
Small molecule organocatalysts are abundant in all living organisms. However, their use as organocatalysts in cells has been underexplored. Herein, we report that organocatalytic aldol chemistry can be interfaced with living Escherichia coli to enable the &#945;&#8208;methylenation of cellular aldehydes using biogenic amines such as L&#8208;Pro or phosphate. The biocompatible reaction is mild and can be interfaced with butyraldehyde generated from D&#8208;glucose via engineered metabolism to enable the production of 2&#8208;methylenebutanal (2&#8208;MB) and 2&#8208;methylbutanal (2&#8208;MBA) by anaerobic fermentation, and 2&#8208;methylbutanol (2&#8208;MBO) by whole&#8208;cell catalysis. Overall, this study demonstrates the combination of non&#8208;enzymatic organocatalytic and metabolic reactions in vivo for the sustainable synthesis of valuable non&#8208;natural chemicals that cannot be accessed using enzymatic chemistry alone.

         <title>Preparative Scale Applications of C&#8722;H Activation in Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers examples where C&#8722;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale for the synthesis of drugs/drug candidates. Key features of the optimization process, challenges and potential of such methods in the pharmaceutical industry are discussed for various metals and transformations.







Abstract
C&#8722;H activation is an attractive methodology to increase molecular complexity without requiring substrate prefunctionalization. In contrast to well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling methods, C&#8722;H activation is less explored on large scales and its use in the production of pharmaceuticals faces substantial hurdles. However, the inherent advantages, such as shorter synthetic routes and simpler starting materials, motivate medicinal chemists and process chemists to overcome these challenges, and exploit C&#8722;H activation steps for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. In this review, we will cover examples of drugs/drug candidates where C&#8722;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale (range between 355&#8197;mg and 130&#8197;kg). The optimization processes will be described, and each example will be examined in terms of its advantages and disadvantages, providing the reader with an in&#8208;depth understanding of the challenges and potential of C&#8722;H activation methodologies in the production of pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Efficiencies of Various in situ Polymerizations of Liquid Electrolytes and the Practical Implications for Quasi Solid&#8208;state Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of polymerizations of double bond radical polymerization and ring&#8208;opening polymerization were investigated in the polymerizing conditions of catalyst, time, Li&#8208;salt, carbon black and solvent, and their influences on monomer conversion, Li+&#8208;conductivity and interfacial stability, showing the double bond radical polymerization is more suitable for the in situ solidification of electrolytes.







Abstract
In situ polymerization of liquid electrolytes is currently the most feasible way for constructing solid&#8208;state batteries, which, however, is affected by various interfering factors of reactions and so the electrochemical performance of cells. To disclose the effects from polymerization conditions, two types of generally used in situ polymerizing reactions of ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and double bond radical polymerization (DBRP) were investigated on the aspects of monomer conversion and electrochemical properties (Li+&#8208;conductivity and interfacial stability). The ROP generated poly&#8208;ester and poly&#8208;carbonate show a high monomer conversion of &#8776;90&#8201;%, but suffer a poor Li+&#8208;conductivity of lower than 2&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT). Additionally, the terminal alkoxy anion derived from the ROP is not resistant to high&#8208;voltage cathodes. While, the DBRP produced poly&#8208;VEC(vinyl ethylene carbonate) and poly&#8208;VC(vinylene carbonate) show lower monomer conversions of 50&#8211;80&#8201;%, delivering relatively higher Li+&#8208;conductivities of 2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at RT. Compared two polymerizing reactions and four monomers, the VEC&#8208;based F&#8208;containing copolymer possesses advantages in Li+&#8208;conductivity and antioxidant capacity, which also shows simultaneous stability towards Li&#8208;metal with the help of LiF&#8208;based passivating layer, allowing a long&#8208;term stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage quasi solid&#8208;state cells.

         <title>Spatially Directed Pyrolysis via Thermally Morphing Surface Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taming fire: Using morphing surfaces to control ignition and mass transport turns combustion to pyrolysis, hence slows rate of thermal degradation. Pyrolysis leads to incomplete combustion, hence graphitic tubes. This being a surface process, nm to &#956;m wide tubes are produced.







Abstract
Combustion is often difficult to spatially direct or tune associated kinetics&#8212;hence a run&#8208;away reaction. Coupling pyrolytic chemical transformation to mass transport and reaction rates (Damk&#246;hler number), however, we spatially directed ignition with concomitant switch from combustion to pyrolysis (low oxidant). A &#8216;surface&#8208;then&#8208;core&#8217; order in ignition, with concomitant change in burning rate,is therefore established. Herein, alkysilanes grafted onto cellulose fibers are pyrolyzed into non&#8208;flammable SiO2 terminating surface ignition propagation, hence stalling flame propagating. Sustaining high temperatures, however, triggers ignition in the bulk of the fibers but under restricted gas flow (oxidant and/or waste) hence significantly low rate of ignition propagation and pyrolysis compared to open flame (Li&#241;&#225;n's equation). This leads to inside&#8208;out thermal degradation and, with felicitous choice of conditions, formation of graphitic tubes. Given the temperature dependence, imbibing fibers with an exothermically oxidizing synthon (MnCl2) or a heat sink (KCl) abets or inhibits pyrolysis leading to tuneable wall thickness. We apply this approach to create magnetic, paramagnetic, or oxide containing carbon fibers. Given the surface sensitivity, we illustrate fabrication of nm&#8208; and &#956;m&#8208;diameter tubes from appropriately sized fibers.

We apply this approach to create magnetic, paramagnetic, or oxide containing carbon fibers. Given the surface sensitivity, we illustrate fabrication of nm- and &#956;m-diameter tubes from appropriately sized fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(Ethylene Piperidinium)s for Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of ionic crosslinking into high&#8208;cationic&#8208;ratio AEMs to suppress high water uptake and swelling while further improving the hydroxide conductivity. This strategy limited the dimensional change and water uptake of the AEMs, with a high hydroxide conductivity observed. The chemical design used in this study presents a significant advancement toward developing AEMs showing high conductivity and stability simultaneously for fuel cell applications.







Abstract
The lack of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) that possess both high hydroxide conductivity and stable mechanical and chemical properties poses a major challenge to the development of high&#8208;performance fuel cells. Improving one side of the balance between conductivity and stability usually means sacrificing the other. Herein, we used facile, high&#8208;yield chemical reactions to design and synthesize a piperidinium polymer with a polyethylene backbone for AEM fuel cell applications. To improve the performance, we introduced ionic crosslinking into high&#8208;cationic&#8208;ratio AEMs to suppress high water uptake and swelling while further improving the hydroxide conductivity. Remarkably, PEP80&#8208;20PS achieved a hydroxide conductivity of 354.3&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C while remaining mechanically stable. Compared with the base polymer PEP80, the water uptake of PEP80&#8208;20PS decreased by 69&#8201;% from 813&#8201;% to 350&#8201;%, and the swelling decreased substantially by 85&#8201;% from 350.0&#8201;% to 50.2&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C. PEP80&#8208;20PS also showed excellent alkaline stability, 84.7&#8201;% remained after 35&#8197;days of treatment with an aqueous KOH solution. The chemical design in this study represents a significant advancement toward the development of simultaneously highly stable and conductive AEMs for fuel cell applications.

         <title>Experimental Quantification of Halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Arene van der Waals Contacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interactions are measured in 17 different solvents using molecular balances. The Me&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interaction was always found to be more favorable than any halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interaction. London dispersion interactions involving the larger, more polarizable halogen atoms are unable to outcompete the electrostatic and steric terms that determine the interaction energy trend.







Abstract
Crystallographic and computational studies suggest the occurrence of favourable interactions between polarizable arenes and halogen atoms. However, the systematic experimental quantification of halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interactions in solution has been hindered by the large variance in the steric demands of the halogens. Here we have synthesized molecular balances to quantify halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene contacts in 17 solvents and solvent mixtures using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Calculations indicate that favourable halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interactions arise from London dispersion in the gas phase. In contrast, comparison of our experimental measurements with partitioned SAPT0 energies indicate that dispersion is sufficiently attenuated by the solvent that the halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene interaction trend was instead aligned with increasing exchange repulsion as the halogen increased in size (&#916;GX&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ph=0 to +1.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene contacts were slightly less disfavoured in solvents with higher solvophobicities and lower polarizabilities, but strikingly, were always less favoured than CH3&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;arene contacts (&#916;GMe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ph=0 to &#8722;1.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Efficient Polyethylene Hydrocracking over Two&#8208;Dimensional Platinum&#8208;Anchored Tungsten Trioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical upcycling of high&#8208;density polyethylene at low temperatures remains a significant challenge. In their Research Article (e202305644), Qingyue Wang, Pingwei Liu and co&#8208;workers report a two&#8208;dimensional platinum&#8208;anchored tungsten trioxide catalyst with abundant vacancies and acidic sites that converts polyethylene effectively to fuel. A quasi&#8208;operando spectroscopic study reveals that polymer chains are activated by forming olefinic intermediates, and then hydrocracked by the dissociated hydrogen&#160;on two&#8208;dimensional catalyst&#160;to form fuel alkanes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular doping is a key technique to modulate optical, electrical, and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. However, typical functional groups in organic p&#8208;dopants have insufficient electron&#8208;withdrawing strength, and inevitable dopant diffusion in host matrices degrades doping stabilities. In their Research Article (e202304245), Jaeyoung Jang and co&#8208;workers develop extremely electron&#8208;withdrawing Lewis&#8208;paired CN groups as a new class of building blocks for designing strong organic p&#8208;dopants with excellent doping stability.

         <title>Synthetic Heparanase Inhibitors Can Prevent Herpes Simplex Viral Spread</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herpes simplex virus (HSV&#8208;1) employs heparan sulfate (HS) as receptor for cell attachment and entry. During late&#8208;stage infection, the virus induces the upregulation of human heparanase (Hpse) to remove cell surface HS allowing viral spread. We hypothesized that inhibition of Hpse will prevent viral release thereby representing a new therapeutic strategy for HSV&#8208;1. A range of HS&#8208;oligosaccharides was prepared to examine the importance of chain length and 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfation of iduronic moieties for Hpse inhibition. It was found that hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides potently inhibited the enzymes and that 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfation of iduronic acid is tolerated. Computational studies provided a rationale for the observed structure&#8208;activity relationship. Treatment of human corneal epithelial cells (HCEs) infected with HSV&#8208;1 with the hexa&#8208; and octasaccharide blocked viral induced shedding of HS which significantly reduced spread of virions. The compounds also inhibited migration and proliferation of immortalized HCEs thereby providing additional therapeutic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Induced Charge Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering on a Semiconductor: Toward Amplification&#8208;Free Quantification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semiconductors demonstrate great potentials as chemical mechanism&#8208;based surfaceenhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates in determination of biological species in complex living systems with high selectivity. However, low sensitivity is the bottleneck for their practical applications, compared with that of noble metal&#8208;based Raman enhancement ascribed to electro&#8208;magnetic mechanism. Herein, a novel Cu2O nanoarray with free carrier density of 1.78*1021 cm&#8208;3 comparable to that of noble metals was self&#8208;assembled, creating a record in enhancement factor (EF) of 3.19&#215;1010 among semiconductor substrates. The significant EF was mainly attributed to plasmon&#8208;induced hot electron transfer (PIHET) in semiconductor which was never&#160;reported before. This Cu2O nanoarray was subsequently developed as a highly sensitive and selective SERS chip for non&#8208;enzyme and amplification&#8208;free SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA quantification with a detection limit down to 60 copies/mL within 5 min. This unique Cu2O nanoarray demonstrated the significant Raman enhancement through PIHET process, enabling rapid and sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of emerging virus variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable Carbo&#8208; and Silicon&#8208;Rhodamines and Their Application in MINFLUX Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New photoactivatable fluorescent dyes (rhodamine, carbo&#8208; and silicon&#8208;rhodamines [SiR]) with emission ranging from green to far red have been prepared, and their photophysical properties studied. The photocleavable 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl unit with an alpha&#8208;carboxyl group as a branching point and additional functionality was attached to a polycyclic and lipophilic fluorescent dye. The photoactivatable probes having the HaloTagTM amine (O2) ligand bound with a dye core were obtained and applied for live&#8208;cell staining in stable cell lines incorporating Vimentin (VIM) or Nuclear Pore Complex Protein NUP96 fused with the HaloTag. The probes were applied in 2D (VIM, NUP96) and 3D (VIM) MINFLUX nanoscopy, as well as in superresolution fluorescence microscopy with single fluorophore activation (VIM, live&#8208;cell labeling). Images of VIM and NUPs labeled with different dyes were acquired and their apparent dimensions and shapes assessed on a lower single&#8208;digit nanometer scale. Applicability and performance of the photoactivatable dye derivatives were evaluated in terms of photoactivation rate, labeling and detection efficiency, number of detected photons per molecule and other parameters related to MINFLUX nanoscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>An In Situ Investigation of the Protein Corona Formation Kinetics of Single Nanomedicine Carriers by Self&#8208;Regulated Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein corona extensively exists at the bio&#8211;nano interface due to the natural adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials in biological fluids. Aside from the robust property of nanoparticles, the dynamics of the protein corona shell largely define their chemical identity by altering interface properties. However, the soft coronas are normally complex and rapidly changed. To real&#8208;time trace the entire formation, we report here a self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the interaction of the Ru(bpy)33+ with nanoparticle surface. Thus, the heterogeneity in protein corona data is in situ observed on single nanoparticle &#8220;core&#8221; before and after loading drugs in nanomedicine carriers. The label&#8208;free, optical stable and dynamic ECL microscopy minimize misinterpretations caused by the variation of nanoparticle size and polydispersity. Accordingly, the synergetic actions of proteins and nanoparticles properties are uncovered by chemically engineered protein corona. After comparing the protein corona formation kinetics in different complex systems and different nanomedicine carriers, the universality and accuracy of this technique were well demonstrated via the ECL kinetics curves regulated by competitive adsorption of Ru(bpy)33+ and multiple proteins on surface of various carriers. The work is of great significance for studying bio&#8208;nano interface in drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Chainmail: Steric Hindrance and Charge Compensation of Anion&#8208;Doped PEDOT to Boost Stress Deformation of Compressible Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conducting polymers with high theoretical capacitance and deformability are among the optimal candidates for compressible supercapacitor electrode materials. However, achieving both mechanical and electrochemical stabilities in a single electrode remains a great challenge. To address this issue, the "Polymer Chainmail" is proposed with reversible deformation capability and enhances stability because of the steric hindrance and charge compensation effect of doped anions. As a proof of concept, four common anions are selected as dopants for Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and their effects on the adsorption and diffusion of H+ on PEDOT are verified using density functional theory calculations. Owing to the film formation effect, the PF&#8211;6 doped PEDOT/Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon foam exhibits good mechanical properties. Furthermore, the composite demonstrates excellent rate performance and stability due to suitable anion doping. This finding provides new insights into the preparation of electrochemically stable conductive polymer&#8208;based compressible electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise control over hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures relying on the elaboration of multiple noncovalent interactions between basic building blocks is both elusive and highly desirable. We herein reported a terpyridine&#8208;based metallo&#8208;cage T with tetrahedra motif and utilized it as an efficient building block for controlled hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures in response to different halide ions. Initially, the hierarchical superstructure of metallo&#8208;cage T adopted a hexagonal close&#8208;packed manner. By adding Cl&#713;/Br&#713; or I&#713;, respectively, drastically different hierarchical superstructures with highly&#8208;tight hexagonal packing or graphite&#8208;like packing arrangements have been achieved. This unusual halide ions triggered hierarchically structural change resulted in quite distinct intermolecular channels, which provides a new insight into the mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular aggregation and crystal growth based on macromolecular construction. In addition, chiral induction of the metallo&#8208;cage T can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP&#8208; or MMMM&#8208; type enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile, versatile and stepwise synthesis of high&#8208;performance oligomer acceptors for stable organic solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomer acceptors have&#160;recently emerged as&#160;promising photovoltaic materials&#160;for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited availability of diverse acceptors, resulting from the sole synthetic approach, has hindered their potential for future industrialization.&#160;In this study, we present a facile and effective stepwise approach that utilizes two consecutive Stille coupling reactions for the synthesis of oligomer acceptors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach, we successfully synthesize a trimer acceptor, Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD, and further systematically investigate the impact of oligomerization on device performance and stability. The result reveals that this approach has significant advantages compared to the conventional method, such as reduced formation of unwanted by&#8208;products and lower difficulties in purification. Remarkably, the OSC based on PM6:Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD achieves an impressive PCE of 18.03% and maintains 80% of the initial PCE (T80) for 1523&#160;h under illumination, surpassing the performance of the corresponding small molecule acceptor Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based device.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oligomer acceptors have&#160;recently emerged as&#160;promising photovoltaic materials&#160;for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited availability of diverse acceptors, resulting from the sole synthetic approach, has hindered their potential for future industrialization.&#160;In this study, we present a facile and effective stepwise approach that utilizes two consecutive Stille coupling reactions for the synthesis of oligomer acceptors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach, we successfully synthesize a trimer acceptor, Tri-Y6-OD, and further systematically investigate the impact of oligomerization on device performance and stability. The result reveals that this approach has significant advantages compared to the conventional method, such as reduced formation of unwanted by-products and lower difficulties in purification. Remarkably, the OSC based on PM6:Tri-Y6-OD achieves an impressive PCE of 18.03% and maintains 80% of the initial PCE (T80) for 1523&#160;h under illumination, surpassing the performance of the corresponding small molecule acceptor Y6-OD-based device. Furthermore, the versatility of the synthetic strategy in obtaining diverse acceptors is further demonstrated. Overall, our findings provide a&#160;facile, versatile and stepwise&#160;way&#160;for synthesizing&#160;oligomeric acceptors, thereby facilitating the development of stable and efficient OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turning on Asymmetric Catalysis of Achiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks by Imparting Chiral Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts has attracted increasing interest in synthetic chemistry but mostly relies on the immobilization of homogeneous chiral catalysts. Herein, a series of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been fabricated by anchoring similar chiral hydroxylated molecules (catalytically inactive) with different lengths onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters in achiral PCN&#8208;222(Cu). The resulting chiral MOFs exhibit regulated enantioselectivity up to 83% ee in the asymmetric ring&#8208;opening of cyclohexene oxide. The chiral molecules furnished onto the catalytic Lewis sites in the MOF create multilevel microenvironment, including the hydrogen interaction between the substrate and the chiral &#8208;OH group, the steric hindrance endowed by the benzene ring on the chiral molecules, and the proximity between the catalytic sites and chiral molecules confined in the MOF pores, which play crucial roles and synergistically promote chiral catalysis. This work unprecedentedly achieves heterogeneous enantioselective catalysis by chiral microenvironment modulation around Lewis acid sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Productivity of the Direct Conversion of Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol over Copper&#8208;Exchanged Zeolite Omega (MAZ) via Oxygen Looping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;omega (MAZ) is a very active and selective material for the methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) conversion using the oxygen looping approach. By determining the productivity via a novel screening method combining operando XAS and mass spectrometry, this body of work shows the potential this material exhibits for industrial valorization, as well as a screening method for other materials utilizing the oxygen looping approach.







Abstract
The methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) conversion via the oxygen looping approach using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites has been extensively studied over the last decade. While a lot of research has focussed on maximizing yield and selectivity, little has been directed toward productivity&#8212;a metric far more meaningful for evaluating industrial potential. Using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega), a material highly active and selective for the MtM conversion using the isothermal oxygen looping approach, we show that this material exhibits unprecedented potential for industrial valorization. In doing so, we also present a novel methodology combining operando XAS and mass spectrometry for the screening of materials for the MtM conversion in oxygen looping mode.

         <title>Introducing Bidirectional Axial Coordination into BiVO4@Metal Phthalocyanine Core&#8211;Shell Photoanodes for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazine was adopted as axial coordination agent for the first time to construct core&#8211;shell BiVO4@metal polyphthalocyanine photoanode. The axial coordination of pyrazine facilitated the carrier transfer across the BiVO4 and metal phthalocyanine interface and endowed ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine with lower Fe d band center and orbital spin, which improved the OER activity by promoting the *OOH desorption.







Abstract
Core&#8208;shell photoanodes have shown great potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, the construction of a high&#8208;quality interface between the core and shell, as well as a highly catalytic surface, remains a challenge. Herein, guided by computation, we present a BiVO4 photoanode coated with ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine using pyrazine as a coordination agent. The bidirectional axial coordination of pyrazine plays a dual role by facilitating intimate interfacial contact between BiVO4 and ZnCoFe polyphthalocyanine, as well as regulating the electron density and spin configuration of metal sites in ZnCoFe phthalocyanine, thereby promoting the potential&#8208;limiting step of *OOH desorption. The resulting photoanode displayed a high photocurrent density of 5.7&#177;0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE. This study introduces a new approach for constructing core&#8211;shell photoanodes, and uncovers the key role of pyrazine axial coordination in modulating the catalytic activity of metal phthalocyanine.

         <title>Mild Synthesis of Polychlorinated Arenes for Efficient Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with Dual Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and direct method has been developed to synthesize polychlorinated heteroatom polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through an intermediate electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex. The developed polychlorinated emitter could act as a dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diode as a result of the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of the chlorine atoms.







Abstract
Polychlorinated (hetero)arenes have shown great promise for organic optoelectronics applications. However, the harsh synthetic routes for polychlorinated compounds and the possible luminescence quenching from the compact intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking induced by chlorine atoms limit their investigations and applications in luminescent materials. Herein, two isomeric polychlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds JY&#8208;1&#8208;Cl and JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl consisting of rigidified aryl ketones and amine are designed and synthesized under mild conditions through nucleophilic chlorination intermediated by an electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex. Among them, as a result of the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induced by chlorine atoms, JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl exhibits bright monomer and dimer emissions with dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characters. Notably, compared with the non&#8208;chlorinated compounds, a high photoluminescence quantum yield is maintained after introducing multiple chlorine atoms into JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl. The first dual&#8208;TADF organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are also successfully fabricated with maximum external quantum efficiency as high as 29.1&#8201;% by employing JY&#8208;2&#8208;Cl as emitter. This work presents a new paradigm and synthesis of polychlorinated amine&#8208;carbonyl PAHs and demonstrates the great potential of the chlorinated materials for luminescent applications.

         <title>Triplet Generation Through Singlet Fission in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: An Alternative Route to Inefficient Singlet&#8208;Triplet Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet to triplet intersystem crossing can be inhibited in organic chromophore assemblies within crystalline porous MOFs due to a diminished Franck&#8208;Condon overlap between spatially disparate singlet (delocalized) and triplet (localized) wavefunctions. Singlet fission&#8212;occurring through an electron superexchange process&#8212;can be a viable route to achieve high&#8208;yield, low&#8208;energy triplets in framework&#8208;based energy conversion systems.







Abstract
High quantum yield triplets, populated by initially prepared excited singlets, are desired for various energy conversion schemes in solid working compositions like porous MOFs. However, a large disparity in the distribution of the excitonic center of mass, singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) in such assemblies is inhibited, so much so that a carboxy&#8208;coordinated zirconium heavy metal ion cannot effectively facilitate the ISC through spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Circumventing this sluggish ISC, singlet fission (SF) is explored as a viable route to generating triplets in solution&#8208;stable MOFs. Efficient SF is achieved through a high degree of interchromophoric coupling that facilitates electron super&#8208;exchange to generate triplet pairs. Here we show that a predesigned chromophoric linker with extremely poor ISC efficiency (kISC) but 
 form triplets in MOF in contrast to the frameworks that are built from linkers with sizable kISC but 
. This work opens a new photophysical and photochemical avenue in MOF chemistry and utility in energy conversion schemes.

         <title>Solvation Modulation Enhances Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Deep Cycling of Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is reported as an electrolyte additive to achieve deep cycling of Zn anodes. HMPA reshapes the solvation structures and promotes anion (OTF&#8722;) decomposition, which in situ forms an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. More interestingly, this anion decomposition does not involve HMPA, which is beneficial for its long&#8208;term impact on the electrolyte.







Abstract
Stable Zn anodes with a high utilization efficiency pose a challenge due to notorious dendrite growth and severe side reactions. Therefore, electrolyte additives are developed to address these issues. However, the additives are always consumed by the electrochemical reactions over cycling, affecting the cycling stability. Here, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is reported as an electrolyte additive for achieving stable cycling of Zn anodes. HMPA reshapes the solvation structures and promotes anion decomposition, leading to the in situ formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. More interestingly, this anion decomposition does not involve HMPA, preserving its long&#8208;term impact on the electrolyte. Thus, the symmetric cells with HMPA in the electrolyte survive &#8776;500&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or &#8776;200&#8197;h at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Zn utilization rate of 85.6&#8201;%. The full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio=12&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.8) and a high areal capacity (6.6&#8197;mAh&#8197;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Electronic Interactions on Platinum/(Metal&#8208;Oxide)&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Boost Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4, with a CH4 selectivity of 100&#8201;%, is achieved on a CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst with electronic Pt&#8722;In2O3 interactions that are beneficial for charge separation and CO2 conversion to CO2&#948;&#8722;, which can be easily hydrogenated into CH4. The enhancement effect of electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions on selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 may extend to other common Pt/(metal&#8208;oxide)&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
By supporting platinum (Pt) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles on indium oxide (In2O3), we fabricated a CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst. Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) was achieved on CdS/Pt/In2O3 with electronic Pt&#8722;In2O3 interactions, with CH4 selectivity reaching to 100&#8201;%, which is higher than that on CdS/Pt/In2O3 without electronic Pt&#8722;In2O3 interactions (71.7&#8201;%). Moreover, the enhancement effect of electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions on selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 also occurs by using other common metal oxides, such as photocatalyst supports, including titanium oxide, gallium oxide, zinc oxide, and tungsten oxide. The electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions separate photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and convert CO2 into CO2&#948;&#8722;, which can be easily hydrogenated into CH4 via a CO2&#948;&#8722;&#8594;HCOO*&#8594;HCO*&#8594;CH*&#8594;CH4 path, thus boosting selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. This offers a new way to achieve selective photoreduction of CO2.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Rich Supramolecular Nano&#8208;Container Crosslinked Hydrogel for Lithium Extraction with Super&#8208;High Capacity and Extreme Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust fluorine&#8208;containing hydrogel was made by incorporating supramolecular nanosheets from fluorinated monomers in a one&#8208;pot polymerization. It shows a high lithium adsorption capacity (Qm Li+=122.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and selectivity for Li+. Separation of Li+/Na+ in actual wastewater is achieved with a separation factor of 153.72. The recovery capability and Li+ selectivity are associated with specific coordination between lithium and fluorine.







Abstract
Extraction and recovery of lithium from reserves play a critical role in the sustainable development of energy due to the explosive growth of the lithium&#8208;battery market. However, the low efficiency of extraction and recovery seriously threatens the sustainability of lithium supply. In this contribution, we fabricate a novel mechanically robust fluorine&#8208;rich hydrogel, showing highly efficient Li+ extraction from Li&#8208;containing solutions. The hydrogel was facilely fabricated by simple one&#8208;pot polymerization of supramolecular nanosheets of fluorinated monomers, acrylic acid and a small amount of chemical crosslinkers. The hydrogel exhibits a remarkable lithium adsorption capacity (Qm Li+=122.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and can be reused. Moreover, it can exclusively extract lithium ions from multiple co&#8208;existing metal ions. Notably, the separation of Li+/Na+ in actual wastewater is achieved with a surprising separation factor of 153.72. The detailed characterizations as well as calculation showed that the specific coordination of Li&#8722;F plays a central role for both of the striking recovery capability and selectivity for Li+. Furthermore, an artificial device was constructed, displaying high efficiency of extracting lithium in various complex actual lithium&#8208;containing wastewater. This work provides a new and promising avenue for the efficient extraction and recovery of lithium resource from complex lithium&#8208;containing solutions.

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) AIE&#8208;inorganic nanocomposites exhibit high stability and high fluorescence activity. However, limited by the types and properties of 2D inorganic materials, it&#8217;s challenging to realize complex structures and functions. We designed a quaternary ammonium&#8208;type AIE ligand, TPECholine. We chose TPECholine and POM clusters as building blocks and synthesized a series of single&#8208;layer nanosheets (SLNSs) by assembling LnW10 or P2W18 POM clusters with TPECholine. By regulating the types of POM clusters and ligands, the morphology and fluorescence intensity of the SLNSs can be finely tuned. Due to the restriction of the intramolecular motions of AIEgens by the SLNSs, nanosheets can exhibit promoted quantum yield (up to 76%). In addition, thanks to the sub&#8208;nanometric sizes and excess surface charges, SLNSs exhibit excellent solvent compatibility, including water, chloroform, ethanol, etc. And the nanosheets showed high fluorescence intensity in these solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Cascade Nanozymes with Antisenescence Activities for Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated cascade nanozyme with superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like activities is proposed. Providing cascade nanozyme MSe1 with antisenescence activities as a therapeutic intervention against oxidative stress in senescent cells provides a new treatment for atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Senescent cells are the critical drivers of atherosclerosis formation and maturation. Mitigating senescent cells holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In an atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment, senescent cells interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting the disease development. Here, we hypothesize that a cascade nanozyme with antisenescence and antioxidant activities can serve as an effective therapeutic for atherosclerosis. An integrated cascade nanozyme with superoxide dismutase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, named MSe1, is developed in this work. The obtained cascade nanozyme can attenuate human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) senescence by protecting DNA from damage. It significantly weakens inflammation in macrophages and HUVECs by eliminating overproduced intracellular ROS. Additionally, the MSe1 nanozyme effectively inhibits foam cell formation in macrophages and HUVECs by decreasing the internalization of oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein. After intravenous administration, the MSe1 nanozyme significantly inhibits the formation of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (ApoE&#8722;/&#8722;) mice by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and then decreases the infiltration of inflammatory cells and senescent cells in atherosclerotic plaques. This study not only provides a cascade nanozyme but also suggests that the combination of antisenescence and antioxidative stress holds considerable promise for treating atherosclerosis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The doping of group&#8197;8 and 9 metals having unpaired d electrons into a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster was demonstrated. Open d&#8208;shell group&#8197;8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Rh, Ir) metal atoms could be incorporated into the Ag24(SR)18 superatomic framework by forming metal&#8208;hydride superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence intensities and lifetimes.







Abstract
We report a new strategy in which a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster can be doped with open d&#8208;shell group&#8197;8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Ir) metals by forming metal hydride (RuH2, OsH2, IrH) superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. Structural analyses using various experimental and theoretical methods revealed that the Ag25 nanoclusters were co&#8208;doped with the open d&#8208;shell metal and hydride species to produce superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters, establishing a novel superatom doping phenomenon for open d&#8208;shell metals. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Comparative PL lifetime studies of the Ag25 nanoclusters doped with 8&#8211;10&#8197;group metals revealed that both radiative and nonradiative processes were significantly dependent on the dopant. The former is strongly correlated with the electron affinity of the metal dopant, whereas the latter is governed predominantly by the kernel structure changed upon the doping of the metal hydride(s).

         <title>The Effect of the Axle End Structure and Number of Through&#8208;Space Bonds on the Properties of Rotaxane Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structure&#8208;definite rotaxane crosslinkers were synthesized to evaluate the mechanism for toughening a rotaxane crosslinked polymer (RCP). The size of the axle end was important for toughening RCP, and a [3]rotaxane crosslinker worked more effectively than a [2]rotaxane. The mobility of the crosslinking point, in terms of the rotational and flipping movements, was more crucial for toughening RCP than the translational movement.







Abstract
A rotaxane crosslinker (RC) is known to toughen the resulting rotaxane crosslinked polymer (RCP) via a stress dispersion effect that is attributed to the movable nature of the crosslinking structure. To evaluate this toughening mechanism in detail, a series of structure&#8208;definite RCs equipped with different axle end structures or different numbers of wheel components were synthesized, and subjected to free radical polymerization with a vinyl monomer to obtain RCPs. Analyses of the obtained RCPs revealed that the size of the axle end structure should be well&#8208;balanced to produce a strong toughening effect, and a [3]rotaxane crosslinker works more effectively than [2]rotaxane to toughen RCPs. The mobility of the crosslinking points, in terms of rotational and flipping movements, was more crucial to toughening the RCP than that of translational movement along the axle. The first observation of the above crucial findings proved the utility of the systematic molecular design used in this study.

         <title>Accelerating Gas Escape in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis by Gas Diffusion Layers with Hierarchical Grid Gradients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the AEMWE's mass transport and performance can be significantly improved by simply manipulating the structure of the GDLs. We use 3D printing to fabricate a series of GDLs with adjustable grid sizes. A suitable GDL grid size can accelerate mass transport by reducing the gas bubble size and the bubble resident time. Then a novel hierarchical GDL was made to highly promote the mass transport of AEMWE at high current densities.







Abstract
At high current densities, gas bubble escape is the critical factor affecting the mass transport and performance of the electrolyzer. For tight assembly water electrolysis technologies, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) between the catalyst layer (CL) and the flow field plate plays a critical role in gas bubble removal. Herein, we demonstrate that the electrolyzer's mass transport and performance can be significantly improved by simply manipulating the structure of the GDL. Combined with 3D printing technology, ordered nickel GDLs with straight&#8208;through pores and adjustable grid sizes are systematically studied. Using an in situ high&#8208;speed camera, the gas bubble releasing size and resident time have been observed and analyzed upon the change of the GDL architecture. The results show that a suitable grid size of the GDL can significantly accelerate mass transport by reducing the gas bubble size and the bubble resident time. An adhesive force measurement has further revealed the underlying mechanism. We then proposed and fabricated a novel hierarchical GDL, reaching a current density of 2&#8197;A/cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.95&#8197;V and 80&#8201;&#176;C, one of the highest single&#8208;cell performances in pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE).

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Cathode by sp&#8208;Carbon Induced Conversion in Multi&#8208;Level Structure of Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;free CuS cathode with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer confinement structure is constructed readily with graphdiyne. It integrates the advantages of graphdiyne and produces abundant sp&#8208;C&#8208;S&#8208;Cu hybridization bonds. The new hybridization bond regulates the conversion reaction, and the 2D confinement of graphdiyne avoids structural collapse and shuttle effect. Such cathode delivers an energy density of 934&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a robust lifespan of 3000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;level architecture formed alternatively by the conformal graphdiyne (GDY) and CuS is well engineered for Li&#8208;free cathode. Such a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept architecture efficiently integrates the advantages of GDY and produces new functional heterojunctions (sp&#8722;C&#8722;S&#8722;Cu hybridization bond). The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer 2D confinement effect successfully avoids structural collapse, the selective transport inhibits the shuttling of active components, and the interfacial sp&#8722;C&#8722;S&#8722;Cu hybridization bond significantly regulates the phase conversion reaction. Such new sp&#8722;C&#8722;S&#8722;Cu hybridization of GDY greatly improves the reaction dynamics and reversibility, and the cathode delivers an energy density of 934&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and an unattenuated lifespan of 3000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. Our results indicate that the GDY&#8208;based interface strategy will greatly promote the efficient utilization of the conversion&#8208;type cathodes.

         <title>Structural Evolution of Giant Polyoxometalate: From &#8220;Keplerate&#8221; to &#8220;Lantern&#8221; Type Mo132 for Improved Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new structural variant (L&#8208;Mo132) of the giant Keplerate type polyoxometalate Mo132 (K&#8208;Mo132) was synthesized. It features lantern type structure and contains multiple terminal coordinated H2O molecules on the outer surface. Its catalytic activity for the phenol oxidation reaction is superior to that of K&#8208;Mo132.







Abstract
Structural variants of high&#8208;nuclearity clusters are extremely important for their modular assembly study and functional expansion, yet the synthesis of such giant structural variants remains a great challenge. Herein, we prepared a lantern&#8208;type giant polymolybdate cluster (L&#8208;Mo132) containing equal metal nuclearity with the famous Keplerate type Mo132 (K&#8208;Mo132). The skeleton of L&#8208;Mo132 features a rare truncated rhombic triacontrahedron, which is totally different with the truncated icosahedral K&#8208;Mo132. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to observe such structural variants in high&#8208;nuclearity cluster built up of more than 100 metal atoms. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals that L&#8208;Mo132 has good stability. More importantly, because the pentagonal [Mo6O27]n&#8722; building blocks in L&#8208;Mo132 are concave instead of convex in the outer face, it contains multiple terminal coordinated water molecules on its outer surface, which make it expose more active metal sites to display superior phenol oxidation performance, which is more higher than that of K&#8208;Mo132 coordinated in M=O bonds on the outer surface.

         <title>Guiding Principles for the Rational Design of Hybrid Materials: Use of DFT Methodology for Evaluating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in a Uranyl Tetrahalide Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl tetrahalide supramolecular systems are investigated using both experiment and Density Functional Theory. We intend to investigate the effect that hydrogen bonding may have on the formation enthalpies of these systems. Here, we demonstrate that an expanded network of hydrogen bonds can stabilize supramolecular complexes and directly affect their formation enthalpies.







Abstract
Together with the synthesis and experimental characterization of 14 hybrid materials containing [UO2X4]2&#8722; (X=Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;) and organic cations, we report on novel methods for determining correlation trends in their formation enthalpy (&#916;Hf) and observed vibrational signatures. &#916;Hf values were analyzed through isothermal acid calorimetry and a Density Functional Theory+Thermodynamics (DFT+T) approach with results showing good agreement between theory and experiment. Three factors (packing efficiency, cation protonation enthalpy, and hydrogen bonding energy [
]) were assessed as descriptors for trends in &#916;Hf. Results demonstrated a strong correlation between 
 and &#916;Hf, highlighting the importance of hydrogen bonding networks in determining the relative stability of solid&#8208;state hybrid materials. Lastly, we investigate how hydrogen bonding networks affect the vibrational characteristics of uranyl solid&#8208;state materials using experimental Raman and IR spectroscopy and theoretical bond orders and find that hydrogen bonding can red&#8208;shift U&#8801;O stretching modes. Overall, the tightly integrated experimental and theoretical studies presented here bridge the trends in macroscopic thermodynamic energies and spectroscopic features with molecular&#8208;level details of the geometry and electronic structure. This modeling framework forms a basis for exploring 3D hydrogen bonding as a tunable design feature in the pursuit of supramolecular materials by rational design.

         <title>Versatile Biocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxyfunctionalization for the Site&#8208; Selective and Stereodivergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases (AADs) are repurposed for applications in biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization. Activity profiling of natural AADs enabled the synthesis of four types of &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids with broad scope, high efficiency, and good selectivity.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;H oxyfunctionalization, the insertion of an O&#8208;atom into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, streamlines the synthesis of complex molecules from easily accessible precursors and represents one of the most challenging tasks in organic chemistry with regard to site and stereoselectivity. Biocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxyfunctionalization has the potential to overcome limitations inherent to small&#8208;molecule&#8208;mediated approaches by delivering catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity. Through enzyme repurposing and activity profiling of natural variants, we have developed a subfamily of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron dioxygenases that catalyze the site&#8208; and stereodivergent oxyfunctionalization of secondary and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, providing concise synthetic routes towards four types of 92 &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids with high efficiency and selectivity. This method provides a biocatalytic approach for the production of valuable but synthetically challenging chiral hydroxy acid building blocks.

Through enzyme repurposing and activity profiling of natural variants, we have developed a subfamily of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ketoglutarate-dependent iron dioxygenases that catalyze the site- and stereodivergent oxyfunctionalization of secondary and tertiary C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds, providing concise synthetic routes towards four types of 92 &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy acids with high efficiency and selectivity. This method provides a biocatalytic approach for the production of valuable but synthetically challenging chiral hydroxy acid building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design Rules for Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Incorporated Perovskites (OSiP) Gleaned from Thousands of Simulated Structures
</title>

2D halide perovskites can accommodate a vast array of organic semiconducting ligands to potentially augment their functionality. A library of over 104 perovskites have been characterized by molecular dynamics and used to train machine learning models.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are an attractive class of hybrid perovskites that have additional optoelectronic tunability due to their accommodation of relatively large organic ligands. Nevertheless, contemporary ligand design depends on either expensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing of whether a ligand can be integrated within the lattice or conservative heuristics that unduly limit the scope of ligand chemistries. Here, the structural determinants of stable ligand incorporation within Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) phase perovskites are established by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of over ten&#8208;thousand RP&#8208;phase perovskites and training of machine learning classifiers capable of predicting structural stability based solely on generalizable ligand features. The simulation results show near&#8208;perfect predictions of positive and negative literature examples, predict trade&#8208;offs between several ligand features and stability, and ultimately predict an inexhaustibly large 2D&#8208;compatible ligand design&#8208;space.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis with 63.5&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 100&#8201;% N&#8208;Selectivity via One&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling of carbon dioxide and nitrogen is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling via direct insertion of CO into N2 molecules is the intrinsic cause for the &#8764;100&#8201;% N&#8208;selectivity to urea.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis via coupling N2 and CO2 provides an effective route to mitigate energy crisis and close carbon footprint. However, the difficulty on breaking N&#8801;N is the main reason that caused low efficiencies for both electrocatalytic NH3 and urea synthesis, which is the bottleneck restricting their industrial applications. Herein, a new mechanism to overcome the inert of the nitrogen molecule was proposed by elongating N&#8801;N instead of breaking N&#8801;N to realize one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling in the process for urea production. We constructed a Zn&#8722;Mn diatomic catalyst with axial chloride coordination, Zn&#8722;Mn sites display high tolerance to CO poisoning and the Faradaic efficiency can even be increased to 63.5&#8201;%, which is the highest value that has ever been reported. More importantly, negligible N&#8801;N bond breakage effectively avoids the generation of ammonia as intermediates, therefore, the N&#8208;selectivity in the co&#8208;electrocatalytic system reaches100&#8201;% for urea synthesis. The previous cognition that electrocatalysts for urea synthesis must possess ammonia synthesis activity has been broken. Isotope&#8208;labelled measurements and Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validate that activation of N&#8722;N triple bond and nitrogen fixation activity arise from the one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling process of CO species with adsorbed N2 molecules.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Redox&#8208;Neutral Thiolation of Alkyl Halides with Thioformates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient manganese&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral thiolation of alkyl halides with thioformates was developed. This method could be extended to the late&#8208;stage thiolation of structurally complex natural products and pharmaceuticals by using easily synthesized thioformates as thiyl radical precursors.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as an important strategy to furnish thioethers; however, the dominant utilization of noble metal catalysts as well as the construction of challenging C(sp3)&#8722;S bonds by transition metal&#8208;catalysis remain highly problematic. Earth&#8208;abundant manganese has gathered increasing interest as an attractive catalyst for new reaction development; nevertheless, C(sp3)&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling reaction by manganese catalysis has not been reported. Herein, we disclose a highly efficient manganese&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral thiolation of a broad range of alkyl halides with thioformates as practical sulfuration agents. Strategically, employing easily synthesized thioformates as thiyl radical precursors allows access to various aryl and alkyl thioethers in good to excellent yields. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral method avoids the utilization of strong bases, external ligands, forcing reaction conditions, and stoichiometric manganese, thus presenting apparent advantages, such as broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and mild reaction conditions. Finally, the utilities of this method are also illustrated by downstream transformations and late&#8208;stage thiolation of structurally complex natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Design Principles for Maximizing Hole Utilization of Semiconductor Quantum Wires toward Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking small&#8208;molecule sacrificial electron donors as models, we found that increasing the driving force monotonically enhances hole&#8208;transfer kinetics of semiconductor quantum wires in an Auger&#8208;assisted model, while it affects the electron transfer parabolically in a Marcus model. This suggests three design principles to maximize hole utilization to boost solar hydrogen production and photo&#8208;oxidation of small molecules in quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals.







Abstract
Maximizing hole&#8208;transfer kinetics&#8212;usually a rate&#8208;determining step in semiconductor&#8208;based artificial photosynthesis&#8212;is pivotal for simultaneously enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar hydrogen production and hole utilization. However, this remains elusive yet as efforts are largely focused on optimizing the electron&#8208;involved half&#8208;reactions only by empirically employing sacrificial electron donors (SEDs) to consume the wasted holes. Using high&#8208;quality ZnSe quantum wires as models, we show that how hole&#8208;transfer processes in different SEDs affect their photocatalytic performances. We found that larger driving forces of SEDs monotonically enhance hole&#8208;transfer rates and photocatalytic performances by almost three orders of magnitude, a result conforming well with the Auger&#8208;assisted hole&#8208;transfer model in quantum&#8208;confined systems. Intriguingly, further loading Pt cocatalyts can yield either an Auger&#8208;assisted model or a Marcus inverted region for electron transfer, depending on the competing hole&#8208;transfer kinetics in SEDs.

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogen Generation and Exciplex Stimulated Emission in Photobasic Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;containing carbon dots may abstract a proton from the neighbouring water molecules (the so&#8208;called photobasic effect) at the excited state, leading to the significant promotion of photocatalytic performance. Moreover, due to the four&#8208;level energy diagram, the protonated carbon dot shows a net optical gain at the excited state, leading to stimulated emission, revealing a unique competitive mechanism for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach to generating sustainable hydrogen. However, the transport of photoelectrons to the catalyst sites, usually within ps&#8208;to&#8208;ns timescales, is much faster than proton delivery (&#8764;&#956;s), which limits the activity. Therefore, the acceleration of abstraction of protons from water molecules towards the catalytic sites to keep up with the electron transfer rate can significantly promote hydrogen production. The photobasic effect that is the increase in proton affinity upon excitation offers means to achieve this objective. Herein, we design photobasic carbon dots and identify that internal pyridinic N sites are intrinsically photobasic. This is supported by steady&#8208;state and ultrafast spectroscopic measurements that demonstrate proton abstraction within a few picoseconds of excitation. Furthermore, we show that in water, they form a unique four&#8208;level lasing scheme with optical gain and stimulated emission. The latter competes with photocatalysis, revealing a rather unique mechanism for efficiency loss, such that the stimulated emission can act as a toggle for photocatalytic activity. This provides additional means of controlling the photocatalytic process and helps the rational design of photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Photoactivated DNA Assembly and Disassembly for On&#8208;Demand Activation and Termination of cGAS&#8208;STING Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivated DNA assembly/disassembly strategy is developed to achieve spatiotemporally controlled regulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in living cells. The strategy capitalizes on the intrinsic preference of cGAS protein toward long double&#8208;stranded DNA and the programmability of DNA assembly, enabling on&#8208;demand activation and termination of cGAS&#8208;STING signaling.







Abstract
Despite significant progress in DNA self&#8208;assembly for interfacing with biology, spatiotemporally controlled regulation of biological process via in situ dynamic DNA assembly remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we report an optically triggered DNA assembly and disassembly strategy that enables on&#8208;demand activation and termination of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. In the design, an activatable DNA hairpin is engineered with a photocleavable group at defined site to modulate its self&#8208;assembly activity. Light activation induces the configurational switching and consequent self&#8208;assembly of the DNA hairpins to form long linear double&#8208;stranded structures, allowing to stimulate cGAS protein to synthesize 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) for STING stimulation. Furthermore, by endowing the pre&#8208;assembled DNA scaffold with a built&#8208;in photolysis feature, we demonstrate that the cGAS&#8208;STING stimulation can be efficiently terminated through remote photo&#8208;triggering, providing for the first time a route to control the temporal &#8220;dose&#8221; on&#8208;demand for such a stimulation. We envision that this regulation strategy will benefit and inspire both fundamental research and therapeutic applications regarding the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway.

         <title>Insights into Anion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Boost Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes in Pure&#8208;SiOx||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 Full Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;solvent interactions in Li&#8208;ion batteries were promoted in ether&#8208;based electrolyte by applying the small&#8208;anion&#8208;size LiNO3 and tetrahydrofuran with a high ratio of dipole moment to dielectric constant. The designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte showed optimized interphasial stability on the pure&#8208;SiOx anode and NMC811 cathode, thus enabling stable cycling performance of the pure&#8208;SiOx||NMC811 full cell over 500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Ether solvents with superior reductive stability promise excellent interphasial stability with high&#8208;capacity anodes while the limited oxidative resistance hinders their high&#8208;voltage operation. Extending the intrinsic electrochemical stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes to construct stable&#8208;cycling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is challenging but rewarding. Herein, the anion&#8208;solvent interactions were concerned as the key point to optimize the anodic stability of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes and an optimized interphase was realized on both pure&#8208;SiOx anodes and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes. Specifically, the small&#8208;anion&#8208;size LiNO3 and tetrahydrofuran with high dipole moment to dielectric constant ratio realized strengthened anion&#8208;solvent interactions, which enhance the oxidative stability of the electrolyte. The designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte enabled a stable cycling performance over 500&#8197;cycles in pure&#8208;SiOx||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell, demonstrating its superior practical prospects. This work provides new insight into the design of new electrolytes for emerging high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries through the regulation of interactions between species in electrolytes.

         <title>Functional Characterization and Cyclization Mechanism of a Diterpene Synthase Catalyzing the Skeleton Formation of Cephalotane&#8208;Type Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephalotene synthase (CsCTS), a new diterpene synthase from Cephalotaxus sinensis responsible for forming the core skeleton of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids, was functionally identified. The cyclization cascade was studied in depth through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis guided by molecular docking revealed the critical amino acid residues for the unique carbocation&#8208;driven cascade cyclization mechanism.







Abstract
CsCTS, a new diterpene synthase from Cephalotaxus sinensis responsible for forming cephalotene, the core skeleton of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids with a highly rigid 6/6/5/7 tetracyclic ring system, was functionally characterized. The stepwise cyclization mechanism is proposed mainly based on structural investigation of its derailment products, and further demonstrated through isotopic labeling experiments and density functional theory calculations. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation combined with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed the critical amino acid residues for the unique carbocation&#8208;driven cascade cyclization mechanism of CsCTS. Altogether, this study reports the discovery of the diterpene synthase that catalyzes the first committed step of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid biosynthesis and delineates its cyclization mechanism, laying the foundation to decipher and artificially construct the complete biosynthetic pathway of this type diterpenoids.

Abstract
Herein, we report a novel strategy for the modification of peptides based on the introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents&#8212;ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8212;onto peptides. These peptide&#8208;EBXs can be readily accessed, by both solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). They can be used to couple the peptide to other peptides or a protein through reaction with Cys, leading to thioalkynes in organic solvents and hypervalent iodine adducts in water buffer. Furthermore, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C&#8208;terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye and was also successful in an intramolecular fashion, leading to macrocyclic peptides with unprecedented crosslinking. A rigid linear aryl alkyne linker was essential to achieve high affinity for Keap1 at the Nrf2 binding site with potential protein&#8208;protein interaction inhibition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a novel strategy for the modification of peptides based on the introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents&#8212;ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8212;onto peptides. These peptide-EBXs can be readily accessed, by both solution- and solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). They can be used to couple the peptide to other peptides or a protein through reaction with Cys, leading to thioalkynes in organic solvents and hypervalent iodine adducts in water buffer. Furthermore, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C-terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye and was also successful in an intramolecular fashion, leading to macrocyclic peptides with unprecedented crosslinking. A rigid linear aryl alkyne linker was essential to achieve high affinity for Keap1 at the Nrf2 binding site with potential protein-protein interaction inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Reduction Cocatalysts: Critical Role of Metal Cocatalysts in Photocatalytic Oxidation of Methane with Water
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The function of metal cocatalysts that act as acceptor sites for photogenerated holes and dominate oxidation reactions was explored in the context of photocatalytic oxidation of CH4 with H2O. Beyond the conventional assumption in photocatalysis that the metal cocatalysts accumulate mostly photogenerated electrons and induce reduction reactions exclusively, they have impacts on the dynamics and selectivity of hole&#8208;driven oxidation of CH4.







Abstract
Environmentally sustainable and selective conversion of methane to valuable chemicals under ambient conditions is pivotal for the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic technology. However, due to the lack of microscopic knowledge about non&#8208;thermal methane conversion, controlling and modulating photocatalytic oxidation processes driven by photogenerated holes remain a challenge. Here, we report novel function of metal cocatalysts to accept photogenerated holes and dominate selectivity of methane oxidation, which is clearly beyond the conventional concept in photocatalysis that the metal cocatalysts loaded on the surfaces of semiconductor photocatalysts mostly capture photogenerated electrons and dominate reduction reactions exclusively. The novel photocatalytic role of metal cocatalysts was verified by operando molecular spectroscopy combined with real&#8208;time mass spectrometry for metal&#8208;loaded Ga2O3 model photocatalysts under methane and water vapor at ambient temperature and pressure. Our concept of metal cocatalysts that work as active sites for both photocatalytic oxidation and reduction provides a new understanding of photocatalysis and a solid basis for controlling non&#8208;thermal redox reactions by metal&#8208;cocatalyst engineering.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes: Hypervalent Iodine Meets High&#8208;Valent Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective trifluoromethylation of various substituted VBX reagents enables the synthesis of CF3&#8208;substituted alkenes. The reaction with high&#8208;valent copper can be performed upon thermal or light&#8208;mediated initiation giving access to trifluoromethylated alkenes with perfect retention of the double bond configuration. Easy upscaling, the visible light version, and product modifications further highlight the versatility of the method.







Abstract
The first trifluoromethylation of vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) is reported herein. The synthetic method is based on the use of bench&#8208;stable, high&#8208;valent copper(III) species, and the reaction can be initiated under thermal conditions and/or irradiation (365&#8197;nm) giving access to trifluoromethylated alkenes in a stereoselective fashion. Various VBX reagents derived from tyrosine, cysteine, small peptides, thiols and amides can be used as precursors. The obtained alkenes could be further functionalized by reduction or epoxidation of the trifluoromethylated double bond. Furthermore, the method could be applied in a large&#8208;scale batch/flow synthesis and could be conducted under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion in a Diazo&#8208;Functionalized Compound with Switchable Solid&#8208;State Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The switchable solid&#8208;state behavior of diazo&#8208;I is described. Dramatically different and fully reversible thermal expansion (TE) behaviors are obtained on either side of a phase transition. Moderate, positive TE along all axes occurs at low temperature and two&#8208;dimensional, area zero TE coupled with colossal, positive TE occurs at high temperature.







Abstract
Achieving substantial anisotropic thermal expansion (TE) in solid&#8208;state materials is challenging as most materials undergo volumetric expansion upon heating. Here, we describe colossal, anisotropic TE in crystals of an organic compound functionalized with two azo groups. Interestingly, the material exhibits distinct and switchable TE behaviors within different temperature regions. At high temperature, two&#8208;dimensional, area zero TE and colossal, positive linear TE (&#945;=211&#8197;MK&#8722;1) are attained due to dynamic motion, while at low temperature, moderate positive TE occurs in all directions. Investigation of the solid&#8208;state motion showed the change in enthalpy and entropy are quite different in the two temperature regions and solid&#8208;state NMR experiments support motion in the solid. Cycling experiments demonstrate that the solid&#8208;state motions and TE behaviors are completely reversible. These results reveal strategies for designing significant anisotropic and switchable behaviors in solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Perovskite Films Regulation via Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymer Network for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional elastomer with abundant hydrogen bonds and carbonyl groups was designed and successfully incorporated into perovskite film. The multiple chemical bonding interactions between the elastomer and perovskite lead to high&#8208;quality perovskite film and efficient perovskite solar cells with improved stability and reduced lead leakage.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low cost. However, their long&#8208;term stability, mechanical durability, and environmental risks are still unable to meet practical needs. To overcome these issues, we designed a multifunctional elastomer with abundant hydrogen bonds and carbonyl groups. The chemical bonding between polymer and perovskite could increase the growth activation energy of perovskite film and promote the preferential growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Owing to the low defect density and gradient energy&#8208;level alignment, the corresponding device exhibited a champion efficiency of 23.10&#8201;%. Furthermore, due to the formation of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network in the perovskite film, the target devices demonstrated excellent air stability and enhanced flexibility for the flexible PSCs. More importantly, the polymer network could coordinate with Pb2+ ions, immobilizing lead atoms to reduce their release into the environment. This strategy paves the way for the industrialization of high&#8208;performance flexible PSCs.

         <title>Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation for the Chemical Synthesis of Mirror&#8208;Image Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation (BISIAL) method was described for the synthesis of membrane&#8208;associated D&#8208;proteins. The ligation of split intein&#8208;modified D&#8208;peptides proceeds smoothly at micromolar (&#956;M) concentrations under strongly chaotropic conditions (8.0&#8197;M urea), and the subsequent removal of the backbone modification groups affords the desired D&#8208;proteins without leaving any &#8220;ligation scar&#8221; on the products.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;associated D&#8208;proteins are an important class of synthetic molecules needed for D&#8208;peptide drug discovery, but their chemical synthesis using canonical ligation methods such as native chemical ligation is often hampered by the poor solubility of their constituent peptide segments. Here, we describe a Backbone&#8208;Installed Split Intein&#8208;Assisted Ligation (BISIAL) method for the synthesis of these proteins, wherein the native L&#8208;forms of the N&#8208; and C&#8208;intein fragments of the unique consensus&#8208;fast (Cfa) (i.e. L&#8211;CfaN and L&#8211;CfaC) are separately installed onto the two D&#8208;peptide segments to be ligated via a removable backbone modification. The ligation proceeds smoothly at micromolar (&#956;M) concentrations under strongly chaotropic conditions (8.0&#8197;M urea), and the subsequent removal of the backbone modification groups affords the desired D&#8208;proteins without leaving any &#8220;ligation scar&#8221; on the products. The effectiveness and practicality of the BISIAL method are exemplified by the synthesis of the D&#8208;enantiomers of the extracellular domains of T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC). The BISIAL method further expands the chemical protein synthesis ligation toolkit and provides practical access to challenging D&#8208;protein targets.

     alt="Backbone-Installed Split Intein-Assisted Ligation for the Chemical Synthesis of Mirror-Image Proteins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Backbone-Installed Split Intein-Assisted Ligation (BISIAL) method was described for the synthesis of membrane-associated D-proteins. The ligation of split intein-modified D-peptides proceeds smoothly at micromolar (&#956;M) concentrations under strongly chaotropic conditions (8.0&#8197;M urea), and the subsequent removal of the backbone modification groups affords the desired D-proteins without leaving any &#8220;ligation scar&#8221; on the products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membrane-associated D-proteins are an important class of synthetic molecules needed for D-peptide drug discovery, but their chemical synthesis using canonical ligation methods such as native chemical ligation is often hampered by the poor solubility of their constituent peptide segments. Here, we describe a &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;ackbone-&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;nstalled &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;plit &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;ntein-&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;ssisted &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;igation (BISIAL) method for the synthesis of these proteins, wherein the native L-forms of the N- and C-intein fragments of the unique consensus-fast (Cfa) (i.e. L&#8211;Cfa&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; and L&#8211;Cfa&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) are separately installed onto the two D-peptide segments to be ligated via a removable backbone modification. The ligation proceeds smoothly at micromolar (&#956;M) concentrations under strongly chaotropic conditions (8.0&#8197;M urea), and the subsequent removal of the backbone modification groups affords the desired D-proteins without leaving any &#8220;ligation scar&#8221; on the products. The effectiveness and practicality of the BISIAL method are exemplified by the synthesis of the D-enantiomers of the extracellular domains of T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC). The BISIAL method further expands the chemical protein synthesis ligation toolkit and provides practical access to challenging D-protein targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru&#8722;FeNi Alloy Heterojunctions on Lignin&#8208;derived Carbon as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel lignin&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;supported Ru&#8722;FeNi@NLC heterojunction catalyst for water electrolysis was proposed. The synergistic interaction between the heterogeneous structure and the lignin&#8208;derived carbon layer produced a total water decomposition interface adjustment of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.48&#8197;V, which reduced the energy barrier and improved the reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Rational design of efficient, stable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a key challenge to realize green hydrogen production via electrolytic water splitting. Herein, Ru nanoparticles and FeNi alloy heterojunction catalyst (Ru&#8722;FeNi@NLC) encapsulated via lignin&#8208;derived carbon was prepared by self&#8208;assembly precipitation and in situ pyrolysis. The designed catalyst displays excellent performance at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with low overpotentials of 36&#8197;mV for HER and 198&#8197;mV for OER, and only needs 1.48&#8197;V for overall water splitting. Results and DFT calculations show the unique N&#8208;doped lignin&#8208;derived carbon layer and Ru&#8722;FeNi heterojunction contribute to optimized electronic structure for enhancing electron transfer, balanced free energy of reactants and intermediates in the sorption/desorption process, and significantly reduced reaction energy barrier for the HER and OER rate&#8208;determining steps, thus improved reaction kinetics. This work provides a new in situ pyrolysis doping strategy based on renewable biomass for the construction of highly active, stable and cost&#8208;effective catalysts.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Nanoribbons with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>

Two N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons featuring N&#8208;heterocycles, fused pentagons, and bulky solubilizing groups are prepared, showing the largest molecular length of 33.8&#8197;&#197;, a high electron affinity, and a good chemical stability.They are demonstrated to be an excellent material for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications, achieving the highest nonlinear extinction coefficient of 374&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, superior to the classical material C60 (153&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1).







Abstract
Two novel N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons (NNNR&#8208;1 and NNNR&#8208;2) featuring multiple fused N&#8208;heterocycles and bulky solubilizing groups were prepared via bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis. NNNR&#8208;2 achieves a total molecular length of 33.8&#8197;&#197;, which represents the longest soluble N&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbon reported to date. The pentagon subunits and doping of N atoms in NNNR&#8208;1 and NNNR&#8208;2 have successfully regulated their electronic properties, achieving high electron affinity and good chemical stability enabled by the nonalternant conjugation and electronic effects. When applied a laser pulse of 532&#8197;nm, the 13&#8208;rings nanoribbon NNNR&#8208;2 shows outstanding nonlinear optical (NLO) responses, with the nonlinear extinction coefficient of 374&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, much higher than those of NNNR&#8208;1 (96&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1) and the well&#8208;known NLO material C60 (153&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1). Our findings indicate that the N&#8208;doping of nonalternant nanoribbons is an effective strategy to access another type of excellent material system for high&#8208;performance NLO applications, which can be extended to construct numerous heteroatom&#8208;doped nonalternant nanoribbons with fine&#8208;tunable electronic properties.

         <title>Group&#8197;14 Elements Hetero&#8208;Difunctionalizations via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reductive protocol for hetero&#8208;difunctionalization with group 14 elements via electrochemistry is described. The cascade reaction proceeded smoothly with the diverse chlorosilanes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides. Good chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities were achieved. This protocol could be extended to germanyl&#8208; and stannylalkylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes, showing its generality and versatility.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of unsaturated bonds plays a vital role in the enrichment of molecular complexity. While various catalytic methods for alkene and alkyne difunctionalization have been developed in recent years, hetero&#8208;functionalization the introduction of two different atoms has been less explored. This is mainly due to the challenges associated with achieving high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity, especially when adding two similar atoms from the same group across unsaturated bonds. In this study, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, three&#8208;component reductive protocol for group&#8197;14 element hetero&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes using electrochemistry. This new method is mild, selective, and general, allowing for the silyl&#8208;, germanyl&#8208;, and stannyl&#8208;alkylation of enynes. Various chlorosilanes as well as chlorogermans, and chlorostannanes can be successfully used in combination with aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;enynes and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides in the electroreductive coupling.

         <title>Single&#8208;Nitrogen Atom Incorporation into B=B Bond via the N=N Bond Splitting of Diazo Compound and Diazirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential ring formation and ring opening strategy starting from diboraazabutenyne allows access to the first triboraazabutenynes with an extremely polarized asymmetrical B=B bond. This compound completely splits the N=N bond of diazo compound and diazirine, whereby one nitrogen atom is incorporated into the B=B moiety leading to a neutral 1,3&#8208;diboraazaallene.







Abstract
Triboraazabutenyne 3 is synthesized by the reaction of diboraazabutenyne 1 with aryl boron dibromide followed by the reduction. The ligand exchange to replace phosphine on the terminal sp2 B atom with carbene furnishes 4. 11B NMR, solid&#8208;state structures, and computational studies disclose that 3 and 4 feature the extremely polarized B=B bond. 4 readily splits the N=N bond of both diazo compound and diazirine under ambient conditions, whereby one nitrogen atom is incorporated into the B=B moiety leading to a neutral diboraazaallene 6. The mechanism of the reaction between 4 and diazo compound is extensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as well as the isolation of an intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;Triboraazabutenyne &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is synthesized by the reaction of diboraazabutenyne &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with aryl boron dibromide followed by the reduction. The ligand exchange to replace phosphine on the terminal &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/sup&gt; B atom with carbene furnishes &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B NMR, solid-state structures, and computational studies disclose that &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; feature the extremely polarized B=B bond. &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; readily splits the N=N bond of both diazo compound and diazirine under ambient conditions, whereby one nitrogen atom is incorporated into the B=B moiety leading to a neutral diboraazaallene &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;. The mechanism of the reaction between &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and diazo compound is extensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as well as the isolation of an intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross Relaxation Channel Tailored Temperature Response in Er3+&#8208;rich Upconversion Nanophosphor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100&#8208;fold enhancement of upconversion emission is achieved in cryogenic Er3+&#8208;rich nanosystems. The role of temperature in emission is quantitatively revealed, which obeys an exponential relationship.







Abstract
Recently high doping of lanthanide ions (till 100&#8201;%) is realized unprecedentedly in nanostructured upconversion (UC) phosphors. However, oddly enough, this significant breakthrough did not result in a corresponding UC enhancement at ambient temperature, which hinders the otherwise very interesting applications of these materials in various fields. In this work, taking the Er3+&#8208;rich UC nanosystem as an example, we confirm unambiguously that the phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation (CR) is the culprit. More importantly, combining the theoretical modeling and experiments, the precise roles of different CR channels on UC energy loss are quantitatively revealed. As a result, lowering the temperature can exponentially enhance the relevant UC luminescence by more than two orders of magnitude. Our comprehension will play an important role in promoting the UC performance and further application of high doping rare earth materials. As a proof of concept, an Er3+&#8208;rich core/multi&#8208;shell nanophosphor is exploited which demonstrates the great potential of our finding in the field of ultra&#8208;sensitive temperature sensing.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Donors&#8211;Acceptors Interaction Enhancing Electrocatalytic Activity of Metal&#8208;Organic Polymers for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraaza[14]annulene&#8208;based polymer nanocomposites were precisely prepared via electron&#8208;donors/acceptors interaction for the efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Systematic in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy and square wave voltammetry show that the high ORR kinetics of the optimal catalyst (CoTAA&#8722;Cl@GR) arise from the relatively high accessible site density and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism.







Abstract
Catalysts with metal&#8208;Nx sites have long been considered as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the accurate structure&#8208;property correlations of these active sites remain debatable. Report here is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept method to construct 1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraaza[14]annulene (TAA)&#8208;based polymer nanocomposites with well&#8208;managed electronic microenvironment via electron&#8208;donors/acceptors interaction of altering electron&#8208;withdrawing &#946;&#8208;site substituents. DFT calculation proves the optimal &#8722;Cl substituted catalyst (CoTAA&#8722;Cl@GR) tailored the key OH* intermediate interaction with Co&#8722;N4 sites under the d&#8208;orbital regulation, hence reaching the top of ORR performance with excellent turnover frequency (0.49 e s&#8722;1 site&#8722;1). The combination of in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy and variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry techniques contribute the great ORR kinetics of CoTAA&#8722;Cl@GR to the relatively high accessible site density (7.71&#215;1019&#8197;site&#8201;g&#8722;1) and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism. This work provides theoretical guidance for rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ORR and beyond.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Triggered Structural Defects in Au44 Homologues Boost Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected nanocluster homologues is demonstrated, with a unified formula of Au44(PPh3)n(TBBT)28&#8722;2n (n=0&#8211;2) and similar cuboctahedral interpenetrating structures. The structural defects at the bottom of the Au44(PPh3)(TBBT)26 nanocluster facilitate electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO by lowering the free energy for the *COOH formation.







Abstract
The systematic induction of structural defects at the atomic level is crucial to metal nanocluster research because it endows cluster&#8208;based catalysts with highly reactive centers and allows for a comprehensive investigation of viable reaction pathways. Herein, by substituting neutral phosphine ligands for surface anionic thiolate ligands, we establish that one or two Au3 triangular units can be successfully introduced into the double&#8208;stranded helical kernel of Au44(TBBT)28, where TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzenethiolate, resulting in the formation of two atomically precise defective Au44 nanoclusters. Along with the regular face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) nanocluster, the first series of mixed&#8208;ligand cluster homologues is identified, with a unified formula of Au44(PPh3)n(TBBT)28&#8722;2n (n=0&#8211;2). The Au44(PPh3)(TBBT)26 nanocluster having major structural defects at the bottom of the fcc lattice demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction to CO. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the active site near the defects significantly lowers the free energy for the *COOH formation, the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole catalytic process.

         <title>Monodisperse Adducts&#8208;Induced Homogeneous Nucleation Towards High&#8208;Quality Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) changes the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct and constructs a well&#8208;dispersed Sn&#8208;based precursor solution, which facilitates uniform distribution of nucleation sites and delays crystallization process, resulting in dense and uniform Sn&#8208;based perovskite films over large area. Ultimately, HMPA&#8208;incorporated device delivers a superior efficiency of 13.46&#8201;%.







Abstract
The classic solvent system can't sufficiently separate one&#8208;dimensional edge&#8208;sharing SnI2 crystals in solution, which severely restricts the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;based perovskite film. Herein, a strong Lewis base (hexamethylphosphoramide, HMPA) has been introduced to coordinate Sn2+ to modulate solvation behaviours on perovskite precursor and regulate crystallization kinetics. The large molecular volume of HMPA and stronger bind energy of SnI2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2HMPA (&#8722;0.595&#8197;eV vs &#8722;0.118&#8197;eV for SnI2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMSO) change the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct, which contributes to uniform nucleation sites and prolongs crystal growth process. Delightfully, a fully&#8208;covered perovskite film is formed on the large&#8208;area substrate and tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells processed with HMPA exhibit an excellent efficiency of 13.46&#8201;%. This research provides novel insights and directions for the solution preparation of smooth and uniform large&#8208;area tin&#8208;based perovskite film.

         <title>Visible Light and Microwave&#8208;Mediated Rapid Trapping and Release of Singlet Oxygen Using a Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthracyl coordination polymer is able to self&#8208;sensitize and rapidly trap 1O2 in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photooxidation reaction upon exposure to visible light. 1O2 is efficiently and rapidly released through microwave irradiation. This process is accompanied by reversible enhancement and attenuation of fluorescence. Fluorescent oxygen sensing regulated by visible light and microwave irradiation has been demonstrated for the first time.







Abstract
Due to its high reactivity and oxidative strength, singlet oxygen (1O2) is used in a variety of fields including organic synthesis, biomedicine, photodynamic therapy and materials science. Despite its importance, the controlled trapping and release of 1O2 is extremely challenging. Herein, we describe a one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer, CP1, which upon irradiation with visible light, transforms 3O2 (triplet oxygen) to 1O2. CP1 consists of CdII centers bridged by 9,10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene ligands which undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with 1O2, resulting in the generation of CP1&#8722;1O2. Using microwave irradiation, CP1&#8722;1O2 displays efficient release of 1O2, over a period of 30&#8197;s. In addition, CP1 exhibits enhanced fluorescence and has an oxygen detection limit of 97.4&#8197;ppm. Theoretical calculations reveal that the fluorescence behaviour is dominated by unique through&#8208;space conjugation. In addition to describing a highly efficient approach for the trapping and controlled release of 1O2, using coordination polymers, this work also provides encouragement for the development of efficient fluorescent oxygen sensors.

         <title>Crystalline Nanoparticles of Water&#8208;Soluble Covalent Basket Cages (CBCs) for Encapsulation of Anticancer Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent basket cages (CBCs) are, in size, similar to small proteins with a large inner space structured to hold four bioactive molecules. These tetrahedral polyvalent hosts assemble into crystalline nanoparticles capable of removing doxorubicin and irinotecan from water by inclusion complexation. Being biocompatible, CBCs hold promise for developing nanoantidotes for the rapid sequestration of toxicants from complex biological environments.







Abstract
We herein describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and biocompatibility of novel covalent basket cage CBC&#8208;11, composed of four molecular baskets linked to four trivalent aromatic amines through amide groups. The cage is tetrahedral in shape and similar in size to small proteins (Mw=8637&#8197;g/mol) with a spacious nonpolar interior for accommodating multiple guests. While 24&#8197;carboxylates at the outer surface of CBC&#8208;11 render it soluble in aqueous phosphate buffer (PBS) at pH=7.0, the amphiphilic nature prompts its assembly into nanoparticles (d=250&#8197;nm, DLS). Cryo&#8208;TEM examination of nanoparticles revealed their crystalline nature with wafer&#8208;like shapes and hexagonally arranged cages. Nanoparticulate CBC&#8208;11 traps anticancer drugs irinotecan and doxorubicin, with each cage binding up to four drug molecules in a non&#8208;cooperative manner. The inclusion complexation resulted in nanoparticles growing in size and precipitating. In media containing mammalian cells (HCT&#8197;116, human colon carcinoma), the IC50 value of CBC&#8208;11 was above 100&#8197;&#956;M. While this work presents the first example of a large covalent organic cage operating in water at the physiological pH and forming crystalline nanoparticles, it also demonstrates its biocompatibility and potential to act as a polyvalent binder of drugs for their sequestration or delivery.

         <title>2D MOF&#8208;assisted Pyrolysis&#8208;displacement&#8208;alloying Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy Alloy Nanoparticles Library for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile 2D MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;displacement&#8208;alloying route was developed to successfully synthesize a series of binary, ternary and even high&#8208;entropy nanoparticles. As a proof of utility, the obtained Co0.2Ru0.7Pt0.1 exhibits apparent activity and durability for hydrogen oxidation reaction. This work provides an attractive synthesis method to construct high&#8208;performance multimetallic nanomaterials for various applications.







Abstract
Multimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have received considerable attention in various applications due to their compositional variability and exceptional properties. However, the complexity of both the general synthesis and structure&#8211;activity relationships remain the long&#8208;standing challenges in this field. Herein, we report a versatile 2D MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;displacement&#8208;alloying route to successfully synthesize a series of binary, ternary and even high&#8208;entropy NPs that are uniformly dispersed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (PNC NSs). As a proof of utility, the obtained Co0.2Ru0.7Pt0.1/PNC NSs exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity and durability with a record&#8208;high mass specific kinetic current of 1.84&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at the overpotential of 50&#8197;mV, which is approximately 11.5&#8197;times higher than that of the Pt benchmark. Both experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the addition of Pt engenders a phase transition in CoRu alloys from hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) to face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure. The elevated reactivity of the resulted ternary alloy can be attributed to the optimized adsorption of hydrogen intermediate and the decreased reaction barrier for water formation. This study opens a new avenue for the development of highly efficient alloy NPs with various compositions and functions.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;driven Reduction of CO2 to Acetate with 100&#8201;% Selectivity by SnS Nanobelt Piezocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We substantiate the potential to utilize mechanical energy to piezocatalytically convert CO2 into C2 products, which is unprecedented. Tin(II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts served as piezocatalysts for the first time to convert CO2 into acetate under periodic ultrasonic waves, achieving 100&#8201;% selectivity and a yield up to 2.21&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is the highest among reported studies.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 chemicals such as acetate with high selectivity and efficiency is a critical issue in renewable energy storage. Herein, for the first time we present a vibration&#8208;driven piezocatalysis with tin(II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts for conversion of CO2 to acetate with 100&#8201;% selectivity, and the highest production rate (2.21&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) compared with reported catalysts. Mechanism analysis reveal that the polarized charges triggered by periodic mechanical vibration promote the adsorption and activation of CO2. The electron transfer can be facilitated due to built&#8208;in electric field, decreased band gap and work function of SnS under stress. Remarkably, reduced distance between active sites leads to charge enrichment on Sn sites, promoting the C&#8722;C coupling, reducing the energy barriers of the rate determining step. It puts forward a bran&#8208;new strategy for converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 products with efficient, low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly piezocatalysis utilizing mechanical energy.

Mechanism analysis reveal that the polarized charges triggered by periodic mechanical vibration promote the adsorption and activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The electron transfer can be facilitated due to built-in electric field, decreased band gap and work function of SnS under stress. Remarkably, reduced distance between active sites leads to charge enrichment on Sn sites, promoting the C&#8722;C coupling, reducing the energy barriers of the rate determining step. It puts forward a bran-new strategy for converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into high-value C2 products with efficient, low-cost and environment-friendly piezocatalysis utilizing mechanical energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of the O&#8208;antigen of A. baumannii ATCC 17961 Using Long&#8208;Range Levulinoyl Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described the first synthesis of the pentasaccharide and decasaccharide of the A.&#8197;baumannii ATCC 17961 O&#8208;antigen for the development of a synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine against A.&#8197;baumannii infection. We found that long&#8208;range levulinoyl group assistance via hydrogen bonding strikingly improves the &#946;&#8208;selectivity of the glycosylation. The proposed mechanism was investigated experimentally and via DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we described the first synthesis of the pentasaccharide and decasaccharide of the A.&#8197;baumannii ATCC 17961 O&#8208;antigen for developing a synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine against A.&#8197;baumannii infection. The efficient synthesis of the rare sugar 2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;glucuronate was achieved using our recently introduced organocatalytic glycosylation method. We found, for the first time, that long&#8208;range levulinoyl group participation via a hydrogen bond can result in a significantly improved &#946;&#8208;selectivity in glycosylations. This solves the stereoselectivity problem of highly branched galactose acceptors. The proposed mechanism was supported by control experiments and DFT computations. Benefiting from the long&#8208;range levulinoyl group participation strategy, the pentasaccharide donor and acceptor were obtained via an efficient [2+1+2] one&#8208;pot glycosylation method and were used for the target decasaccharide synthesis.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;Selective Alkyne Hydroamination and Hydrophenoxylation using Tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;Sulfanyl Alkynes under Superbasic, Naked Anion Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
A methodology involving &#946;&#8208;regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective alkyne hydroamination by using SF4&#8208;alkynes under superbasic, naked anion conditions is disclosed. The reaction is compatible with a wide variety of N&#8208;heterocycles and selectively furnishes Z&#8208;enamines. Moreover, this method was extended to hydrophenoxylation transformations to provide SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl ethers in high yields.







Abstract
Alkyne hydroamination is an effective approach for the production of enamines and enamine&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles. However, stereoselectivity control is a considerable challenge in this reaction because of the electronic repulsion between an incoming nitrogen lone pair and the alkyne &#960;&#8208;system. Herein, we propose a methodology involving &#946;&#8208;regio&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective alkyne hydroamination by using tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl (SF4) alkynes under superbasic, naked anion conditions. The reaction is compatible with a wide variety of N&#8208;heterocycles, including indoles, carbazoles, pyrazoles, and imidazoles, and selectively furnishes SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl enamines with &#946;&#8208;regioselectively. Moreover, the method can be extended to the &#946;&#8208; and Z&#8208;controlled, base&#8208;mediated alkyne hydrophenoxylation with phenols to provide SF4&#8208;linked Z&#8208;vinyl ethers in high yields. As the SF4 unit has attracted attention as a bioisostere for alkynes, p&#8208;benzenes, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) groups, and cubanes in medicinal chemistry, this chemistry represents an effective approach to creating novel drug candidates incorporating SF4&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Sustainable and High&#8208;Rate Electrosynthesis of Nitrogen Fertilizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrosynthesis emerges as an appealing sustainable route to converting greenhouse gas (CO2) and waste nitrates by renewable energies into value&#8208;added fertilizers. We demonstrate an organic Cu&#8208;based salphen complex as an economic catalyst for efficient production of urea and ammonia. The improved performance by tuning functionalization of molecules provides an efficient and simple strategy for design of future electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The conventional industrial production of nitrogen&#8208;containing fertilizers, such as urea and ammonia, relies heavily on energy&#8208;intensive processes, accounting for approximately 3&#8201;% of global annual CO2 emissions. Herein, we report a sustainable electrocatalytic approach that realizes direct and selective synthesis of urea and ammonia from co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrates under ambient conditions. With the assistance of a copper (Cu)&#8208;based salphen organic catalyst, outstanding urea (3.64&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1) and ammonia (9.73&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1) yield rates are achieved, in addition to a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 57.9&#177;3&#8201;% for the former. This work proposes an appealing sustainable route to converting greenhouse gas and waste nitrates by renewable energies into value&#8208;added fertilizers.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Anchored Covalent Organic Frameworks@Amino&#8208;Modified Ti3C2Tx MXene on Nylon 6 Film for High&#8208;Performance Deformable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design high&#8208;performance deformable supercapacitors (D&#8208;SCs) based on porous and active covalent organic frameworks@amino&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx deposited on decorated nylon 6 film. The hierarchical film electrode exhibits admirable accessible surface, faster electronic migration and rich faradaic active sites. The resultant D&#8208;SCs deliver excellent energy density, deformation stability (bending, stretching and folding states) and practical applications.







Abstract
Designing deformable supercapacitors (D&#8208;SCs) that have robust skeleton and smoothly active channels for charges kinetic migration and faradic storage are highly crucial for wearable systems. Here, we develop the high&#8208;performance D&#8208;SCs made of the covalent organic frameworks(COF)@amino&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx deposited on decorated nylon 6 (DPA) film (COF@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/DPA) via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabrication. The hierarchical COF@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/DPA exhibits admirable specific capacitance, rate performance and cycling stability in three&#8208;electrode system due to the superior H+ storage property and large interfacial charge transfer clarified by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state D&#8208;SCs deliver favourable energy density and practical energy&#8208;supply applications. Particularly, the solid&#8208;state D&#8208;SCs present high deformable stabilities, with regard to 80.7, 80.6 and 83.4&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 bending cycles, 2000 stretching cycles and 5000 folding cycles, separately.

Particularly, the solid-state D-SCs present high deformable stabilities, with regard to 80.7, 80.6 and 83.4&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 bending cycles, 2000 stretching cycles and 5000 folding cycles, separately.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Smart Deoxyribozyme&#8208;Programmable Catalytic DNA Circuit for High&#8208;Contrast MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;responsive DNAzyme&#8208;powered entropy&#8208;driven reaction circuit (Dz&#8208;EDR) was proposed for selective and efficient microRNA imaging with high signal gain and ultralow background. Only under the stimulation of endogenous cancerous mRNA, the DNAzyme amplifier was activated to liberate EDR reactants (fuel strands) for powering the downstream EDR&#8208;amplified detection of target microRNA.







Abstract
Synthetic catalytic DNA circuits have been recognized as a promising signal amplification toolbox for sensitive intracellular imaging, yet their selectivity and efficiency are always constrained by uncontrolled off&#8208;site signal leakage and inefficient on&#8208;site circuitry activation. Thus, the endogenously controllable on&#8208;site exposure/activation of DNA circuits is highly desirable for achieving the selective imaging of live cells. Herein, an endogenously activated DNAzyme strategy was facilely integrated with a catalytic DNA circuit for guiding the selective and efficient microRNA imaging in vivo. To prevent the off&#8208;site activation, the circuitry constitute was initially caged without sensing functions, which could be selectively liberated by DNAzyme amplifier to guarantee the high&#8208;contrast microRNA imaging in target cells. This intelligent on&#8208;site modulation strategy can tremendously expand these molecularly engineered circuits in biological systems.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P Alkenylphosphonamidates through Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;P Coupling of Phosphoramidites and Alkenyl Halides</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic alkenylphosphonamidates can be accessed in high yield and stereoselectivity through a chemo&#8208; and diastereodivergent Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;P coupling of readily available BINOL&#8208;based phosphoramidites and alkenyl halides. The reaction showed a broad scope and the chiral alkenylphosphonamidates proved to be versatile synthetic handles for the divergent synthesis of functionalized chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P organophosphorus compounds.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic compounds are widely used as ligands in asymmetric catalysis and are present in a myriad of bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals. Yet, their stereocontrolled preparation remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel strategy towards versatile chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P alkenylphosphonamidates through a one&#8208;pot Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;P coupling/diastereoselective hydrolysis of readily available phosphoramidites and alkenyl halides. Remarkably, a chemo&#8208; and diastereodivergent behavior was observed upon subtle changes in the reaction conditions. Additionally, selective derivatizations of chiral alkenylphosphonamidates demonstrate their versatility as building blocks for the synthesis of structurally diverse P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Metal Anodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C through Eutectic Solvation Sheath in Chlorine&#8208;functionalized Eutectic Electrolytes with 1,3&#8208;Dioxolane</title>

         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;functionalized eutectic electrolyte was proposed by exploiting Cl anion&#8208;induced eutectic interaction with zinc (Zn) acetate solutions. This novel eutectic liquid shows high affinity to collaborate with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane for the construction of a unique eutectic solvation sheath, which contributes to the ideal regulation of Zn&#8208;solvating structure and ultra&#8208;stabilization of Zn anode at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The brain&#8208;storm of designing low&#8208;cost and commercialized eutectic electrolytes for zinc (Zn)&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage (ZEES) remains unresolved and attractive, especially when implementing it at low temperatures. Here, we report an appealing layout of advancing chlorine&#8208;functionalized eutectic (Cl&#8208;FE) electrolytes via exploiting Cl anion&#8208;induced eutectic interaction with Zn acetate solutions. This novel eutectic liquid shows high affinity to collaborate with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and is prone to constitute Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes with a unique inner/outer eutectic solvation sheath for the better regulation of Zn&#8208;solvating neighboring and reconstruction of H&#8208;bonding. The side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% can be achieved over 1000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with Zn//Cu setups. By prototyping scale&#8208;up Zn&#8208;ion pouch cells using the optimal eutectic liquid of 3ZnOAc1.2Cl1.8&#8208;DOL, we obtain improved electrochemical properties at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a high capacitance of 203.9&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.02&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in a range of 0.20&#8211;1.90&#8197;V and long&#8208;term cycling ability with 95.3&#8201;% capacitance retention at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 3,000&#8197;cycles. Overall, the proposal of ideal Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes guides the design of sub&#8208;zero and endurable aqueous ZEES devices and beyond.

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Neutral Ceramidase in Diabetic Foot Ulcers with an Optimized Substrate and Chemoenzymatic Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a bacteria&#8208;specific substrate and photoaffinity&#8208;based probes were designed for detecting secreted ceramidase from diabetic foot ulcer microbiota. The combination of these biochemical tools together with mass spectrometry analysis and 16S full&#8208;length sequencing highlighted a potential role of bacterial ceramidase in exacerbating wound infection.







Abstract
Ceramidases (CDases) are important in controlling skin barrier integrity by regulating ceramide composition and affording downstream signal molecules. While the functions of epidermal CDases are known, roles of neutral CDases secreted by skin&#8208;residing microbes are undefined. Here, we developed a one&#8208;step fluorogenic substrate, S&#8208;B, for specific detection of bacterial CDase activity and inhibitor screening. We identified a non&#8208;hydrolyzable substrate mimic, C6, as the best hit. Based on C6, we designed a photoaffinity probe, JX&#8208;1, which efficiently detects bacterial CDases. Using JX&#8208;1, we identified endogenous low&#8208;abundance PaCDase in a P. aeruginosa monoculture and in a mixed skin bacteria culture. Harnessing both S&#8208;B and JX&#8208;1, we found that CDase activity positively correlates with the relative abundance of P. aeruginosa and is negatively associated with wound area reduction in clinical diabetic foot ulcer patient samples. Overall, our study demonstrates that bacterial CDases are important regulators of skin ceramides and potentially play a role in wound healing.

         <title>Palladium and Ruthenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Porous Ionic Polymers for Acetylene Dialkoxycarbonylation: Synergetic Effects Stabilize the Active Site and Increase CO Adsorption</title>

A heterogeneous Pd1&#8722;Ru1 dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms catalyst supported on porous ionic polymers was fabricated via a wet impregnation method and applied in acetylene dialkoxycarbonylation. The molecular structure of the Pd1&#8722;Ru1 catalyst was determined to be [P]+&#8722;[PdI3&#8722;I&#8722;RuCl2(CO)3]&#8722;, with a synergetic effect between the neighboring Pd1 and Ru1 single sites elevating the overall activity and stabilizing the active site.







Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts usually suffer from poor stability, thereby limiting industrial applications. Dual Pd1&#8722;Ru1 single&#8208;atom&#8208;sites supported on porous ionic polymers (Pd1&#8722;Ru1/PIPs) were constructed using a wetness impregnation method. The two isolated metal species in the form of a binuclear complex were immobilized on the cationic framework of PIPs through ionic bonds. Compared to the single Pd&#8208; or Ru&#8208;site catalyst, the dual single&#8208;atom system exhibits higher activity with 98&#8201;% acetylene conversion and near 100&#8201;% selectivity to dialkoxycarbonylation products, as well as better cycling stability for ten cycles without obvious decay. Based on DFT calculations, it was found that the single&#8208;Ru site exhibited a strong CO adsorption energy of &#8722;1.6&#8197;eV, leading to an increase in the local CO concentration of the catalyst. Notably, the Pd1&#8722;Ru1/PIPs catalyst had a much lower energy barrier of 2.49&#8197;eV compared to 3.87&#8197;eV of Pd1/PIPs for the rate&#8208;determining step. The synergetic effect between neighboring single sites Pd1 and Ru1 not only enhanced the overall activity, but also stabilized PdII active sites. The discovery of synergetic effects between single sites can deepen our understanding of single&#8208;site catalysts at the molecular level.

         <title>Broad Dual Emission by Codoping Cr3+ (d&#8594;d) and Bi3+ (s&#8594;p) in Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Codoping Cr3+ and Bi3+ in Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6 double perovskite combines d&#8594;d and s&#8594;p electronic transitions to develop a single material showing broad near infrared (NIR) and white light emission. The broad NIR peak overlaps with water vibrational overtone absorption at &#8776;1000&#8197;nm, enabling non&#8208;invasive food inspection using phosphor converted light emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs).







Abstract
A phosphor emitting both white light and broad near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation can simultaneously provide visual inspection and early signs of rotting of food products. The broad NIR emission is absorbed by the vibrational overtones of water molecules present in food items, providing the non&#8208;invasive image contrast to assess the food freshness. Here we design a phosphor, namely, Cr3+&#8208;Bi3+&#8208;codoped Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6, that simultaneously emit warm white light and broad NIR (1000&#8197;nm) radiation with quantum yield 27&#8201;%. This dual emitter is designed by combining the features of s2&#8208;electron (Bi3+) and d3&#8208;electron (Cr3+) doping in a weak crystal field of the halide perovskite host. 
 excitation of Bi3+, using a commercial 370&#8197;nm ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (UV&#8208;LED), yields both the emissions. A fraction of the excited Bi3+ dopants emit the warm white light, and the other fraction transfers its energy non&#8208;radiatively to Cr3+. Then the Cr3+ de&#8208;excites emitting broad NIR emission. Temperature dependent (6.4&#8211;300&#8197;K) photoluminescence in combination with Tanabe&#8208;Sugano diagram show that the Cr3+ experiences a weak crystal field (
=2.2), yielding the 
 NIR emission. As a proof of concept, we fabricated a panel containing 122 phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs, demonstrating its capability to inspect food products.

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208;Soluble Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen with Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interactions for Targeted NIR Imaging of Cancer Cells and Type&#8197;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the distinctive structural features of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, a highly water&#8208;soluble type I AIE&#8208;active photosensitizer (DPBC&#8208;Br) with NIR&#8208;I emission was successfully developed through a counterion exchange strategy. DPBC&#8208;Br exhibits a prolonged retention time in tumors and generates type I reactive oxygen species under light irradiation to effectively suppress tumor growth.







Abstract
The low oxygen dependence of type I photosensitizers (PSs) has made them a popular choice for treating solid tumors. However, the drawbacks of poor water solubility, short emission wavelength, poor stability, and inability to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells limit the application of most type I PSs in clinical therapy. Thereby, developing novel type I PSs for overcoming these problems is an urgent but challenging task. Herein, by utilizing the distinctive structural characteristics of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, a highly water&#8208;soluble type&#8197;I PS (DPBC&#8208;Br) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristic and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission is fabricated for the first time. DPBC&#8208;Br displays remarkable water solubility (7.3&#8197;mM) and outstanding photobleaching resistance, enabling efficient and precise differentiation between tumor cells and normal cells in a wash&#8208;free and long&#8208;term tracking manner via NIR&#8208;I imaging. Additionally, the superior type&#8197;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by DPBC&#8208;Br provide both specific killing of cancer cells in vitro and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, with negligible systemic toxicity. This study rationally constructs a highly water&#8208;soluble type&#8197;I PS, which has higher reliability and controllability compared with conventional nanoparticle formulating procedures, offering great potential for clinical cancer treatment.

A Ni0&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes was studied. Either of the two product isomers, 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentenes, was selectively obtained depending on the choice of ligands. Experimental and computational investigations of the reaction revealed a clear insight into the origin of such high product selectivity.







Abstract
A ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence in Ni&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclopropanes to 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentenes is reported. The 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene is selectively obtained depending on the choice of ligands. Detailed kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations on the catalytic cycle revealed that the product selectivity is determined at the reductive elimination step from the six&#8208;membered &#951;1&#8208;allyl intermediate.

         <title>Cu Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;Atom catalysts are used as selective catalysts for acetylene hydrogenation. The adsorption of acetylene and ethylene intermediates on the active site can be weakened by separating the continuous active sites into single sites, thereby increasing the energy barrier of overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling, and inhibiting side reactions.







Abstract
The site isolation strategy has been employed in thermal catalytic acetylene semihydrogenation to inhibit overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling. However, there is a dearth of analogous investigations in electrocatalytic systems. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) simulations demonstrate that isolated Cu metal sites have higher energy barriers on overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling. Following this result, we develop Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts highly dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix, which exhibit high ethylene selectivity (&gt;80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for ethylene, &lt;1&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for C4, and no ethane) at high concentrations of acetylene. The superior performance observed in the electrocatalytic selective hydrogenation of acetylene can be attributed to the weak adsorption of ethylene intermediates and highly energy barriers on C&#8722;C coupling at isolated sites, as confirmed by both DFT calculations and experimental results. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the isolated sites inhibiting the side reactions of electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.

         <title>Transient Transcription Machineries Modulate Dynamic Functions of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Temporal Regulation of Biocatalytic Circuits, Gene Replication and Transcription</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient transcription machinery functions are dynamically modulated by G&#8208;quadruplex (GQ) topologies. This is exemplified by the transient separation of the quadruplex aptamer/thrombin complex and activation of catalytic thrombin functions, the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;controlled transient synthesis of genes, and the temporal G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;promoted or inhibited transcription circuits.







Abstract
Native G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;regulated temporal biocatalytic circuits, gene polymerization, and transcription processes are emulated by biomimetic, synthetically engineered transcription machineries coupled to reconfigurable G&#8208;quadruplex nanostructures. These are addressed by the following example: (i) A reaction module demonstrates the fuel&#8208;triggered transcription machinery&#8208;guided transient synthesis of G&#8208;quadruplex nanostructures. (ii) A dynamically triggered and modulated transcription machinery that guides the temporal separation and reassembly of the anti&#8208;thrombin G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer/thrombin complex is introduced, and the transient thrombin&#8208;catalyzed coagulation of fibrinogen is demonstrated. (iii) A dynamically fueled transient transcription machinery for the temporal activation of G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;topologically blocked gene polymerization circuits is introduced. (iv) Transcription circuits revealing G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;promoted or G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;inhibited cascaded transcription machineries are presented. Beyond advancing the rapidly developing field of dynamically modulated G&#8208;quadruplex DNA nanostructures, the systems introduce potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Reactions from Individual Impacts to Global Transformation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single ball drop on a thin layer of loose bis(dibenzoylmethanato)NiII powders induces a partial trimerization reaction as a result of the severe mechanical deformation accompanying the formation of the powder compact. Repeated ball drops on the same powder compact result in an approximately linear increase of the trimer amount.







Abstract
Typically induced by the mechanical processing of powders in ball mills, mechanochemical transformations are considered to result from the application of mechanical force to solid reactants. However, the undeniable deep connection between the dynamic compaction of powders during impacts and the overall transformation degree has yet to be disclosed. In the present work, we show that the square planar bis(dibenzoylmethanato)NiII coordination compound undergoes trimerization when its powder experiences even a single ball impact. Based on systematic experiments with individual ball impacts and analysis by Raman spectroscopy, we provide here quantitative mapping of the transformation in the powder compact and deduce bulk reaction kinetics from multiple individual impacts.

         <title>Fast Modulation of d&#8208;Band Holes Quantity in the Early Reaction Stages for Boosting Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of highly loaded iridium single atom catalysts with tunable d&#8208;band holes during the reaction process was designed as an efficient OER catalyst in acidic solutions. The in situ modulated d&#8208;band holes and near&#8208;steady XO*&#8722;Ir&#8722;N4 moieties at early working voltages are responsible for the observed high activity and stability.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts applied in acidic water electrolysis remains a grand challenge. Here, we construct a type of high&#8208;loading iridium single atom catalysts with tunable d&#8208;band holes character (h&#8208;HL&#8722;Ir SACs, &#8764;17.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Ir) realized in the early OER operation stages. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the quantity of the d&#8208;band holes of Ir active sites can be fast increased by 0.56 unit from the open circuit to a low working potential of 1.35&#8197;V. More remarkably, in situ synchrotron infrared and Raman spectroscopies demonstrate the quick accumulation of *OOH and *OH intermediates over holes&#8208;modulated Ir sites in the early reaction voltages, achieving a rapid OER kinetics. As a result, this well&#8208;designed h&#8208;HL&#8722;Ir SACs exhibits superior performance for acidic OER with overpotentials of 216&#8197;mV @10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 259&#8197;mV @100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, corresponding to a small Tafel slope of 43&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The activity of catalyst shows no evident attenuation after 60&#8197;h operation in acidic environment. This work provides some useful hints for the design of superior acidic OER catalysts.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Activation Coupling with a Schottky Junction Boosts the Electrochemiluminescence of Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Au atoms and Au nanoparticles anchored on carbon nitride serve as dual active sites for efficiently accelerating charge transfer and activating the co&#8208;reactant peroxydisulfate, while the Schottky junctions between Au nanoparticles and carbon nitride can trap over&#8208;injected electrons to prevent electrode passivation, resulting in a boosted electrochemiluminescence intensity and stable emission.







Abstract
Robust electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of carbon nitride (CN) requires efficient electron&#8208;hole recombination and the suppression of electrode passivation. In this work, Au nanoparticles and single atoms (AuSA+NP) loaded on CN serve as dual active sites that significantly accelerate charge transfer and activate peroxydisulfate. Meanwhile, the well&#8208;established Schottky junctions between Au NPs and CN act as electron sinks, effectively trapping over&#8208;injected electrons to prevent electrode passivation. As a result, the porous CN modified with AuSA+NP exhibits an enhanced and stable ECL emission, with a minimal relative standard deviation of 0.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, the designed ECL biosensor based on AuSA+NP&#8208;CN shows a remarkable performance in detecting organophosphorus pesticides. This innovative strategy has the potential to offer new insights into strong and stable ECL emission for practical applications.

Meanwhile, the well-established Schottky junctions between Au NPs and CN act as electron sinks, effectively trapping over-injected electrons to prevent electrode passivation. As a result, the porous CN modified with Au&lt;sub&gt;SA+NP&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits an enhanced and stable ECL emission, with a minimal relative standard deviation of 0.24&#8201;%. Furthermore, the designed ECL biosensor based on Au&lt;sub&gt;SA+NP&lt;/sub&gt;-CN shows a remarkable performance in detecting organophosphorus pesticides. This innovative strategy has the potential to offer new insights into strong and stable ECL emission for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photosynthesis&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Biomineralization of Gold Nanoparticles inside Chlorella Cells towards Hydrogen Boosting under Green Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthesis&#8208;mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside Chlorella cells preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain was achieved. The electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of the biomineralized AuNPs could augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which gives rise to an 8.3&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen production under 560&#8197;nm light irradiation.







Abstract
Engineering living microorganisms to enhance green biomanufacturing for the development of sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral energy strategies has attracted the interest of researchers from a wide range of scientific communities. In this study, we develop a method to achieve photosynthesis&#8208;mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside Chlorella cells, where the photosynthesis&#8208;dominated reduction of Au3+ to Au0 allows the formed AuNPs to locate preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain. In particular, we reveal that the electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs could greatly augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which then promotes the generation and transferring of photoelectrons throughout the photosynthetic chain for augmented hydrogen production under sunlight. We demonstrate that the electrons from AuNPs could be directly transferred to hydrogenase, giving rise to an 8.3&#8208;fold enhancement of Chlorella cells hydrogen production independent of the cellular photosynthetic process under monochromatic 560&#8197;nm light irradiation. Overall, the photosynthesis&#8208;mediated intracellular biomineralization of AuNPs could contribute to a novel paradigm for functionalizing Chlorella cells to augment biomanufacturing.

Silver&#8211;acetylene interactions adopting a heteroleptic ternary coordination mode enabled the synthesis of concave polyhedral cages upon anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;triggered interconversion of highly entangled polyhedra. In their Communication (e202303714), Yuya Domoto and co&#8208;workers describe skeletally edited 3D architectures having partially disconnected knot or link motifs at their polyhedral faces.

Heterometal doping of metal nanoclusters is a powerful method for tuning their physicochemical properties. Thus far, the metal dopants incorporated into the nanoclusters are limited to group 10&#8211;12 metals with closed d&#8208;shells. In their Research Article (e202302591), Eunji Sim, Dongil Lee, and co&#8208;workers show that open d&#8208;shell group 8 and 9 metals can be incorporated into a silver nanocluster by forming metal&#8208;hydride superatoms.

Microbial electrosynthesis is a sustainable strategy for electricity&#8208;driven chemical production. In their Communication (e202305189), Guillermo&#8197;C. Bazan et&#8197;al. designed an n&#8208;type redox&#8208;active conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) that intercalates into cell membranes and mimics the function of endogenous transmembrane electron transport proteins. The incorporation of the COE into electroactive bacteria amplifies current uptake from the electrode, leading to enhanced microbial electrosynthesis.

Uranyl tetrahalide ions assemble into a hybrid material through non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) in the presence of organic charge balancing cations. NCIs such as hydrogen bonds serve to stabilize these supramolecular hybrid complexes and act as the fundamental driving force for crystallization. In their Research Article (e202305073), Sara&#8197;E. Mason, Tori&#8197;Z. Forbes et&#8197;al. employed these hybrid complexes as a model system to assess the effect of NCIs on the vibrational properties and formation enthalpies of metal&#8211;organic hybrid materials.

         <title>Understanding MOF Flexibility: An Analysis Focused on Pillared Layer MOFs as a Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks respond to molecular or physical stimuli with spontaneous pore opening or closing, leading to applications in gas separation, storage, sensing, actuation etc. The review provides insights into decisive factors affecting switchability gained from combined simulations, in situ characterization methods and the dedicated design of pillared&#8208;layer MOF model materials varying in composition, structure, size, morphology, and disorder.







Abstract
Flexible porous frameworks are at the forefront of materials research. A unique feature is their ability to open and close their pores in an adaptive manner induced by chemical and physical stimuli. Such enzyme&#8208;like selective recognition offers a wide range of functions ranging from gas storage and separation to sensing, actuation, mechanical energy storage and catalysis. However, the factors affecting switchability are poorly understood. In particular, the role of building blocks, as well as secondary factors (crystal size, defects, cooperativity) and the role of host&#8211;guest interactions, profit from systematic investigations of an idealized model by advanced analytical techniques and simulations. The review describes an integrated approach targeting the deliberate design of pillared layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks as idealized model materials for the analysis of critical factors affecting framework dynamics and summarizes the resulting progress in their understanding and application.

         <title>Adaptive Catalytic Systems for Chemical Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the use of biomass, CO2, and green hydrogen has reached a significant level of maturity, the need to re&#8208;consider our ways of operating chemical production processes becomes obvious. The fluctuation associated with renewable energy and feedstock holds challenges for catalysts to cope with the resulting dynamics. However, new opportunities arise once catalyst design starts to aim at performance that is adaptive rather than task&#8208;specific.







Abstract
The rapidly growing importance of green hydrogen and renewable carbon resources as essential feedstocks for sustainable chemical value chains opens room for disruptive innovations regarding chemical production processes. The fluctuation and variability associated with non&#8208;fossil energy and raw material supply holds many challenges for catalysts to cope with the resulting dynamics. However, many new opportunities also arise once catalyst design starts to aim at performance that is &#8220;adaptive&#8221; rather than &#8220;task&#8208;specific&#8221;. In this Scientific Perspective, we propose to define adaptivity in catalysis on the basis of three essential properties that are reversibility, rapidity, and robustness (R3 rule). Promising design strategies and selected examples are described to substantiate the scientific concept and to highlight its potential for chemical energy conversion.

The scope of biological and synthetic nanopores can be structurally and functionally expanded by chemical modification with DNA and also entirely DNA&#8208;based nanopores can be created for applications in sensing, biological research, and synthetic biology.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;spanning nanopores are used in label&#8208;free single&#8208;molecule sensing and next&#8208;generation portable nucleic acid sequencing, and as powerful research tools in biology, biophysics, and synthetic biology. Naturally occurring protein and peptide pores, as well as synthetic inorganic nanopores, are used in these applications, with their limitations. The structural and functional repertoire of nanopores can be considerably expanded by functionalising existing pores with DNA strands and by creating an entirely new class of nanopores with DNA nanotechnology. This review outlines progress in this area of functional DNA nanopores and outlines developments to open up new applications.

         <title>Bioorthogonally Assisted Phototherapy: Recent Advances and Prospects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototherapeutic approaches combined with bioorthogonal chemistry are expected to significantly improve the spatiotemporal precision of targeted therapies. As a result, related bioorthogonally assisted phototherapy research has recently intensified. This minireview briefly discusses the latest developments in the state of the art.







Abstract
Photoresponsive materials offer excellent spatiotemporal control over biological processes and the emerging phototherapeutic methods are expected to have significant effects on targeted cancer therapies. Recent examples show that combination of photoactivatable approaches with bioorthogonal chemistry enhances the precision of targeted phototherapies and profound implications are foreseen particularly in the treatment of disperse/diffuse tumors. The extra level of on&#8208;target selectivity and improved spatial/temporal control considerably intensified related bioorthogonally assisted phototherapy research. The anticipated growth of further developments in the field justifies the timeliness of a brief summary of the state of the art.

         <title>Antioxidant and Prooxidant Nanozymes: From Cellular Redox Regulation to Next&#8208;Generation Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review offers an overview of the recent development of redox&#8208;active nanozymes, primarily highlighting antioxidant and prooxidant nanozymes and their therapeutic significance in oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;mediated disorders with an outlook on the current challenges and future trends. The insight provided should aid the development of next&#8208;generation therapeutic nanozymes for translation into clinical settings.







Abstract
Nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity, have attracted tremendous interest in recent years owing to their ability to replace natural enzymes in various biomedical applications, such as biosensing, therapeutics, drug delivery, and bioimaging. In particular, the nanozymes capable of regulating the cellular redox status by mimicking the antioxidant enzymes in mammalian cells are of great therapeutic significance in oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;mediated disorders. As the distinction of physiological oxidative stress (oxidative eustress) and pathological oxidative stress (oxidative distress) occurs at a fine borderline, it is a great challenge to design nanozymes that can differentially sense the two extremes in cells, tissues and organs and mediate appropriate redox chemical reactions. In this Review, we summarize the advances in the development of redox&#8208;active nanozymes and their biomedical applications. We primarily highlight the therapeutic significance of the antioxidant and prooxidant nanozymes in various disease model systems, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. The future perspectives of this emerging area of research and the challenges associated with the biomedical applications of nanozymes are described.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer Degradation of Vinyl Polymers: Cleavage of a Backbone C&#8722;C Bond Triggered by Radical Activation of a C&#8722;H Bond in a Pendant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradation of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonded (meth)acrylate&#8208;based copolymers has been achieved without relying on introduction of a labile bond in the backbone. Carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8722;H) bonds that are specifically active for photocatalyzed HAT reaction were introduced through radical copolymerization with vinyl ether. Radical generation from the C&#8722;H bond in the pendant triggered the cleavage of the strong C&#8722;C bond in the backbone.







Abstract
In this work, we achieved a triggering degradation of polymers composed of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonded backbone without relying on introduction of labile heteroatom&#8208;based bond. The crucial point for the achievement is using vinyl ether (VE) as a comonomer in radical copolymerization of (meth)acrylate for introduction of the carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8722;H) bonds active for photocatalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as triggers in the pendant. Interestingly, methyl methacrylate (MMA)&#8208;n&#8208;butyl vinyl ether (NBVE) copolymer underwent degradation in acetonitrile in the presence of benzophenone (Ph2CO) under UV irradiation at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The degradation did not take place, when any one of UV, Ph2CO, heat, and NBVE unit was removed or HAT&#8208;active solvent such as toluene and 1,4&#8208;dioxane was used. These control experiments strongly supported the HAT&#8208;triggering degradation. Furthermore, the degradation behaviors of the copolymers with other vinyl ethers such as tert&#8208;butyl vinyl ether and methyl isopropenyl ether indicated that the C&#8722;H bond neighboring to oxygen on the pendant is mainly responsible for the trigger leading to degradation. The HAT&#8208;triggering degradation was also demonstrated even with the acrylate&#8208;based copolymer.

         <title>Highly Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions Catalyzed by Diboronate Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of easily synthesized, air and moisture stable compounds called bispyrrolidine diboronates (BPDB) is reported. Under Lewis acid activation, they can catalyze highly exo&#8208;selective and enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. For diactivated dienophiles, BPDB can also selectively activate one of the two carbonyl groups based on steric effect, resulting in highly regioselective asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective catalytic system for exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions was developed based on the newly discovered bispyrrolidine diboronates (BPDB). Activated by various Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids, BPDB can catalyze highly stereoselective asymmetric exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of monocarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles. When 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles are used, the catalyst can sterically distinguish between the two binding sites, which leads to highly regioselective asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. BPDB can be prepared as crystalline solids on a large scale and are stable under ambient condition. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the structure for acid&#8208;activated BPDB indicated that its activation involves cleavage of a labile B&#8592;N bond.

         <title>Interconversion of Highly Entangled Polyhedra into Concave Polyhedra by Nitrate&#8208;Induced Ternary Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;triggered interconversion of entangled (Ag3L2)n polyhedra has resulted in a formal metal insertion into their main frameworks to give a new series of concave polyhedra, supported by a heteroleptic ternary coordination mode with cooperating metal&#8211;acetylene interactions. This finding provides clues toward the skeletal editing of large, complex 3D architectures.







Abstract
Entangled (M3L2)n polyhedral complexes represent a unique class of supramolecular architectures that are stabilized by relatively weak metal&#8211;acetylene interactions in cooperation with conventional metal&#8211;pyridyl coordination. Counter&#8208;anion exchange of these complexes with a nitrate (NO3&#8722;) ion triggered formal metal insertion between the metal centers, and a heteroleptic ternary coordination mode with acetylenic, pyridyl, and nitrate donors was generated on the metal centers. As a result, the main frameworks of the polyhedral complexes M18L12 and M12L8 were formally extended into a new series of concave polyhedra having the compositions M21L12 and M13L8, respectively. This transformation also resulted in the local disconnection of the highly entangled trifurcate topology of the framework, providing clues toward the skeletal editing of extended and complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks by 8&#8208;Connected Quadrangular Prism Ligands for Water Harvesting</title>

         <dc:description>
Two bcu Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2, have been built from 8&#8208;connected (8&#8208;c) cubic Zr6O4(OH)4(H2O)8 clusters and 8&#8208;c peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands. Impressively, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits promising application in water harvesting from air with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83&#8197;gH2O&#8201;gMOF&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.90 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles.







Abstract
Utilization of rigid, highly connected organic linkers is critical for the reticular synthesis of functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, highly&#8208;stable MOFs (e.g. Al/Cr/Zr&#8208;based MOFs) based on rigid ligands with more than 6 coordinating functions have been rarely achieved thus far. Herein, we describe the construction of two bcu Zr&#8208;based MOFs (named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2) from peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands (H8PEP&#8208;1 and H8PEP&#8208;2) with rigid quadrangular prism shape possessing 8 carboxylic groups at the prism vertices. Particularly, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits microporous structure with large Bruno&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface area and high water stability, endowing it a promising water harvesting material with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83&#8197;gH2O&#8201;gMOF&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.90 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Moreover, self&#8208;consistent charge density functional tight&#8208;binding calculations were carried out, rationalizing the water adsorbing process and amount in ZrMOF&#8208;1.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Mimics Transmembrane Electron Transport Proteins for Enhanced Microbial Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of an n&#8208;type (i.e., redox cycles between reduced and neutral states) redox&#8208;active conjugated oligoelectrolyte, COE&#8208;NDI, has been designed and synthesized. Spontaneous membrane intercalation of COE&#8208;NDI in Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 amplifies inward extracellular electron transfer for more efficient bio&#8208;electroreduction of fumarate to succinate, owing to COE&#8208;NDI&#8217;s function as a transmembrane redox mediator.







Abstract
Interfacing bacteria as biocatalysts with an electrode provides the basis for emerging bioelectrochemical systems that enable sustainable energy interconversion between electrical and chemical energy. Electron transfer rates at the abiotic&#8208;biotic interface are, however, often limited by poor electrical contacts and the intrinsically insulating cell membranes. Herein, we report the first example of an n&#8208;type redox&#8208;active conjugated oligoelectrolyte, namely COE&#8208;NDI, which spontaneously intercalates into cell membranes and mimics the function of endogenous transmembrane electron transport proteins. The incorporation of COE&#8208;NDI into Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 cells amplifies current uptake from the electrode by 4&#8208;fold, resulting in the enhanced bio&#8208;electroreduction of fumarate to succinate. Moreover, COE&#8208;NDI can serve as a &#8220;protein prosthetic&#8221; to rescue current uptake in non&#8208;electrogenic knockout mutants.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbene Derived Propellers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet carbenes have emerged as attractive building blocks for functional materials. Herein we show that cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs)&#8212;a class of highly ambiphilic singlet carbenes&#8212;provide access to organic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular emitters. These propeller&#8208;like luminophores exhibit through&#8208;space arene&#8208;arene &#960;&#8208;delocalization and rapid intramolecular inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC).







Abstract
Organic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular emitters featuring dynamic propeller&#8208;like luminophores were prepared in one step from cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs). These molecules exhibit through&#8208;space arene&#8208;arene &#960;&#8208;delocalization and rapid intramolecular inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC) in line with their helical character.

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Amphiphilic Oligourethanes with a Cascade Self&#8208;Immolative Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete self&#8208;immolative oligourethanes bearing N&#8208;naphthylcarbamate or N&#8208;(3&#8208;fluorophenyl)carbamate backbones are modularly synthesized. These oligourethanes undergo both photo&#8208;triggered cascade degradation and selective cleavage of benzyl&#8208;O linkages under tandem MS conditions. They self&#8208;assemble into unique nanostructures such as flat nanosheets, nanofibers, and nanoribbons, and a morphological transition is achieved upon thermal annealing.







Abstract
Discrete polymers offer an excellent platform for comprehending the interplay between precise chain structures, distinctive self&#8208;assembly behavior, and functional applications, whereas the development of discrete polymers with self&#8208;immolative properties remains scarce. Here, we modularly synthesize a library of discrete self&#8208;immolative oligourethanes containing N&#8208;naphthylcarbamate or N&#8208;(3&#8208;fluorophenyl)carbamate repeating units via iterative stepwise growth. These oligourethanes undergo not only cascade 1,6&#8208;elimination depolymerizations via photo&#8208;mediated removal of o&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate triggers but also selective cleavage of benzyl&#8208;O linkages under MS/MS conditions even without UV light irradiation. In aqueous media, these discrete oligourethanes self&#8208;assemble into different morphologies such as flat nanosheets, nanofibers, and nanoribbons, depending on the chain lengths and backbone compositions, and further morphological transitions are observed upon thermal annealing.

A lanthanide chalcogenide scintillator, based on the quaternary chalcogenide LaCsSiS4&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;%&#8201;Ce3+, integrates the multiple merits of high light yield, fast decay time, low detection limit, and decent radiation/moisture resistance, suggesting the potential of lanthanide chalcogenide as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance scintillators.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors requires scintillators with fast decay time, high light yield, stability, and X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, which are difficult to achieve in a single material. Here, we present the first example of a lanthanide chalcogenide of LaCsSiS4&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;%&#8201;Ce3+ that simultaneously integrates multiple desirable properties for an ideal scintillator. LaCsSiS4&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;%&#8201;Ce3+ demonstrates a remarkably low detection limit of 43.13&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.24&#8201;%, resulting in a high light yield of 50480&#177;1441&#8197;photons/MeV. Notably, LaCsSiS4&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;%&#8201;Ce3+ exhibits a fast decay time of only 29.35&#177;0.16&#8197;ns, making it one of the fastest scintillators among all lanthanide&#8208;based inorganic scintillators. Furthermore, this material shows robust radiation and moisture resistance, endowing it with suitability for chemical processing under solution conditions. To demonstrate the X&#8208;ray imaging capacity of LaCsSiS4&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;%&#8201;Ce3+, we fabricated a flexible X&#8208;ray detector that achieved a high spatial resolution of 8.2&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of lanthanide chalcogenide as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>Do Corroles Stabilize Tetravalent Antimony?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ligand radical instead of an antimony(IV) species forms upon the oxidation of antimony(III)corroles in the absence of hard donor ligands. EPR investigations reveal a strong coupling of the unpaired electron to the 121Sb and 123Sb nuclei due to a small 5&#8197;s orbital contribution of the SOMO. The compound undergoes a redox disproportionation in the presence of water which can be applied to prepare the elusive hydroxo antimony(V)corrole.







Abstract
Antimony corrole cations have been prepared by one&#8208;electron oxidation of antimony(III) congeners with silver(I) and copper(II) salts. Isolation and crystallization was successful for the first time, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic investigation unraveled structural similarities with antimony(III)corroles. EPR experiments showed strong hyperfine interactions of the unpaired electron with the 121Sb (I=5/2) and 123Sb nuclei (I=7/2). A DFT analysis supports the description of the oxidized form as a SbIII corrole radical with less than 2&#8201;% SbIV character. In the presence of water or a fluoride source like PF6&#8722;, the compounds undergo a redox disproportionation to yield known antimony(III)corroles and either difluorido&#8208;antimony(V)corroles, or bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxido&#8208;di[antimony(V)corroles] via novel cationic hydroxo&#8208;antimony(V) derivatives.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Based Crosslinked Porous Microcapsules for Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous microcapsules of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were constructed for enzymatic catalysis, featuring bio&#8208;friendly aqueous microenvironments and size&#8208;selective porous shells that allow for the diffusion of substrates and products while excluding protease. The COF microcapsules containing Candida Antarctica lipase B (CALB) exhibited enhanced catalytic activity, recyclability, and durability for both batch and continuous&#8208;flow reactions.







Abstract
The design of porous microcapsules with selective mass transfer and mechanical robustness for enzyme encapsulation is highly desired for biocatalysis, yet the construction remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile fabrication of porous microcapsules by assembling covalent organic framework (COF) spheres at the interfaces of emulsion droplets followed by interparticle crosslinking. The COF microcapsules could offer an enclosed aqueous environment for enzymes, with size&#8208;selective porous shells that allow for the fast diffusion of substrates and products while excluding larger molecules such as protease. Crosslinking of COF spheres not only enhances the structural stability of capsules but also imparts enrichment effects. The enzymes encased in the COF microcapsules show enhanced activity and durability in organic media as verified in both batch reaction and continuous&#8208;flow reaction. The COF microcapsules offer a promising platform for the encapsulation of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Glucose Oxidation by the Pt Oxidation State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of Pt oxidation state on the activity and selectivity was elucidated for the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. A new analytical approach was used to quantify all (intermediate) products. Pt0 was found to promote the dehydrogenation of primary alcohol groups (i.e., promote glucose dialdehyde formation), while PtOx was found to promote oxygen transfer reactions (i.e., promote gluconic acid formation).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic glucose oxidation can produce high value chemicals, but selectivity needs to be improved. Here we elucidate the role of the Pt oxidation state on the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose with a new analytical approach, using high&#8208;pressure liquid chromatography and high&#8208;pressure anion exchange chromatography. It was found that the type of oxidation, i.e. dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohol groups or oxygen transfer to aldehyde groups, strongly depends on the Pt oxidation state. Pt0 has a 7&#8208;fold higher activity for dehydrogenation reactions than for oxidation reactions, while PtOx is equally active for both reactions. Thus, Pt0 promotes glucose dialdehyde formation, while PtOx favors gluconate formation. The successive dehydrogenation of gluconate is achieved selectively at the primary alcohol group by Pt0, while PtOx also promotes the dehydrogenation of secondary alcohol groups, resulting in more complex reaction mixtures.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Driven Assembly of a Penta&#8208;Shell Keplerate Cuprofullerene for Metallofullerene Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Icosahedral penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, has been successfully assembled, templated by a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8722;CuI and CuI&#8722;Cl coordination bonds canopied with 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer. The shells are interconnected to form 2D or 3D (snf net) frameworks by sharing the outmost Cl atoms.







Abstract
Two metallofullerene frameworks (MFFs) constructed from a penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully prepared via a C60&#8208;templated symmetry&#8208;driven strategy. The icosahedral cuprofullerene chloride is assembled on a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8722;CuI and CuI&#8722;Cl coordination bonds, resulting in the penta&#8208;shell Keplerate with the C60 core canopied by 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms that fulfill the tic@rco@oae@ico@ico penta&#8208;shell polyhedral configuration. By sharing the outmost&#8208;shell Cl atoms, the cuprofullerene chlorides are connected into 2D or 3D (snf net) frameworks. TD&#8208;DFT calculations reveal that the charge transfer from the outmost CuI and Cl to C60 core is responsible for their light absorption expansion to near&#8208;infrared region, implying anionic halogenation may be an effective strategy to tune the light absorption properties of metallofullerene materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two metallofullerene frameworks (MFFs) constructed from a penta-shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;@Cl&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;@Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, have been successfully prepared via a C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-templated symmetry-driven strategy. The icosahedral cuprofullerene chloride is assembled on a C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecule through [&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-(C=C)]&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Cl coordination bonds, resulting in the penta-shell Keplerate with the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; core canopied by 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms that fulfill the &lt;b&gt;tic&lt;/b&gt;@&lt;b&gt;rco&lt;/b&gt;@&lt;b&gt;oae&lt;/b&gt;@&lt;b&gt;ico&lt;/b&gt;@&lt;b&gt;ico&lt;/b&gt; penta-shell polyhedral configuration. By sharing the outmost-shell Cl atoms, the cuprofullerene chlorides are connected into 2D or 3D (&lt;b&gt;snf&lt;/b&gt; net) frameworks. TD-DFT calculations reveal that the charge transfer from the outmost Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl to C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; core is responsible for their light absorption expansion to near-infrared region, implying anionic halogenation may be an effective strategy to tune the light absorption properties of metallofullerene materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Cells Operating at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first low&#8208;temperature potassium&#8208;ion full cells have been successfully fabricated by using hard carbon (HC) anodes with matched electrolyte, as well as compatible cathodes. The potassium storage in HC relies on defect adsorption, interlayer co&#8208;intercalation, and nanopore filling, endowing full cells with excellent electrochemical performances at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work represents a significant advancement in the field of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are promising for cryogenic energy storage. However, current researches on low&#8208;temperature PIBs are limited to half cells utilizing potassium metal as an anode, and realizing rechargeable full cells is challenged by lacking viable anode materials and compatible electrolytes. Herein, a hard carbon (HC)&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature potassium&#8208;ion full cell is successfully fabricated for the first time. Experimental evidence and theoretical analysis revealed that potassium storage behaviors of HC anodes in the matched low&#8208;temperature electrolyte involve defect adsorption, interlayer co&#8208;intercalation, and nanopore filling. Notably, these unique potassiation processes exhibited low interfacial resistances and small reaction activation energies, enabling an excellent cycling performance of HC with a capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C (68&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity). Consequently, the HC&#8208;based full cells demonstrated impressive rechargeability and high energy density above 100&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, representing a significant advancement in the development of PIBs.

         <title>14.31&#8201;% Power Conversion Efficiency of Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells via Efficient Reduction of Sn4+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully identified the distribution of Sn4+ on both the top and bottom surfaces of the perovskite layer. A thin layer of Sn metal was introduced at the surfaces. The implementation of this strategic insertion resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of Sn4+ and trap densities. The device was able to attain a power conversion efficiency of 14.31&#8201;% through the optimization of carrier transportation.







Abstract
The photoelectric properties of nontoxic Sn&#8208;based perovskite make it a promising alternative to toxic Pb&#8208;based perovskite. It has superior photovoltaic performance in comparison to other Pb&#8208;free counterparts. The facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ presents a notable obstacle in the advancement of perovskite solar cells that utilize Sn, as it adversely affects their stability and performance. The study revealed the presence of a Sn4+ concentration on both the upper and lower surfaces of the perovskite layer. This discovery led to the adoption of a bi&#8208;interface optimization approach. A thin layer of Sn metal was inserted at the two surfaces of the perovskite layer. The implementation of this intervention yielded a significant decrease in the levels of Sn4+ and trap densities. The power conversion efficiency of the device was achieved at 14.31&#8201;% through the optimization of carrier transportation. The device exhibited operational and long&#8208;term stability.

         <dc:description>
NH3 and CH4 gases were applied as precursors to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC) photocatalysts. Without any co&#8208;catalysts, the NDC was demonstrated to drive photoredox reactions, and active sites on the NDC have been investigated. Because in the Archean era, the atmosphere of Earth was filled with NH3 and CH4 gases, this study is important to understand the evolution of biomolecules in the Earth by photochemistry.







Abstract
Earth's primordial atmosphere was rich in ammonia and methane. To understand the evolution of the atmosphere, these two gases were used to make photoredox&#8208;active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). Photocatalysts such as NDC might play an important role in the development of geological and atmospheric chemistry during the Archean era. This study describes the synthesis of NDC directly from NH3 and CH4 gases. The photocatalyst product can be used to selectively synthesize imines by photo&#8208;oxidization of amines, producing H2O2 simultaneously in the photoreduction reaction. Our findings shed light on the chemical evolution of the Earth.

         <title>ATP Drives the Formation of a Catalytic Hydrazone through an Energy Ratchet Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) accelerates hydrazone&#8208;bond formation between an aldehyde and hydrazide and shifts the equilibrium reaction towards the product. Removal of the ATP using an enzyme largely reverses this beneficial effect and results in the formation of a kinetically stable state enriched in hydrazone. In this state, the reaction mixture has a higher catalytic activity compared to the same mixture at thermodynamic equilibrium.







Abstract
An energy ratchet mechanism is exploited for the synthesis of a molecule. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hydrazone&#8208;bond formation between an aldehyde and hydrazide is accelerated and the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted towards the hydrazone. Enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP installs a kinetically stable state, at which hydrazone is present at a higher concentration compared to the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium in the presence of the degradation products of ATP. It is shown that the kinetic state has an enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of an RNA&#8208;model compound.

         <title>Emodin&#8208;Based Nanoarchitectonics with Giant Two&#8208;Photon Absorption for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emodin&#8208;based nanoparticles (E/H NPs) are fabricated by the co&#8208;assembly of Emo and HSA. E/H NPs possess a super&#8208;large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (TPAC) and ideal singlet oxygen (1O2) generation capability. They can be easily internalized by tumors and exhibit outstanding anti&#8208;cancer efficacy at ultra&#8208;low dosages.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited photodynamic therapy (TPE&#8208;PDT) has significant advantages over conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, obtaining easily accessible TPE photosensitizers (PSs) with high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that emodin (Emo), a natural anthraquinone (NA) derivative, is a promising TPE PS with a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (TPAC: 380.9&#8197;GM) and high singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (31.9&#8201;%). When co&#8208;assembled with human serum albumin (HSA), the formed Emo/HSA nanoparticles (E/H NPs) possess a giant TPAC (4.02&#215;107&#8197;GM) and desirable 1O2 generation capability, thus showing outstanding TPE&#8208;PDT properties against cancer cells. In vivo experiments reveal that E/H NPs exhibit improved retention time in tumors and can ablate tumors at an ultra&#8208;low dosage (0.2&#8197;mg/kg) under an 800&#8197;nm femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation. This work is beneficial for the use of natural extracts NAs for high&#8208;efficiency TPE&#8208;PDT.

         <title>Electron Donor Coordinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 33, August 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For electron donor coordinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks, the photoelectrochemical electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculations and experiments, which show a self&#8208;supplying electrons strategy. The matching HOMO levels of the light collector and electron&#8208;donor ligands facilitate electron transfer which efficiently suppresses electron&#8208;hole recombination, greatly enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance.







Abstract
To enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance, additional electron donor/acceptor is generally required to inhibit the electron&#8208;hole recombination. However, the enhancement is limited due to the long&#8208;distance diffusion. Herein a self&#8208;supplying electron strategy is designed for PEC enhancement by coordinating an electron donor 1.4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dabco) in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The intrareticular photoelectron transfer mechanism in mixed&#8208;ligand MOF (m&#8208;MOF) is experimentally revealed and verified by density functional theory calculations. The presence of Dabco efficiently inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination due to the self&#8208;supplying electrons and longer electron lifetime in the framework, and thus leads to 23.2&#8208;fold enhancement of photocurrent. As proof of concept, a simple PEC method is constructed with the designed m&#8208;MOF to demonstrate its application in sensitive bioanalysis. This work provides a new avenue for improving the PEC performance of nanomaterials.

         <title>The Power of Action Plots: Unveiling Reaction Selectivity of Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting the optimum wavelength of reactivity for efficient photochemical reactions has been well&#8208;established based on the development of photochemical action plots. We herein demonstrate the power of such action plots by a remarkable example of the wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemistry of two triazolinedione (TAD) substrates, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic substituted, that exhibit near identical absorption spectra yet possess vastly disparate photoreactivity. We present our findings in carefully recorded action plots, from which reaction selectivity is identified. The profound difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; bisfunctional TAD molecule, enabling the formation of a dual&#8208;gated reaction manifold that demonstrates the exceptional and site&#8208;selective (photo)chemical behavior of both TAD substrates within a single small molecule.</dc:description>

The profound difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; bisfunctional TAD molecule, enabling the formation of a dual-gated reaction manifold that demonstrates the exceptional and site-selective (photo)chemical behavior of both TAD substrates within a single small molecule.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Valence State Sites as Favorable Reductive Centers for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting is a key process for producing sustainable and clean hydrogen. Typically, high valence state sites are favorable for oxidation evolution reaction, while low valence states are suitable for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to efficiency and stability issues. However, we propose a high valence state of Co3+&#160;in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8208;S&#8208;FeOx&#160;hybrid as active center for efficient and stable HER, while structural analogues with relatively low chemical states show much worse performance. The Ni9.5Co0.5&#8208;S&#8208;FeOx&#160;catalyst can drive alkaline HER with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 175mV for 1000mAcm&#8208;2&#160;at the industrial working temperature of 60oC, with an excellent stability over 300h. Moreover, this material can work as a favorable bi&#8208;functional catalyst for both OER and HER, with a low cell voltage being 1.730V to achieve 1000mAcm&#8208;2&#160;for overall water splitting over 300h. Synchrotron radiation based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) clearly identifies the high valence Co3+&#160;sites, while in&#8208;situ XAS during HER and theoretical calculations reveal the favorable electron capture capability at Co3+&#160;and suitable H adsorption/desorption energy around the high valence sites, which can accelerate the HER reaction. The understanding of high valence state to drive the reductive reaction may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Tuning of Metal Porphyrins for Improved Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nucleophilic attack of water or hydroxide on metal&#8208;oxo units forms an O&#8208;O bond in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Coordination tuning to improve this attack is intriguing but has been rarely realized. We herein report on improved OER catalysis by metal porphyrin 1&#8208;M (M = Co, Fe) with a coordinatively unsaturated metal ion. We designed and synthesized 1&#8208;M by sterically blocking one porphyrin side with a tethered tetraazacyclododecane unit. With this protection, the metal&#8208;oxo species generated in OER can maintain an unoccupied trans axial site. Importantly, 1&#8208;M displays a higher OER activity in alkaline solutions than analogues lacking such an axial protection by decreasing up to 150&#8208;mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA/cm2 current density. Theoretical studies suggest that with an unoccupied trans axial site, the metal&#8208;oxo unit becomes more positively charged and thus is more favoured for the hydroxide nucleophilic attack as compared to metal&#8208;oxo units bearing trans axial ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Assembly of Nanocrystals on Nanofibers with Strong Interaction for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional fiber architecture serves as an excellent catalyst support. The orderly arrangement of active materials on such a fiber substrate can enhance catalytic performance by exposing more active sites and facilitating mass diffusion; however, this remains a challenge. We developed an interfacial assembly strategy for the orderly distribution of metal nanocrystals on different fiber substrates to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. Using electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) as a representative reaction, the iron&#8208;based nanofiber (Fe/NFs) assembly structure achieved an excellent nitrate removal capacity of 2317 mg N/g Fe and N2 selectivity up to 97.2 %. This strategy could promote the rational design and synthesis of fiber&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovering Dynamic Plant Enzyme Complexes in Yeast for Kratom Alkaloid Pathway Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovering natural product biosynthetic pathways from medicinal plants is challenging and laborious. Capturing the co&#8208;regulation patterns of pathway enzymes, particularly transcriptomic regulation, has proven an effective method to accelerate pathway identification. Here, we developed a yeast&#8208;based screening method to capture the protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) between plant enzymes, which is another useful pattern to complement the prevalent approach. Combining this method with plant multi&#8208;omics analysis, we discovered four enzyme complexes and their organized pathways from kratom, an alkaloid&#8208;producing plant. The four pathway branches involved six enzymes, including a strictosidine synthase, a strictosidine &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosidase (MsSGD), and four medium&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductases (MsMDRs). PPI screening selected six MsMDRs interacting with MsSGD from 20 candidates predicted by multi&#8208;omics analysis. Four of the six MsMDRs were then characterized as functional, indicating the high selectivity of the PPI screening method. This work highlights the opportunity of leveraging post&#8208;translational regulation features to discover novel plant natural product biosynthetic pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Achiral and Chiral Organic Ligands in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Metal Halides to Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield and large dissymmetry factor (glum) in chiral 0D hybrid metal halides by integrating achiral and chiral ligands. A pair of (R/S&#8208;MBA)2(Gua)4(In0.99Sb0.01Cl6)2 H2O (MBA=&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylammonium, Gua=guanidine) HMHs with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and large glum values (~0.01) are constructed.







Abstract
Chiral zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) could combine excellent optical properties and chirality, making them promising for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral 0D HMHs with efficient CPL have been rarely reported. Here, we propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and large dissymmetry factor (glum), by integrating achiral and chiral ligands into 0D HMHs. Specifically, three pairs of chiral 0D hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides are synthesized by combing achiral guanidine with three types of chiral methylbenzylammonium&#8208;based derivatives as the organic cations. These chiral 0D HMHs exhibit near&#8208;unity PLQY and large glum values up to around &#177;1&#215;10&#8722;2. The achiral guanidine ligand is not only essential to crystallize these hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides to achieve near&#8208;unity PLQYs, but also greatly enhances the chirality induction from organic ligands to inorganic units in these 0D HMHs. Furthermore, the choice of different chiral ligands can modify the strength of hydrogen bonding interactions in these 0D HMHs, to maximize their glum values. Overall, this study provides a robust way to realize efficient CPL in chiral HMHs, expanding their applications in chiroptical fields.

         <title>A Semisynthetic Bioluminescence Sensor for Ratiometric Imaging of Metal Ions In Vivo Using DNAzymes Conjugated to An Engineered Nano&#8208;Luciferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fusion protein of Nano&#8208;luciferase and HaloTag was engineered to construct a DNAzyme sensor for metal ion detection in vivo, utilizing bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET).







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based probes have gained significant attention as versatile tools for biochemical analysis, benefiting from their programmability and biocompatibility. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation&#8208;independent and ratiometric imaging of the target in vivo. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano&#8208;luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn2+, the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore&#8208;labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn2+ in vivo and endogenous Zn2+ efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors.

     alt="A Semisynthetic Bioluminescence Sensor for Ratiometric Imaging of Metal Ions In Vivo Using DNAzymes Conjugated to An Engineered Nano-Luciferase"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fusion protein of Nano-luciferase and HaloTag was engineered to construct a DNAzyme sensor for metal ion detection &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, utilizing bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA-based probes have gained significant attention as versatile tools for biochemical analysis, benefiting from their programmability and biocompatibility. However, most existing DNA-based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation-independent and ratiometric imaging of the target &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano-luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore-labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;i&gt;+&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and endogenous Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors. This work expands the DNAzyme sensors to using bioluminescence and thus has enriched the toolbox of nucleic acid sensors for a broad range of biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Metallic Superionic Layers Suppressing Voltage Fading of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Towards Superior&#8208;Stable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich layer oxide (LRLO) cathodes with semi&#8208;metallic superionic layers are prepared via a simple one&#8208;step modification. The inner semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO), has spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons that can bond with oxygen, preventing oxygen release. The outer fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 (LNO) acts as a fast&#8208;ion conductor facilitating Li+ migration and alleviating metal dissolution.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs) with greater specific capacity density are constrained by voltage attenuation and inferior rate performance because of irreversible oxygen release, metal dissolving and poor lithium&#8208;ion transport capacity. Herein, a simple surface modification is designed to solve the performance degradation and structural collapse of LRLOs. Combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO) with spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, is introduced to the surface of the cathode restrains the activated surficial lattice oxygen ions by its stable oxygen vacancies. Additionally, Ni doping results in a fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 structure (LNO) with lowered lithium ions diffusion barrier, which is tightly conjugating to substrate and synergistically reinforces the Li diffusion path through the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Moreover, Mn dissolution is successfully relieved due to the decrease in Mn concentration in the coating layers. As a result, the modified material (LRLO@LMO@LNO) exhibits an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 120.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;C with a very small discharge voltage attenuation of 313&#8197;mV after 600&#8197;cycles (0.52&#8197;mV per cycle) at 1&#8197;C. Undoubtedly, this method discloses a simple and effective approach to promote the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density.

         <title>Tribochemically Controlled Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Enabled by Contact Electrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound or ball milling of piezoelectric particles to control atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) requires high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency mechanical stimuli. Tribochemically controlled ATRP (tribo&#8208;ATRP) using titanium oxide particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethylamine enables a contact&#8208;electrification catalysis (ca. 10&#8197;Hz) and gives access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Traditional mechanochemically controlled reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) utilizes ultrasound or ball milling to regenerate activators, which induce side reactions because of the high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency stimuli. Here, we propose a facile approach for tribochemically controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (tribo&#8208;ATRP) that relies on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) between titanium oxide (TiO2) particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethylamine (TPMA), without any high&#8208;energy input. Under the friction induced by stirring, the TiO2 particles are electrified, continuously reducing CuBr2/TPMA into CuBr/TPMA, thereby conversing alkyl halides into active radicals to start ATRP. In addition, the effect of friction on the reaction was elucidated by theoretical simulation. The results indicated that increasing the frequency could reduce the energy barrier for the electron transfer from TiO2 particles to CuBr2/TPMA. In this study, the design of tribo&#8208;ATRP was successfully achieved, enabling CEC (ca. 10&#8197;Hz) access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.

         <title>An Encodable Scaffold for Sequence&#8208;Specific Recognition of Duplex RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA, unlike DNA, folds into a multitude of secondary and tertiary structures. This structural diversity has impeded the development of ligands that can sequence&#8208; specifically target this biomolecule. We sought to develop ligands for double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments, which are ubiquitous in RNA tertiary structure. The major groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA is sequence&#8208;specifically recognized by a range of dimeric helical transcription factors, including the basic leucine zippers (bZIP) and basic helix loop helix (bHLH) proteins; however, such simple structural motifs are not prevalent in RNA&#8208;binding proteins. We interrogated the high&#8208;resolution structures of DNA and RNA to identify requirements for a helix fork motif to occupy dsRNA major grooves akin to dsDNA. Our analysis suggested that the rigidity and angle of approach of dimeric helices in bZIP/bHLH motifs is not ideal for binding of dsRNA major grooves. This investigation revealed that the replacement of the leucine zipper motifs in bHLH proteins with synthetic crosslinkers would allow recognition of dsRNA. We show that a model bHLH DNA&#8208;binding motif does not bind dsRNA but can be reengineered as an RNA ligand. Based on this hypothesis, we rationally designed miniature synthetic crosslinked helix fork (CHF) as a generalizable proteomimetic scaffold for targeting dsRNA.</dc:description>

         <title>A Broad Light&#8208;Harvesting Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Enables Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in a Bacterial Biohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new strategy to enable light&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation in non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria by integrating the novel conjugated oligoelectrolyte COE&#8208;IC into A. vinelandii. Upon excitation of light, COE&#8208;IC generates electron equivalents at the abiotic&#8208;biotic interface. These photoelectrons are then transferred to nitrogenase, which drives the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia.







Abstract
We report a rationally designed membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), namely COE&#8208;IC, which endows aerobic N2&#8208;fixing bacteria Azotobacter vinelandii with a light&#8208;harvesting ability that enables photosynthetic ammonia production. COE&#8208;IC possesses an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) type conjugated core, which promotes visible light absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore, COE&#8208;IC spontaneously associates with A. vinelandii to form a biohybrid in which the COE is intercalated within the lipid bilayer membrane. In the presence of L&#8208;ascorbate as a sacrificial electron donor, the resulting COE&#8208;IC/A. vinelandii biohybrid showed a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in light&#8208;driven ammonia production, as compared to the control. Photoinduced enhancement of bacterial biomass and production of L&#8208;amino acids is also observed. Introduction of isotopically enriched 15N2 atmosphere led to the enrichment of 15N&#8208;containing intracellular metabolites, consistent with the products being generated from atmospheric N2.

         <title>Materials Space&#8208;Tectonics: Atomic&#8208;level Compositional and Spatial Control Methodologies for Synthesis of Future Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent examples of material synthesis based on designing building blocks (i.e., tectons) and their hybridization. It provides practical guidelines for successfully implementing materials syntheses and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of practical applications. Lastly, the potential integration of materials space&#8208;tectonics with emerging technologies, such as materials informatics, is discussed.







Abstract
Reactions occurring at surfaces and interfaces necessitate the creation of well&#8208;designed surface and interfacial structures. To achieve a combination of bulk material (i.e., framework) and void spaces, a meticulous process of &#8220;nano&#8208;architecting&#8221; of the available space is necessary. Conventional porous materials such as mesoporous silica, zeolites, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks lack advanced cooperative functionalities owing to their largely monotonous pore geometries and limited conductivities. To overcome these limitations and develop functional structures with surface&#8208;specific functions, the novel materials space&#8208;tectonics methodology has been proposed for future materials synthesis. This review summarizes recent examples of materials synthesis based on designing building blocks (i.e., tectons) and their hybridization, along with practical guidelines for implementing materials syntheses and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of practical applications. Lastly, the potential integration of materials space&#8208;tectonics with emerging technologies, such as materials informatics, is discussed.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxidation of Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is the most crucial issue hindering the development of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. This review concentrates on the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites from the chemical mechanism, detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level, and especially intrinsic causes/extrinsic causes to provide clear guidelines to accurately suppress the oxidation.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites as the most promising absorber materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved the record efficiency of over 14&#8201;%. Although suppressing the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is a frequently concerned topic for Sn&#8208;based PSCs, many studies have given vague explanations and the mechanisms are still under debate. This is in principal due to the lack of an in&#8208;depth understanding of various and complex intrinsic and extrinsic factors causing the oxidation process. In this context, we critically review the chemical mechanism of facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and differentiate its detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level. More importantly, we classify and introduce the intrinsic factors (raw materials and solvent of perovskite precursors) and extrinsic factors (exposure to neutral oxygen and superoxide) causing the oxidation with their corresponding anti&#8208;oxidation improvement methods. The presented comprehensive understanding and prospect of the oxidation provide insightful guidance for suppressing the oxidation in Sn&#8208;based PSCs &#8220;from the beginning to the end&#8221;.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Alignment of Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes Inside Thermally Conductive Liquid Crystalline Polyimide Composite Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The positive liquid crystals, 4'&#8208;heptyl&#8208;4&#8208;biphenylcarbonitrile (7CB), are used to functionalize carbon nanotubes (LC&#8208;CNT), which can be aligned in the liquid crystalline polyimide (LC&#8208;PI) matrix under an alternating electric field to fabricate the thermally conductive LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films. The efficient establishment of thermal conduction pathways in thermally conductive LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films with a low amount of LC&#8208;CNT is achieved through the oriented alignment of LC&#8208;CNT within the LC&#8208;PI matrix. When the mass fraction of LC&#8208;CNT is 15 wt%, the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;&#8741;) and the through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;&#8869;) of the LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films reach 4.02 W/(m&#183;K) and 0.55 W/(m&#183;K), which are 90.5% and 71.9% higher than those of the intrinsically thermally conductive LC&#8208;PI films respectively, also 28.8% and 5.8% higher than those of the CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films respectively. Meanwhile, the thermally conductive LC&#8208;CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films also possess excellent mechanical and heat resistance properties. The Young&#8217;s modulus and the heat resistance index are 2.3 GPa and 297.7oC, respectively, which are higher than the intrinsically thermally conductive LC&#8208;PI films and the thermally conductive CNT/LC&#8208;PI composite films under the same amount of CNT.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen Bond Network Enables High Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage aqueous rechargeable energy storage devices with safety and high specific energy are hopeful candidates for the future energy storage system. However, the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes is a great challenge. Herein, inspired by density functional theory (DFT), polyethylene glycol (PEG) can interact strongly with water molecules, effectively reconstructing the hydrogen bond network. In addition, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) can coordinate with Zn2+, assisting in the rapid desolvation of Zn2+ and stable plating/stripping process. Remarkably, by introducing PEG400 and DMF as co&#8208;solvents into the electrolyte, a wide electrochemical window of 4.27 V can be achieved. The shift in spectra indicate the transformation in the number and strength of hydrogen bonds, verifying the reconstruction of hydrogen bond network, which can largely inhibit the activity of water molecule, according well with the molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and online electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OEMS). Based on this electrolyte, symmetric Zn cells survived up to 5000 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2, and high voltage aqueous zinc ion supercapacitors assembled with Zn anode and activated carbon cathode achieved 800 cycles at 0.1A g&#8208;1. This work provides a feasible approach for constructing high&#8208;voltage alkali metal ion supercapacitors through reconstruction strategy of hydrogen bond network.</dc:description>

         <title>Target&#8208;Specific Bioorthogonal Reactions for Precise Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry is a promising complement to natural chemical transformation to dissect biological processes in the native environment. Recently, bioorthogonal reactions are garnering considerable attention in the field of medicine for disease treatment, which exhibits improved drug efficacy and reduced side effects via in situ drug synthesis. To perform precise biomedical applications, it is a prerequisite to enable the reactions to happen in the right place for the right therapeutic targets. In this review, we highlight the design and emerging frontier of targeted bioorthogonal reactions for precise treatment. At first, we compile recent tactics for achieving target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions. Further, we emphasize their application for precise treatment of different therapeutic targets. Finally, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for safe, efficient, and clinically translatable disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminally Chlorinated and Thiophene&#8208;linked Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor Structured 3D Acceptors with Versatile Processability for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To exploit the potential of our newly developed three&#8208;dimensional (3D) dimerized acceptors, a series of chlorinated 3D acceptors (namely CH8&#8208;3/4/5) were reported by precisely tuning the position of chlorine (Cl) atom. The introduction of Cl atom in central unit affects the molecular conformation. Whereas, by replacing fluorinated terminal groups (CH8&#8208;3) with chlorinated terminal groups (CH8&#8208;4 and CH8&#8208;5), the red&#8208;shift absorption and enhanced crystallization are achieved. Benefiting from these, all devices received promising power conversion efficiency (PCEs) over 16% as well as decent thermal/photo&#8208;stabilities. Among them, PM6:CH8&#8208;4 based device yielded a best PCE of 17.58%. Besides, the 3D merits with multi alkyl chains enable their versatile processability during the device preparation. Impressive PCEs of 17.27% and 16.23% could be achieved for non&#8208;halogen solvent processable devices prepared in glovebox and ambient, respectively. 2.88 cm2 modules also obtained PCEs over 13% via spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods, respectively. These results are among the best performance of dimerized acceptors. The decent performance of CH8&#8208;4 on small&#8208;area devices, modules and non&#8208;halogen solvent&#8208;processed devices highlights the versatile processing capability of our 3D acceptors, as well as their potential applications in the future.</dc:description>

The decent performance of CH8-4 on small-area devices, modules and non-halogen solvent-processed devices highlights the versatile processing capability of our 3D acceptors, as well as their potential applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Ethanol Complete Electrooxidation via Introducing Ethylene as the Precursor for the C&#8722;C Bond Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crucial issue restricting the application of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) is the incomplete and sluggish electrooxidation of ethanol due to the chemically stable C&#8208;C bond thereof. Herein, a unique ethylene&#8208;mediated pathway with a 100% C1&#8208;selectivity for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is proposed for the first time based on a well&#8208;structured Pt/Al2O3@TiAl catalyst with cascade active sites. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) analysis disclose that ethanol is primarily dehydrated on the surface of Al2O3@TiAl and the derived ethylene is further oxidized completely on nanostructured Pt. X&#8208;ray absorption and density functional theory (DFT) studies disclose the Al component doped in Pt nanocrystals can promote the EOR kinetics by lowering the reaction energy barriers and eliminating the poisonous species. Strikingly, Pt/Al2O3@TiAl exhibits a specific activity of 3.83 mA cm&#8208;2Pt, 7.4 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and superior long&#8208;term durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Metallonitrene Formation by N2&#160;Elimination from Azide Diradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal nitrides/nitrenes are highly promising reagents for catalytic nitrogen atom transfer reactivity. They are typically prepared in situ upon optically induced N2&#8208;elimination from azido precursors. A full exploitation of their catalytic potential, however, requires in&#8208;depth knowledge of the primary photo&#8208;induced processes and the structural/electronic factors mediating the N2&#8208;loss with birth of the terminal metal&#8208;nitrogen core. Using femtosecond infrared&#8208;spectroscopy, we elucidate here the primary molecular&#8208;level mechanisms responsible for the formation of a unique platinum(II) nitrene with a triplet ground state from a closed&#8208;shell platinum(II) azide precursor. The spectroscopic data in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide compelling evidence that product formation requires the initial occupation of a singlet excited state with an anionic azide diradical ligand that is bound to a low&#8208;spin d8&#8208;configured PtII ion. Subsequent intersystem&#8208;crossing generates the Pt&#8208;bound triplet azide diradical, which smoothly evolves into the triplet nitrene via N2&#8211;loss in a near barrierless adiabatic dissociation. Our data highlight the importance of the productive, N2&#8208;releasing state possessing azide &#960;&#960;* character as a design principle for accessing efficient N&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence of Mn2+ in the Borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4]:Mn2+ &#8208; A Tool to Detect Weak Coordination Behavior of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impact of the surrounding ligand field is successfully exploited in the case of Eu2+ to tune the emission characteristics of inorganic photoactive materials with potential application in e.g., phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;wLEDs). However, the photoluminescence of Mn2+ related to intraconfigurational 3d5&#8208;3d5 transitions is also strongly dependent on local ligand field effects and has been underestimated in this regard so far. In this work, we want to revive the idea how to electronically tune the emission color of a transition metal ion in inorganic hosts by unusual electronic effects in the metal&#8208;ligand bond. The concept is explicitly demonstrated for the weakly coordinating layer&#8208;like borosulfate ligand in the Mn(II)&#8208;containing solid solutions Zn1&#8208;xMnx[B2(SO4)4] (x&#8239;=&#8239;0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10). Zn[B2(SO4)4]:Mn2+ shows orange narrow&#8208;band luminescence at 590&#8239;nm, which is an unusually short wavelength for octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ and indicates an uncommonly weak ligand field. On the other hand, the analysis of the interelectronic Racah repulsion parameters reveals ionic Mn&#8208;O bonds with values close to the Racah parameters of the free Mn2+ ion. Overall, this strategy demonstrates that electronic control of the metal&#8208;ligand bond can be a tool to make Mn2+ a potent alternative emitter to Eu2+ for inorganic phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Chemically Innocent Polyanions in Active, Chemically Fueled Complex Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex coacervation describes the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of oppositely charged polymers. Active coacervates are droplets in which one of the electrolyte&#180;s affinity is regulated by chemical reactions. These droplets are particularly interesting because they are tightly regulated by reaction kinetics. For example, they serve as a model for membraneless organelles that are also often regulated by biochemical transformations such as posttranslational modifications. They are also a great protocell model or could be used to synthesize life&#8212;they spontaneously emerge in response to reagents, compete, and decay when all nutrients have been consumed. However, the role of the unreactive building blocks, e.g., the polymeric compounds, is poorly understood. Here, we show the important role of the chemically innocent, unreactive polyanion of our chemically fueled coacervation droplets. We show that the polyanion drastically influences the resulting droplets' life cycle without influencing the chemical reaction cycle&#8212;either they are very dynamic or have a delayed dissolution. Additionally, we derive a mechanistic understanding of our observations and show how additives and rational polymer design help to create the desired coacervate emulsion life cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanostructure Explains the Behavior of Slippery Covalently Attached Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Slippery covalently&#8208;attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH, &lt;5&#9702;) and nanoscale thickness display impressive anti&#8208;adhesive properties, similar to lubricant&#8208;infused surfaces. Their efficacy is generally attributed to the
liquid&#8208;like mobility of the constituent tethered chains. However, the precise physico&#8208;chemical properties that facilitate this mobility are
unknown, hindering rational design.
This work quantifies the chain length, grafting density, and microviscosity of a range of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SCALS, elucidating
the nanostructure responsible for their properties. Three prominent methods are used to produce SCALS, with characterization
carried out via single&#8208;molecule force measurements, neutron reflectometry, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. CO2 snow&#8208;jet
cleaning was also shown to reduce the CAH of SCALS via a modification of their grafting density. SCALS behavior can be predicted
by reduced grafting density, &#931;, with the lowest water CAH achieved at &#931; &#8776; 2. This study provides the first direct examination of
SCALS grafting density, chain length, and microviscosity and supports the hypothesis that SCALS properties stem from a balance of
layer uniformity and mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;cost and Non&#8208;flammable Eutectic Electrolytes for Advanced Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a burgeoning electrolyte system, eutectic electrolytes based on ZnCl2/Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2 have been widely proposed in advanced Zn&#8211;I2 batteries; however, safety and cost concerns significantly limit their applications. Here, we report new&#8208;type ZnSO4&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes that are both safe and cost&#8208;effective. Their universality is evident in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols, in which multiple &#8211;OH groups not only involve in Zn2+ solvation but also interact with water, resulting in the high stability of electrolytes. Taking propylene glycol&#8208;based hydrate eutectic electrolyte (HEE) as an example, it features significant advantages in non&#8208;flammability and low price that is &lt; 1/200 cost of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes. Moreover, its effectiveness in confining the shuttle effects of I2 cathode and side reactions of Zn anodes is evidenced, resulting in Zn&#8211;I2 coin cells with high reversibility at 1 C and 91.4% capacity remaining under 20 C. After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3 mg cm&#8211;2, super&#8208;high&#8208;capacity retention of 96.7% is achieved after 500 cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.</dc:description>

After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3 mg cm&#8211;2, super-high-capacity retention of 96.7% is achieved after 500 cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Molecular Ratchets: Tools Enabling Endergonic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;equilibrium chemical systems underpin multiple domains of contemporary interest, including supramolecular chemistry, molecular machines, systems chemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and energy transduction. Experimental chemists are now pioneering the realization of artificial systems that can harvest energy away from equilibrium. In this tutorial review, we provide an overview of artificial molecular ratchets: the chemical mechanisms enabling energy absorption from the environment. By focusing on the mechanism type &#8211; rather than the application domain or energy source &#8211; we offer a unifying picture of seemingly disparate phenomena, which we hope will foster progress in this fascinating domain of science.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Fe&#8208;N4 Sites through Anion Exchange&#8208;mediated Transformation of Fe Coordination Environments in Hierarchical Carbon Support for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal single atoms (SAs) anchored in carbon support via coordinating with N atoms are efficient active sites to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, rational design of single atom catalysts with highly exposed active sites is challenging and urgently desirable. Herein, an anion exchange strategy is presented to fabricate Fe&#8208;N4 moieties anchored in hierarchical carbon nanoplates composed of hollow carbon spheres (Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS). With the coordinating O atoms are substituted by N atoms, Fe SAs with Fe&#8208;O4 configuration are transformed into the ones with Fe&#8208;N4 configuration during the thermal activation process. Insights into the evolution of central atoms demonstrate that the SAs with specific coordination environment can be obtained by modulating in situ anion exchange process. The strategy produces a large quantity of electrochemical accessible site and high utilization rate of Fe&#8208;N4. Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS shows excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, and outstanding performance when used in rechargeable aqueous and flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries. The evolution pathway for SAs demonstrated in this work offers a novel strategy to design SACs with various coordination environment and enhanced electrocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Second&#8208;Annealed 2D/3D Perovskite Films with Graded Energy Funnels and Toughened Heterointerfaces for Efficient and Durable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures have been widely investigated to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, rational manipulation of phase distribution and energy level alignment in such 2D/3D perovskite hybrids are still of great challenge. Herein, we successfully achieved spontaneous phase alignment of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures by concurrently introducing both 2D perovskite component and organic halide additive. The graded phase distribution of 2D perovskites with different n values and 3D perovskites induced favorable energy band alignment across the perovskite film and boosted the charge transfer at the relevant heterointerfaces. Moreover, the 2D perovskite component also acted as a &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; to simultaneously passivate the defects and release the residual tensile stress of perovskite films. Encouragingly, the blade&#8208;coated PSCs based on only ~2s in&#8208;situ flash annealed 2D/3D perovskite films with favorable energy funnels and toughened heterointerfaces achieved promising efficiencies of 22.5%, accompanied by extended lifespan. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported efficiency for the PSCs fabricated with energy&#8208;saved thermal treatment just within a few seconds, which also outperformed those state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art annealing&#8208;free analogues. Such two&#8208;seconds in&#8208;situ annealing technique could save the energy cost by up to 99.6% during device fabrication, which will grant its low&#8208;coast implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Foldamer&#8208;Based Artificial Lithium Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike many other biologically relevant ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl&#8208;, etc) and protons, whose cellular concentrations are closely regulated by highly selective channel proteins, Li+ ion is unusual in that its concentration is well tolerated over many orders of magnitude and that no lithium&#8208;specific channel proteins have so far been identified. While one naturally evolved primary pathway for lithium ions to traverse across the cell membrane is through sodium channels by competing with sodium ions, highly sought&#8208;after artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels remain a major challenge to develop. Here we show that sulfur&#8208;containing organic nanotubes derived from intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded helically folded aromatic foldamers of 3.6 &#197; in hollow cavity diameter could facilitate highly selective and efficient transmembrane transport of Li+ ions, with high transport selectivity factors of 14.9 and 18.4 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the Magnetic Blocking Temperature of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), magnetic complexes capable of retaining magnetization blocking for a long time at elevated temperatures, has been a major concern for magnetochemists over the last three decades. In this review, we describe basic SMMs and the different approaches that allow high magnetization&#8208;blocking temperatures to be reached. We focus on the basic factors affecting magnetization blocking, magnetic axiality and the height of the blocking barrier, which can be used to group different families of complexes in terms of their SMM efficiency. Finally, we discuss several practical routes for the design of mono&#8208; and polynuclear complexes that could be applied in memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating&#160;the Sequence Structure of Conjugated Block Copolymers&#160;Enables Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) based on conjugated block copolymers (CBCs) by covalently bonding polymer donor and polymer acceptor become more and more appealing, due to the formation of favorable and stable morphology. Unfortunately, deeply understanding the effect of the assembly behavior caused by sequence structure of CBCs on the device performance is still ambiguous. Herein, from the aspect of manipulating the sequence length and distribution regularity of CBCs, we synthesized a series of new CBCs, namely D18(20)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT and D18(60)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by two&#8208;pot polymerization, and D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT(r) by traditional one&#8208;pot method. It is observed that precise manipulation of sequence length and distribution regularity of the polymer blocks fine&#8208;tunes the self&#8208;assembly of the CBCs, optimizes film morphology, improves optoelectronic properties and reduces energy loss, leading to simultaneously improved efficiency and stability. Among these CBCs, the D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device achieves a champion efficiency of 13.4% with enhanced stability, which is the outstanding performance of SCOSCs. Importantly, the regular sequence distribution and suitable sequence length of the CBCs enable a facile film&#8208;forming process of the printed device. For the first time, the blade&#8208;coated large&#8208;area rigid/flexible SCOSCs are fabricated, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.62%/10.73%, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris&#8208;benzo[cd]indole Cyanine Enables the NIR&#8208;photosensitized Radical and Thiol&#8208;ene Polymerizations at 940 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing heptamethine (HM+) incorporating three bulky benzo[cd]indole heterocycles was designed to efficiently prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the dye, which results in a strong enhancement of its photoinitiating reactivity as compared to a parent bis&#8208;benzo[cd]indole heptamethine (HMCl+) used as a reference system. In this context, we highlight an efficient free&#8208;radical NIR&#8208;polymerization up to a 100% acrylates C=C bonds conversion even under air conditions. Such an important initiating performance was obtained by incorporating our NIR&#8208;sensitizer into a three&#8208;component system leading to its self&#8208;regeneration. This original photoredox cycle was thoroughly investigated through the identification of each intermediary species using EPR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the Upper Limit of Nucleophilicity Scales by Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of mesoionic, 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs), which have an extraordinarily electron&#8208;rich exocyclic CC&#8208;double bond, were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized, in selected cases by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The kinetics of their reactions with arylidene malonates, ArCH=C(CO2Et)2, which gave zwitterionic adducts, were investigated photometrically in THF at 20 &#176;C. The resulting second&#8208;order rate constants k2(20&#160;&#176;C) correlate linearly with the reported electrophilicity parameters E of the arylidene malonates (reference electrophiles), thus providing the nucleophile&#8208;specific N and sN parameters of the mNHOs according to the correlation lg k2(20&#176;C) = sN(N + E). With 21 &lt; N &lt; 32, the mNHOs are much stronger nucleophiles than conventional NHOs. Some mNHOs even excel the reactivity of mono&#8208; and diacceptor&#8208;substituted carbanions. It is exemplarily shown that the reactivity parameters thus obtained allow to calculate the rate constants for mNHO reactions with further Michael acceptors and predict the scope of reactions with other electrophilic reaction partners including carbon dioxide, which gives zwitterionic mNHO&#8208;carboxylates. The nucleophilicity parameters N correlate linearly with a linear combination of the quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl cation affinities and buried volumes of mNHOs, which offers a valuable tool to tailor the reactivities of strong carbon nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>eHydrogenation: Electrochemical Hydrogen&#8208;free hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation reactions are staple transformations commonly used across scientific fields to synthesise pharmaceuticals, natural products, and various functional materials. However, the vast majority of these reactions require the use of a toxic and costly catalyst leading to unpractical, hazardous and often functionally limited conditions. Herein, we report a new, general, practical, efficient, mild and high&#8208;yielding hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical method for the reduction of alkene, alkyne, nitro and azido groups. Finally, this method has been applied to deuterium labelling.</dc:description>

         <title>MIDA and TIDA Boronates Stabilize &#945;&#8208;Radicals Through B&#8208;N Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional organoboron compounds increasingly enable the simple generation of complex, Csp3&#8208;rich small molecules. The ability of boron&#8208;containing functional groups to modify the reactivity of &#160;&#945;&#8208;radicals has also enabled a myriad of chemical reactions. Boronic esters with vacant p&#8208;orbitals have a significant stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals due to delocalization of spin density into the empty orbital. The effect of coordinatively saturated derivatives, such as N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates and counterparts, remains less clear. Herein, we demonstrate that coordinatively saturated MIDA and TIDA boronates stabilize secondary alkyl &#945;&#8208;radicals via &#963;B&#8208;N hyperconjugation in a manner that allows site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H bromination. DFT calculated radical stabilization energies and spin density maps as well as LED&#8208;NMR kinetic analysis of photochemical bromination rates of different boronic esters further these findings. This work clarifies that the &#945;&#8208;radical stabilizing effect of boronic esters does not only proceed via delocalization of radical character into vacant boron p&#8208;orbitals, but that hyperconjugation of tetrahedral boron&#8208;containing functional groups and their ligand electron delocalizing ability also play a critical role. These findings establish boron ligands as a useful dial for tuning reactivity at the a&#8208;carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling New Approaches:&#160;Recent Advances in Processing Aliphatic Polycarbonate&#8208;Based Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polycarbonates (aPCs) have become increasingly popular as functional materials due to their biocompatibility and capacity for on&#8208;demand degradation. Advances in polymerization techniques and the introduction of new functional monomers have expanded the library of aPCs available, offering a diverse range of chemical compositions and structures. To accommodate the emerging requirements of new applications in biomedical and energy&#8208;related fields, various manufacturing techniques have been adopted for processing aPC&#8208;based materials. However, a summary of these techniques has yet to be conducted. The aim of this paper is to enrich the toolbox available to researchers, enabling them to select the most suitable technique for their materials. In this paper, a concise review of the recent progress in processing techniques, including controlled self&#8208;assembly, electrospinning, additive manufacturing, and other techniques, is presented. We also highlight the specific challenges and opportunities for the sustainable growth of this research area and the successful integration of aPCs in industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>H2&#8208;free Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Butadiene by the Atomic Sieving Effect of Pd Membrane with Tree&#8208;like Pd Dendrites Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2&#8208;free semi&#8208;hydrogenation at room temperature shows great advantage for replacing the thermocatalytic process in industry owing to the high energy and resource saving, however, remains great challenges. Herein, a tree&#8208;like Pd dendrites array decorated Pd membrane was constructed as the core device in an electrochemistry assisted gas&#8208;fed membrane reactor for butadiene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. It reveals that hydrogen atomic sieving effect of this Pd&#8208;based membrane under electrochemical condition was the key for semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The configuration study of Pd nanostructured membrane demonstrates that the penetration of hydrogen atoms through Pd membrane from electrochemical side to chemical side is affected by the consumption of hydrogen atom in semi&#8208;hydrogenation step. Such atomic sieving property of nanostructured Pd membrane with 5.1 times increase in catalytic active surface area brings above 14 times higher in butadiene conversion than that of bare Pd foil, with ~90% of butenes selectivity at butadiene conversion ~98% over 300h of H2&#8208;free reaction under 15 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>
